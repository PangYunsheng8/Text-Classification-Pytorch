{"text-0": {"text": "Sports stars weigh in on row over transgender athletes\nFirst it was Martina Navratilova. Then Paula Radcliffe and Kelly Holmes. Now, almost with every passing day, there are more voices wading into the issue of whether transgender competitors should be allowed to take part in women\u2019s sport.\nOver the weekend, the swimmer Sharron Davies, a silver medallist at the 1980 Olympics, became the latest to lend her support to a campaign led by the pressure group Fair Play for Women. \u201cI believe there is a fundamental difference between the binary sex you are born with and the gender you may identify as,\u201d Davies said. \u201cTo protect women\u2019s sport, those with a male sex advantage should not be able to compete in women\u2019s sport.\u201d\nHer remarks drew criticism from Rachel McKinnon, a transgender cyclist who won a Masters Track World Championship title in October, who said Davies was a \u201ctransphobe\u201d and was \u201csharing hate speech\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no debate to be had over whether trans women athletes have an unfair advantage: it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t,\u201d McKinnon wrote. \u201cSince the Nov 2003 IOC policy openly allowing trans women to compete, not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal.\u201d\nBut Fair Play for Women insists women are clearly disadvantaged at both elite and grassroots level when they compete against trans athletes.\n\u201cClaims of transphobia are wild and unfounded,\u201d its spokeswoman Dr Nicola Williams told the Guardian. \u201cIt is a tool used to shame women into silence. We want to get past not being able to speak out and to encourage a debate that leads to sports bodies implementing policies that are fair to women.\n\u201cWe have actively tried to reach out to high-profile former athletes like Sharron and Martina to say: look, we have a problem here. Because I know of some women athletes who have been told they will have their sponsorship removed if they speak about this issue which could threaten their careers.\u201d\nAll scientists agree that testosterone during growth, puberty and maturation results in large differences between the sexes. The debate is whether those advantages are lost if a trans gender athlete takes medication to reduce that testosterone.\nAs things stand, the International Olympic Committee allows trans women to compete as long as they have been reducing their testosterone levels for 12 months. However, Fair Play for Women believes there is little science behind the IOC\u2019s policy and says there is a \u201clegacy effect of testosterone\u201d that gives an unfair strength advantage even after the current level of the hormone is reduced.\nGoverning bodies are clearly undecided about how best to deal with the questions of gender, biology and identity that arise from the issue. Last year Hannah Mouncey, a former member of the Australian men\u2019s handball team, was blocked from playing in Aussie rules football\u2019s professional women\u2019s league on the grounds of strength and physique.\nHowever, Laurel Hubbard, a New Zealand weightlifter who competed in men\u2019s competition before transitioning at the age of 35, was allowed to take part in the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nThe issue is also of increasing importance in schools and grassroots sport. Some US states, for instance, allow people to self-identify as women without reducing their testosterone, which Williams says could impact on others getting sporting scholarships for college, which would be unfair and discriminatory.\n\u201cSelf-identification policies, where someone simply has to declare themselves as female, will have a impact on the women and girls competing now and in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so vastly unfair. Why would you want to compete in a sport where you literally can never win?\n\u201cThe problem is national governing bodies in the UK don\u2019t have a policy on this. Whenever I speak to them they say the policy is under review \u2013 they are always waiting for someone else to make the first move. We are in limbo now and it is causing problems.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Navratilova, who had a trans coach, apologised for saying a fortnight ago that trans athletes were cheating. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that because I certainly was not suggesting that transgender athletes in general are cheats,\u201d she said. \u201cI attached the label to a notional case in which someone cynically changes gender, perhaps temporarily, to gain a competitive advantage. We should not be blind to the possibility and some of these rules are making that possible and legal.\u201d\nBoth Navratilova and Davies are calling for sports bodies to debate the issue. However, the LGBT rights group Stonewall insists the sports bodies must be fair on transgender athletes, too. \u201cSport should be welcoming to everyone, including trans people,\u201d it said. \u201cWe need clubs and governing bodies, as the experts, to consider how their sports\u2019 individual policies can work to be as inclusive as possible, to ensure all people, including trans people, can take part in sport.\u201d\nRadcliffe, meanwhile, who has previously said trans women being able to compete \u201cmakes a mockery of the definitions of male and female sports categories\u201d, said: \u201cPeople are scared to talk about the issue. But I believe protecting women\u2019s sport is important.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-1": {"text": "Lungs review \u2013 Claire Foy and Matt Smith shine in climate crisis drama\n\u2018The world is fucked,\u201d says one half of the earnest couple in Lungs, fretting about starting a family on an over-populated planet. Since Duncan Macmillan\u2019s play about modern love and the climate crisis was first staged in 2011, it feels like the world has become even more so. The script\u2019s debates on individual responsibility for saving the planet take on renewed significance amid the rise of public protest and Extinction Rebellion.\nThe unnamed couple, played magnetically by Claire Foy and Matt Smith, worry about the polar bears and eating imported avocados. Their hand-wringing carries its own middle-class hypocrisies. They angst over the carbon footprint of a prospective baby (\u201c10,000 tonnes of CO2\u201d) and consider planting trees to offset the damage. But they sound like helicopter parents from the minute she gets pregnant. Their neuroses and double standards are gently derided, but the idealism to be \u201cgood people\u201d is not undermined altogether.\nFoy and Smith perform this two-hander after having honed their chemistry in Netflix series The Crown, and it is an achievement that they are not defined by those roles. These characters are instantly convincing as a trendy young couple arguing in an Ikea queue: she is a PhD student in dungarees and rolled up shirt sleeves, he is a new man in Nike trainers, nodding along to her stridency. Their rat-a-tat repartee of the early scenes is sharp and funny, but frenetic, too, and the drama gathers powers as it slows and introduces silences.\nRob Howell\u2019s set design, like the original, is minimalist to the extreme, empty but for a solar-panelled floor and two tiles on opposite sides propped up by rock crystals \u2013 a sly satirical reminder of the couple\u2019s fashionable, new age environmentalism. The bareness on stage forces the actors to do all the work; for Foy and Smith, it allows them to showcase their natural synergy, sometimes with a hint of swagger. But it also works on a metaphorical level in stripping their relationship down to its bones.\nTheir existential crisis is as much about sexual politics as it is about the environment. As an enlightened modern couple, they reverse traditional gender relations to some degree: Foy is more dominant, forcing her counterpart into the ancillary role as she monologues about the planet, motherhood and his predatory gaze when they have sex (\u201cSometimes it looks like you are going to hack off my limbs and bury me in the woods\u201d). Yet she also demands old-style strength and initiative from him.\nSmith, for his part, likes her honesty, but is paralysed by it: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want. I need you to give me some clues.\u201d In this bristling dynamic, they encapsulate the paradoxes of modern masculinity and empowered femininity, enacting its conflicts and contradictions brilliantly in scenes that range from comically bathetic to tender and enraged.\nMatthew Warchus\u2019s direction pits them against each other visually to mirror the verbal combat; they stand at opposite ends of the stage or circle each other in gladiatorial fashion when they are scripted to be lying in bed together.\nScenes cut away and change seamlessly so that day turns to night within seconds, a row turns into a sex scene, a breakup into a reunion. Foy and Smith manage the switches of mood and tone with a virtuosity that verges on ostentatious, and there are very few off-moments in pace. It is only the last sequence, in which times speeds up and characters, present and imagined, grow up, age or die within seconds, which feels rushed, gimmicky and riddled with cliche.\nThe couple\u2019s principles are put to one side when life takes over. Yet the message of this play is not a cynical one. It is simple a picture of flawed love, set in a flawed planet.\nAt the Old Vic, London, until 9 November.", "label": 0}, "text-2": {"text": "A sweet tale: the son who reinvented sugar to help diabetic dad\nJavier Larragoiti was 18 when his father was diagnosed with diabetes. The teenager had just started a degree in chemical engineering in Mexico City. So he dedicated his studies to a side project: creating an acceptable alternative to help his father and millions of Mexicans like him avoid sugar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only when you know someone with this sickness that you realise how common it is and how sugar intake plays a huge role,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad tried to use stevia and sucralose, just hated the taste, and kept cheating on his diet.\u201d\nThe young chemist started dabbling with xylitol, a sweet-tasting alcohol commonly extracted from birch wood and used in products such as chewing gum.\n\u201cIt has so many good properties for human health, and the same flavour as sugar, but the problem was that producing it was so expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I decided to start working on a cheaper process to make it accessible to everyone.\u201d\nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nTen years later, Larragoiti has patented a fermentation-based process to turn wasted corn cobs from Mexico\u2019s 27.5m-tonne annual crop into xylitol. It is thereby solving a second problem: what to do with all that agricultural waste that otherwise might be burned, adding greenhouse gases to the overladen atmosphere.\nHis business, Xilinat (pronounced Hill-Ee-Natt), buys waste from 13 local farmers, producing 1 tonne of the product a year. This month his invention was awarded a prestigious $310,000 Chivas Venture prize award, which will enable him to industrialise production and scale up production tenfold.\nObesity is one of the fastest-growing global health problems. One in seven people are obese and about 10% have type 2 diabetes. Since 1980 the rate of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries.\nLarragoiti says that sugary diets are a real problem in Coca-Cola-loving Mexico, which has the world\u2019s second-highest rate of obesity and has successfully taxed sugary drinks to try to combat a main source of the issue.\nParadoxically, another corn byproduct \u2013 fructose \u2013 is part of the problem, used to make corn syrup that has been linked to increasing obesity in the US.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic,\u201d Larragoiti says. \u201cHigh fructose corn syrup is just a bomb of carbs and concentrated sugar that makes a high peak of insulin. It\u2019s many times sweeter than regular glucose. Companies use and pay less and that\u2019s the issue.\u201d\nReusing agricultural waste is rapidly emerging as a promising sector for social entrepreneurs keen to tackle global heating and make useful things at the same time.\n\u201cOne corn stalk has 70% to 80% waste by weight when you get down to it,\u201d says Stefan M\u00fchlbauer, of Cormo USA Inc. His company has a pilot plant in Alsace, France, and is building another in Indiana, US, to turn corn waste into a peat moss substitute and a super-absorbent foam for filters or soil. \u201cFarmers are excited as it gives them something that extends their harvest season and they see another source of revenue,\u201d he adds.\nIn Mexico, agricultural waste is often burned, releasing greenhouse gases and creating one of the country\u2019s highest sources of dioxin emissions. \u201cBurning the residue is cheap and quick and may suppress pests and diseases,\u201d says Dr Wolter Elbersen, a crop production expert at Wageningen University & Research. \u201cThe disadvantages such as air pollution, loss of organic matter and nutrients are less appreciated apparently. Removing the material for feed or compost, or added value products such as paper pulp or fuels is often not cost-effective, or no labour is available to do all the work in a short window of time.\u201d\nBut thinking in a different way about \u201cwaste products\u201d is essential if we are going to conserve scarce resources and feed a growing population, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. \u201cWe need to think about the principles in the past, where we had to do much with little, and at the same time apply the technology we have at hand nowadays to succeed in the challenge of feeding the world,\u201d says Clementine Schouteden, who leads the global initiative on the circular economy for food at the campaigning organisation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense of urgency in making sure that we farm in a way that is regenerative, preventing waste but also [creating value from] the waste that is currently not edible, with a food industry making the right options for consumers and for the planet.\u201d\nXilinat\u2019s idea has huge potential, according to Sonal Shah, the founding executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, and a Chivas Venture judge. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that he\u2019s building a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar but that it\u2019s going to become scalable so every company that uses sugar in its food has the opportunity to rethink what kind of substitute they use,\u201d she said.\nEbersen added, though, that \u201cyou do, however, need a solution for using the leftovers after the xylose has been extracted and the demand for xylitol is small [currently] compared with the amount of residue\u201d.\nMeanwhile, what about Javier\u2019s father? \u201cMy dad is super-happy,\u201d Larragoiti says. \u201cHe uses my product every day and he\u2019s willing not to cheat on his diet any more!\u201d\n\u2022 Readers have pointed out that xylitol is highly toxic for dogs and even small amounts can be fatal.

Bookmakers get creative in gambling's changed world\nSince the essential raw material of their business is chance, bookmakers tend to assume that they will, for the most part, enjoy an unlimited supply.

And what use is a bookie when there is nothing to bet on?\nThe share prices of gambling firms are falling as fast, and in many cases even faster, than the rest of the market. William Hill closed at 148.85p on 28 February. On Friday, it was down to 39.86p, a drop of 73% in three weeks. Flutter, the parent company of Paddy Power and Betfair, said on Monday that its profits could be down by between \u00a390m and \u00a3110m in 2020. William Hill\u2019s latest estimate is a hit of \u00a3100m-\u00a3110m, while GVC, which owns Ladbrokes and Coral, put the figure at \u00a3130m-\u00a3150m.\nEven at the best of times, few have much sympathy for bookmakers. Now, at the outset of the worst times that any of us are likely to experience, there will be no sympathy at all \u2013 indeed, many will see their collapsing share prices as a small crumb of comfort as \u201cnormal\u201d life recedes into memory. Yet the gambling industry as a whole \u2013 of which bookmaking and betting is a significant part \u2013 supports at least 90,000 jobs. Like other major employers, it will have a role to play in restoring some normality to the economy when the current crisis is over.\nBet365, the biggest player in the online market but also a privately-owned business with no shareholders, announced a huge package on Friday to support more than 4,000 employees at its base in Stoke-on-Trent, guaranteeing that all salaries will be paid until the end of August.\nFor employees of their rivals in what was, until recently, a fiercely competitive market, the future is less certain. \u201cOur primary focus continues to be on protecting the welfare of our colleagues,\u201d a spokesperson for SkyBet said. \u201cOf course, the cancellation of sporting events has had an impact on our business but our customers are still able to enjoy a selection of greyhound racing, global horse racing and some other sports that are still taking place around the world.\u201d\nIt is a time to expect the unexpected. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing quite good trade on table tennis,\u201d Rupert Adams, of William Hill, says. \u201cIn terms of live matches and streaming, there\u2019s quite a lot still going on in eastern Europe at the moment. It\u2019s been quite a successful in-play event. It\u2019s good news for us that Irish racing is going ahead, and there\u2019s still racing from South Africa and Hong Kong, but it\u2019s hard and will continue to be for some time.\u201d\nWhile Ireland is the only major European racing nation still staging meetings, greyhound racing continues behind closed doors in the UK, with no fewer than 160 races scheduled in Britain on Saturday, spread throughout the day from the 8.12am at Harlow to the 10.35pm at Crayford. Crayford, in fact, staged two cards: 14 races in the morning from 10.36am to 1.57pm, and 12 more from 7.27pm to 10.35pm.\nBetting on the dogs is often seen \u2013 perhaps fairly \u2013 as a product for an older generation of punters in the (now-closed) betting shops. But while turnover on the sport dropped below \u00a31bn for the first time in 2019, that suddenly feels like a market that is worth reassessing. One option which all firms are likely to pursue vigorously is pushing customers towards fixed-margin gaming products like roulette, bingo, online slot machines and virtual racing.\n\u201cThat side of our business has never been stronger,\u201d Adams says. \u201cTen years ago, before that side was so important, we would be in trouble, there\u2019s no doubt, but I think it is fairly robust, and of course, across more countries than before.\u201d\nA gambling medium which seems to sit somewhere between the two is esports: competitive video gaming which can be live-streamed for in-play betting.

For the first time since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, Spain has a far-right party, in Vox, with muscle to match its malice. Vox increased its vote to 15% and secured 52 seats, harvesting the anger provoked by separatist clashes on the streets of Barcelona and becoming the country\u2019s third party. Tragically, that brings Spain into line with other European nations where the far-right represents up to a quarter of the electorate. The inoculation supposedly provided by 40 years of rightwing dictatorship under General Franco last century has now definitively worn off. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s decision to remove the dictator\u2019s body from his outsized tomb at the Valley of The Fallen in mid-campaign now looks like a way of burying the past, rather than learning from it.\nAt the same time, this election did nothing to resolve Spain\u2019s greatest problem \u2013 its inability to form a government. In fact, things have worsened for S\u00e1nchez, who made a terrible miscalculation by imagining that fresh elections, designed to strengthen the position of his Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE), were better than a government supported by the populist left of Podemos. Strategists told him that he had the charisma to emerge as a strongman, and he believed it. Like Britain\u2019s Theresa May in 2017, he is now a weakened and diminished figure.\nBetween them, the PSOE and Podemos now have 10 fewer seats in parliament than those they won in April, and will find it that much more difficult to govern. Few people doubt that this broad-left alliance must finally come into being. Only the left can govern because, with what Catalan separatists see as poetic justice after the prison sentences handed down to their leaders last month, the key to government now sits firmly in the hands of nationalist parties in Catalonia and the Basque country. The right\u2019s hardline stance rules them out of reaching agreements there.\nResponsibility for smashing Spain\u2019s brittle politics into even smaller pieces lies firmly with S\u00e1nchez. So does the task of gluing it back together.\nSpain is a cage full of madmen all suffering from the same mania: their inability to put up with one another\nHis attempts at looking tough during campaigning included a suggestion that any government led by him would exercise political control over the public prosecutor\u2019s office. Although he quickly apologised, this tendency towards hard-man posturing lies behind both his decision to call elections and his failure to increase his number of seats \u2013 even if 28% of the vote still makes the PSOE the largest party. While Podemos must share blame for failing to strike a deal last time, it was S\u00e1nchez who eventually nixed it \u2013 even after Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias offered to step aside.\nThis testosterone-driven \u201cwinner takes all\u201d view of Spanish politics now seems outdated. Ever since Podemos emerged five years ago with a promise to dislodge the elites who had held sway since 1978 and driven Spain over a cliff edge into brutal recession, Spaniards have been telling politicians that they no longer trust a single party to govern them. Years of corruption showed that absolute majorities \u2013 in Spain as a whole, in Catalonia or in most other regions \u2013 produced abuse and thievery.\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s caveman-like behaviour belongs to the past. Spaniards do not want a strongman leader (except, perhaps, Vox voters). They want someone who knows the value of dialogue and can bring people together. That is the message repeated, time and again, at elections. Televised election debates featured five pugnacious men. Of the five, only the disastrous Albert Rivera, who lost 80% of his liberal Citizens party\u2019s seats on Sunday, has stepped aside.\nOn past record, however, none of the others are fitted to a system of dialogue and cooperation. Instead, all seem to embrace the attitude denounced by the 19th-century writer \u00c1ngel Ganivet, who claimed too many Spaniards saw their country as \u201ca cage full of madmen all suffering from the same mania: their inability to put up with one another\u201d. Those times are long gone and new leaders are required. Any of the senior party figures who took part in a separate women-only televised debate, and in a very different tone, could do the job just as well, if not better.\nThe most poignant vote of all came from the underpopulated, rural province of Teruel, where a new party called \u201cTeruel Exists\u201d won a single parliamentary seat. It was a plaintive call for attention in a country obsessed with large cities, political point-scoring in Madrid and separatist tensions in Catalonia.\nMost Spaniards want something new \u2013 a political class which knows how to compromise and resolve their everyday problems without turning these into weapons of confrontation, in Catalonia or elsewhere.

Last year, the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas, according to the figures.\nA group of influential shareholders are now urging the bank to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies, and have filed a resolution to be voted on at Barclays\u2019 AGM in May.\nFracking has been the focus of intense business activity by investment banks since the Paris agreement, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America leading \u00a3241.53bn of financing, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion led financing for tar sands crude oil projects in Alberta, north-west Canada, which have caused widespread damage to ecosystems.\nThe big-four Chinese banks have dominated financing for coal mining and coal power since the Paris agreement and have no policies restricting business practices.\nKirsch said: \u201cThis makes it crystal clear that banks are failing miserably when it comes to responding to the urgency of the climate crisis. As the toll of death and destruction from unprecedented floods, droughts, fires and storms grows, it is unconscionable and outrageous for banks to be approving new loans and raising capital for the companies that are pushing hardest to increase carbon emissions.\u201d\nAhead of the next major international climate talks, Cop26 in Glasgow this November, the UK government has sought to make the business and the banking sector the focus of tacking the climate crisis. The former head of the Bank of England Mark Carney has been appointed as a climate envoy, warning that businesses must improve how they disclose their impact on the environment or risk failing to meet climate targets.\nJohan Frijns, director of BankTrack, an NGO which monitors the activities of major financial institutions, said it was time for banks to commit to phasing out financing for all new fossil fuel projects.\n\u201cIn the last year, banks have been queueing up to proclaim support for the goals of the Paris agreement. Both the Principles for Responsible Banking and the new Equator Principles, each signed by over a hundred banks, acknowledges the global climate goals.

The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party had agreed they didn\u2019t want an election, but then said they did want an election three days before the Tories wanted an election. But the Tories wouldn\u2019t have an election then, and anyway, some Lib Dems and SNP MPs started to worry about having an election. But none of that mattered because Labour, having not wanted an election, decided it did want one after all. Got it?\nThis election is a huge strategic error by the Tories. Or Labour. Maybe both?

Tredinnick is best known for advocating the use of astrology to take the pressure off the NHS (he\u2019s a Capricorn; they have a wacky sense of humour).

People need hope that things can change\n\u201cHell is coming,\u201d one weather forecaster tweeted this week, warning not of further political turmoil but of the hottest heatwave in decades that\u2019s advancing across continental Europe. Extreme weather events like this remind us that climate change is not a remote and distant threat \u2013 but a reality that is already taking an unacceptable human toll.\nIn recent months, Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strike have turned up the heat on the climate debate. They\u2019ve both done an astonishing job of getting the climate change back on the public and political agendas. Their warnings of impending apocalypse, disruptive tactics and robust demands that others \u201ctell the truth\u201d about climate change have made huge waves. Parliament has declared a climate emergency. The Guardian has updated its own editorial guidelines to use language that accurately reflects the threat that climate change poses.\nThese demands and promises to tell the truth are based on a core premise: if people knew how bad this was we\u2019d do differently. My organisation studies how we respond to and are shaped by the stories the we hear. I welcome the renewed energy within the climate movement \u2013 and the recognition of the power of language. But I fear we risk underplaying the part of \u201cthe truth\u201d that could set us free.\nMost people in the UK know climate change is a big problem. We understand it poses a grave threat to the future of our world. But we\u2019re not trying to save ourselves \u2013 at least, we\u2019re not trying hard enough.\nCommunications science offers some clues as to why we might be locked in this collective paralysis \u2013 somewhat able to see the problem but unable to deal with it. Our brains are hardwired to jump to conclusions without us noticing we\u2019re doing it. When faced with serious and complex challenges such as climate change, we jump to \u201ccan\u2019t be done\u201d more readily than \u201clet\u2019s work through this problem and see the solutions\u201d. While bleak, \u201cnothing can be done\u201d is a more rewarding conclusion because it\u2019s quicker and easier to think.\nThe tendency to think fatalistically is fuelled by the stories we hear every day. The word \u201ccrisis\u201d appears in our media dozens of times each week, appended to everything from poverty to patisseries, climate change to chick peas. It is background noise. Stating loudly that problems exist and have reached crisis point does not help us to move beyond said crises, especially if they are hard to understand and tough to tackle.\nThe stories we hear and tell matter. They shape how we understand the world and our part within it. Just as hearing migrants described in dehumanising ways flips a switch in our minds and creates automatic negative responses, a steady stream of wholly negative language and ideas creates mental shortcuts to despair and hopelessness.\nResearch is clear that to overcome fatalism and inspire change we must balance talk of urgency with talk of efficacy \u2013 the ability to get a job done. Too little urgency and \u201cwhy bother?\u201d is the default response. Too much crisis and we become overwhelmed, fatalistic or disbelieving \u2013 or a disjointed mixture of all three, which is where most of us get stuck when anyone talks about climate change.\nWe are all swayed by what we think other people think and what we see as normal. In post-war Rwanda a radio soap opera succeeded where other attempts to change relationships and interactions failed. By depicting positive relationships between opposing ethnic groups, the soap made these relationships seem normal and improved dynamics.\nWe need to change what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s perceived to be normal. And at the moment we think, and are constantly told, that most people don\u2019t care enough. And the ones who do care are often not relatable to most people. We\u2019re led to believe that inaction is the norm and that not much can be done. Upping the ante only by doing more to illustrate the scale of inaction and the high stakes doesn\u2019t change this, it compounds it.\nWhen Martin Luther King inspired a nation and the world he led with the dream, not the nightmare. When JFK persuaded the American public to support the Apollo programme he balanced the need to act with the ability to do so: \u201cWe choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.\u201d\nThis is not the story being told about climate change. Instead we\u2019re stuck in a climate disaster movie \u2013 and it\u2019s not even a very good one. The threat is complex and can feel remote, but we\u2019re told the chances of survival are slim. There are constant warnings but few heroes in sight. Our response is predictable: we switch off or we change the channel.\nThe climate story can evolve from its current emphasis on chastisement and detachment. The future of our planet \u2013 and how it is possible to save it \u2013 is a story worth telling. And retelling in ever more interesting and inspiring ways.\nTo help us avoid the worst effects of climate change we need a steady stream of stories that bring to life our capacity to dream big and get things done. We need high doses of creativity and ingenuity from a wide range of different voices. We need stories that show real life \u2013 and real life as it could be. We need to be able to see, feel and taste what we could do if leaders led and hope triumphed.\n\u2022 Nicky Hawkins is a communications strategist for the FrameWorks Institute", "label": 0}, "text-10": {"text": "CHICAGO,\u00a0October 2, 2014 \u2014\u00a0In 1997 during the Kyoto Protocol Treaty negotiations in Japan, Dr. Robert Watson, then Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was asked about scientists who challenge United Nations conclusions that global warming was man-made.

But alongside the smell of popcorn, another scent pervades the cinema: the waft of stale cigarette smoke.\nNow scientists say they have measured levels of such \u201cthirdhand\u201d smoke, suggesting it is carried on the bodies and clothing of moviegoers and could be a prominent, and lingering, source of hazardous chemicals.\n\u201cThis represents significant but poorly understood health risks to non-smokers and a source of reactive chemicals indoors,\u201d said Dr Drew Gentner, co-author of the research from Yale University, noting that previous studies suggest thirdhand smoke may account for between 5% and 60% of the combined disease burden from cigarette smoke in non-smokers.\nWriting in the journal Science Advances, researchers report how they tracked traces of cigarette smoke in a German cinema \u2013 a venue where smoking is not permitted. The cinema was 1,300 sq metres in size, and supplied with fresh, filtered air from outside.\nThe team sampled the exhaust air duct of the cinema for four days and detected 35 volatile substances that are found in tobacco smoke, including formaldehyde and the carcinogenic chemical benzene.\nConcentrations of such substances showed a spike when customers entered the screening. Less pronounced spikes were seen for earlier showtimes, while levels of the substances were lower for family films than for \u201cR-rated\u201d action films aimed at older cinemagoers, despite the latter having smaller audiences.\n\u201cIn the R-rated films, especially the ones that are occurring later in the evening, it appears there\u2019s a greater propensity of people attending those movies to have smoked, or perhaps to have smoked more frequently or more cigarettes, and so they are off-gassing more,\u201d said Gentner.\nAnalysis of particular substances revealed that, in the case of the action films, the thirdhand smoke was relatively \u201cfresh\u201d, while its presence in family films was older \u2013 possibly down to substances lingering from previous screenings.\nThe team found signs that substances from thirdhand smoke build up over time.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because the chemicals don\u2019t remain entirely in the air, but are also absorbed on to various surfaces and furnishings from which they re-enter the air over time,\u201d said Gentner.\nThe researchers also collected samples of fine, airborne particles from the cinema and analysed the substances stuck to them. Among those detected was nicotine.\nThe team said the upshot was that those going to R-rated films were exposed, on average, to the equivalent of secondhand smoke from between one and 10 cigarettes, depending on the substance in question.\nThe study involved audiences of different sizes, and it was not clear which moviegoers had previously been smoking or exposed to smoke. The team did not look at how exposure to thirdhand smoke varied with proximity to a source.\n\u201cThe people in the room will all be exposed to the same number of secondhand smoke equivalents in terms of emissions, but the total mass of the compounds they inhale will change with their proximity to the source,\u201d said Gentner.\nThe team say the study offers a real-life example of exposure, adding that other spaces, which may be smaller with poorer ventilation \u2013 such as bars, offices and underground trains \u2013 could have much higher levels of thirdhand smoke.\nProf John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies and consultant in respiratory medicine at Nottingham University, said the results were not surprising. \u201cThis study confirms what anyone with a sense of smell has already worked out: that smokers carry and emit tobacco smoke components into the atmosphere even when not smoking,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn reality the exposure sustained by others in such circumstances is low, and any health risk likely to be likewise,\u201d he added, although he called for more research into potential impacts.\nOthers said it was not clear whether the levels of thirdhand smoke detected were high enough to cause health problems.\n\u201cIt is a long road \u2026 to showing that there is anything that non-smokers should be concerned about,\u201d said Martin Jarvis, emeritus professor of health psychology at University College London, who was not involved in the research.\nProf Jacqui Hamilton, an expert in aerosol chemistry and air quality from York University noted that, while the detected emissions included hazardous chemicals such as benzene and formaldehyde, some of the most toxic compounds within thirdhand smoke \u2013 tobacco-specific nitrosamines \u2013 were not detected, although it was not clear why. \n\u201cOnly very small levels of exposure to these compounds have the potential to increase cancer risk and future studies could investigate this to understand the full impact of tobacco-related emissions on non-smokers,\u201d Hamilton said.", "label": 0}, "text-12": {"text": "Number of Kiwi coaches at World Cup prompts questions over health of global rugby\nAs the ninth Rugby World Cup approaches, the bookmakers\u2019 odds on a Kiwi getting his hands on the trophy at tournament\u2019s end are small. Perhaps, then, they should frame a market on which Kiwi, given nine of the participants have either Kiwi head coaches or, in the case of England and Tonga, New Zealanders in prominent positions among the back-room staff.\nThrow in an Australian coaching England, Welshmen in charge of Canada, Namibia and Russia, and a South African leading the United States, and 55% of the teams at the tournament are not coached by a native.\nIs that healthy for the global game? Perhaps not. The top intellectual property remains, for now, the domain of the few. The various participants leading other than their native teams are all professionals, and so certainly can\u2019t be blamed for jumping at the opportunity to coach in international rugby.\nThis is especially so among the New Zealanders given their home country is one of the few still holding out on enlisting foreigners. The longevity of the Kiwis in their positions indicates they are meeting expectations.\nGeorgia have continued to build on the promise shown at the last World Cup with the former Southland and Bay of Plenty halfback Milton Haig running a successful programme in Tbilisi. Ditto the under-rated John McKee with Fiji, who have always had the players, but now have an organisational structure and a level of fitness that could have Australia and Wales sweating over the next couple of weeks.\nSuch has been the work of McKee, it is surprising that he is not being touted as a possible Wallabies contender, especially given he has enjoyed success on the domestic scene in Sydney before. That could change if Fiji topple Australia in their opening game.\nFormer North Harbour coach Steve Jackson might have lower aspirations with Samoa, who have won just eight of 20 at the tournament since the second of their quarter-final appearances 24 years ago. Samoa won just one game when in \u201clocal hands\u201d last time.\nJoe Schmidt\u2019s Ireland and Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales are undoubtedly contenders although there\u2019s a fair chance both will have to get past their birth country in order to prevail. Ireland emerged from the recent rankings ping pong rated No 1. Historically, that\u2019s a good place to be: of the four tournaments held since the rankings were introduced in 2003, three have been won by the top-rated side as the competition began.\nOutside of All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, the New Zealander under the most scrutiny is Jamie Joseph, whose Japanese side is the centre of great expectation. The former All Black, who also played for Japan at the 1999 tournament, has fellow Kiwis Tony Brown and Scott Hansen, both of whom are returning to New Zealand next year, alongside him in the coaching box.\nThe trio have had the squad together for a long time, keeping most of the players out of Super Rugby, as they\u2019ve plotted to upset one or both of Scotland and Ireland in order to make the quarter-finals for the first time. It won\u2019t be easy, as last Friday\u2019s 41-7 pummelling by South Africa showed.\nWhile Japanese success would boost the tournament\u2019s standing in the eyes of locals and neutrals, even if they fail, we will no doubt hear, during the next six weeks, plenty of messaging trumpeting the \u201cgrowth\u201d of the game internationally. Global viewership numbers will be quoted, attendance and profit figures too. The game is clearly enjoying expansion in some areas, but its health is questionable when so many of the top international coaching positions are not held by natives.\nCertainly, this reflects the excellence of the New Zealand game, and the desire of others to tap into that knowledge, but is World Rugby inadvertently only adding to the coaching depth of the major players, given it is funding many of the coaches of the second-tier nations out of its development kitty?\nBrown has already been tipped for a post on the All Blacks\u2019 staff next year. Joseph may be headed that way too. Hansen is returning to the Crusaders. McKee is assisted by Tabai Matson and Neil Barnes, both of whom coach in Super Rugby at the Chiefs.\nWhile coaching internationally offers excellent career development for the individuals concerned, how much of that intellectual property gets assimilated into the local game before the \u201chired gun\u201d moves on? How many of the assistant coaches of these teams are locals?\nThis is not a new trend. The seven New Zealand passport holders running campaigns in Japan equals the same number four years ago, and is only one more than in 2011. Wales have had a Kiwi in charge of their national side at five of the last six tournaments, and will replace the incumbent with another next year, making it something of an irony that three Welsh head coaches will still be involved at this World Cup.\nSignificantly, many of the Kiwi expats oversee major nations.

They also include accidents and suicides involving drugs, and complications such as deep vein thrombosis or septicaemia arising from intravenous drug use.\nAround two-thirds of the deaths reported, or 2,917, were from drug misuse, continuing a trend seen over the last decade.\nMales accounted for more than two-thirds of drug poisonings, or 2,984, and females 1,375 .\nEighty per cent of the deaths recorded among males and 67% among females were the result of accidental poisoning. The figures for intentional self-poisoning were 16% and 30% respectively.\nThe north-east registered 96.3 deaths per million people, compared with 39.4 in London, where the rate was lowest. The figures for Wales, the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber were also high.\nRelease, which provides specialist advice and information to the public and professionals on issues related to drug use and laws, urged the government to declare a national emergency.\nThe charity\u2019s executive director, Niamh Eastwood, said: \u201cPeople are dying and government inaction is contributing to these deaths. For the last seven years we have seen drug-related deaths increase year on year and every year we have called on the government to take action, to scale up funding for drug treatment, to support overdose prevention sites, to fund drug checking facilities, and to expand heroin assisted treatment.\n\u201cEach year they have ignored us, continuing to do the same whilst people die. If the home secretary and the prime minister continue to ignore these calls then they will continue to be responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year.\u201d\nIn Scotland, a debate over the use of drug consumption rooms \u2013 supervised facilities where illicit drugs can be used under the supervision of trained staff \u2013 is ongoing with Glasgow MPs of all parties pressing the UK government to allow them in the city.\nScotland\u2019s drug-related death toll increased by 27% over the past year to reach a record high of 1,187, according to data released in July, putting the country on a par with the US in per capita terms.\nThe Scottish government has renewed calls for more powers to be devolved to Holyrood which it believes will allow it to take measures that would reduce the number of fatalities.\nDr James Nicholls, the chief executive of Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said: \u201cCurrent policy is not protecting people or their communities. Instead it is blocking measures we know can save lives, while decimating treatment funding. People dependent on drugs don\u2019t die from overdoses in supervised drug consumption rooms or heroin prescribing clinics. We need these approaches to be supported and funded in the UK.\u201d\nShirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: \u201cThis latest rise in drug deaths is further confirmation that our policy-makers do not have the best interests of people dependent on drugs in mind, or those of the communities around them.

But has has offered no detail on how, other than to point to Snowy Hydro 2.0, a project close to his predecessor\u2019s heart.\nThe Neg also laid bare the deep fissures in the Coalition between the pragmatic centre and the right wing, which Turnbull tried to bridge for three years but in vain.\nThe well-educated voters of Wentworth, who might once have felt reassured that Turnbull would prevail, now see that the party that they have supported for 60 years is not the moderate \u201csmall l\u201d Liberal party they voted for. \nWentworth is a trial run for tactics for the election next year\nAdd in a drought in Australia, record-breaking storms in the US and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warning that the world faces a catastrophe without urgent action on climate change to peg global warming to 1.5%, and it\u2019s no wonder the issue has become, perhaps, the defining factor in the Wentworth byelection.\nGetUp\u2019s climate campaigner, Miriam Lyons, says it\u2019s not just Wentworth; climate change is now as big an issue as it was in the 2007 election campaign.\nThat does not bode well for the Coalition at the next election.\nConverting that unhappiness over climate change into a vote for someone else has been the subject of an intense, co-ordinated campaign in Wentworth.\nA coalition of environmental groups has been working together in the electorate to ensure that voters realise they have an opportunity to send a message on climate change.\nThe ScoMos, with lumps of coal, and the Tony Abbotts in their budgie smugglers outside candidate events are just the most visible parts of their efforts.\nGetUp has organised an army of phone banking volunteers who have called more than 85,000 of Wentworth\u2019s 103,000 registered voters.\n\u201cAfter the IPCC report came out and Scott Morrison said it didn\u2019t apply to Australia, one man walked into our office and said: \u2018what can I do?\u2019. He\u2019s one of our phone banking volunteers now,\u201d Lyons says.\nOver the past few days, volunteers have swelled to more than 100 each night.\nGetUp will have literally hundreds of volunteers at polling places handing out cards that explain how to cast your vote for the environment. It gives four options: Greens, the independents Kerryn Phelps and Licia Heath, and Labor.\nBut in a controversial move, it has changed the Greens\u2019 recommendation on preferences, instead advocating a preference for Phelps ahead of Labor\u2019s Tim Murray.\nThe former Greens leader Bob Brown has also recommended putting Phelps ahead of Murray after voting 1 Greens, in a pragmatic recognition that there is a greater chance of the Liberals being defeated if she comes ahead of Murray.\nLyons says GetUp\u2019s decision on who to recommend and how to preference is based on candidate responses to surveys and a scoring process that evaluates each candidate on their promises on climate policy, and other progressive issues such as ending offshore detention. Phelps has said she opposes the giant Adani mine, while the ALP supports it, although Murray has said he will work to halt it.\nSeveral green groups also organised a candidate forum at Bondi Pavilion, which was attended by 300 people. But it received good national exposure, thanks to speakers from the conservative side of politics \u2013 John Hewson and Geoff Cousins, who were joined by coral expert Professor Terry Hughes.\nHewson, a former Liberal leader, has urged voters concerned with climate change to vote against the Liberals.\n\u201cThe idea was to maximise turnout by getting more conservative voices to lead with the message: \u2018its OK to put climate change as the top priority in deciding how to vote\u2019,\u201d says Gavan McFadzean, the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s (ACF) climate campaigner.\nHewson\u2019s intervention seems to have been a turning point, aided by Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s son, Alex Turnbull, who has used his Twitter account and media interviews to advocate for a protest vote against the party his father once led.\nHe says he\u2019s doing it because climate change is the most important issue, and while he appears to have acted off his own bat, it has certainly helped underline the climate policy void on the conservative side of politics.\nThe ACF does not issue how-to-vote cards, but has sent its 5,000 supporters in Wentworth a scorecard rating each candidate on their environmental policies and has asked them to talk to their friends and family about the issues.\nThe advertising has also been more conventional, and the ACF has been running advertisements about climate change and drought in local cinemas, while GetUp has crowd-sourced funds for mobile billboards that have become regular features on the streets of Wentworth.\nThe ACF has also produced electorate-specific data on what climate change will mean for that community. It plans to replicate the work, by the Australian National University, for more electorates during the the general election.\nWentworth is proving a useful test bed for strategies the environmental groups plan to use next year.\n\u201cWentworth is a trial run for tactics for the election next year,\u201d McFadzean says. \u201cThe main challenge will be to keep climate as an issue through the UN Conference of Parties meeting in Poland and into next year.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-16": {"text": "new book explains how u.n. ipcc tricked world into the mirage of \u2018global warming\u2018\nThis post is a lengthy review by Prof Cliff Ollier, of the School of Earth and Environment at University of Western Australia, of a new book by H.T.

Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.\nOcean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen.\nBy the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,\u201d said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature.\nWhat appears to happen, according to the study\u2019s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse.\nThe authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005.\nThen they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.\n Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2020/04/08/melting-glacier--trimmed.mp3 \n\u201cDespite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn\u2019t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one \u2013 or a few \u2013 snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,\u201d Pigot explained.\n\u201cIn our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.\u201d\nThe scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an \u201cabrupt exposure event\u201d, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage.\nBut at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures.\nThat means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt.\n\u201cIt is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,\u201d said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study.\n\u201cOur research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.\u201d\nScientists have known for years about the likely existence of \u201ctipping points\u201d in the world\u2019s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting.\nThis new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating.\nMark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: \u201cThere is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\u201cThe world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency.

Elections show most voters in the United States agree with Pruitt, too. His summary of the situation is absolutely correct.\nLiberal pundits \u2014 most of whom never took a science course in their life (or, like Al Gore, flunked the one course they did take) \u2014 dismiss anyone who dissents from their forecasts of environmental catastrophes as ignorant \u201cclimate change deniers.\u201d They have it exactly backwards: Climate change skeptics understand the science far better than the alarmists. It\u2019s why they are skeptical.\n\u201cWe know that humans have most flourished during times of\u2026 warming trends,\u201d Pruitt also said, adding, \u201cI think there\u2019s assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing.\u201d\nAgain, this is absolutely correct. Historically, warmer periods have been accompanied by higher crop yields and rates of population growth, rising prosperity, and even less conflict and fewer wars. Cold periods or periods with falling temperatures, in contrast, are often accompanied by extreme weather, crop failures, starvation, and armed conflicts.\nEnvironmentalists either know \u201cwarmer is better\u201d and seek to hide this inconvenient truth from the public, or the only research they\u2019ve done is reading the fundraising letters of silly alarmist groups such as Greenpeace and Union of Concerned Scientists. They need to get up to speed on this issue before they claim moral and intellectual superiority over climate change \u201cdeniers.\u201d\nAdministrator Pruitt then hit a whopping home run when he asked, \u201cDo we really know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100 in the year 2018?\u201d The obvious answer is \u201cof course not.\u201d Why assume today\u2019s temperature is ideal or magically perfect when we know human populations (and wildlife) have flourished in other, often warmer conditions? This answer blows away all the groundless speculation about the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d and what ought to be done today to affect the weather a century from now.\nPruitt\u2019s interview demonstrates he is the best EPA administrator the agency has ever had, and arguably the best cabinet pick President Donald Trump has made in his still-young administration. That Pruitt has the courage to confront environmental activists regarding their lies and misinformation on this key issue is a gift to all the \u201cforgotten Americans\u201d who voted for Donald Trump for president.\nKeep it up, Mr. Pruitt!

As chairman I was taken a little bit aback,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere was some strong resistance on the call from Pacific Island leaders for more concrete works to reduce greenhouse gases, but to particularly cut down and stop new coalmines in Australia,\u201d said Sopoaga.\nThroughout the forum Scott Morrison repeatedly spoke of the evident impact of climate change on Tuvalu, but said Australia was a good international partner on climate change and was on track to reduce its emissions in line with Paris targets.\nThe ABC filmed the episode at the University of South Pacific in Fiji\u2019s capital of Suva earlier on Monday, the first time Q&A has been filmed in the Pacific, and one of the few times the program has been filmed outside Australia.\nThe episode was dominated by the climate emergency, as Pacific leaders spoke of the impact on their nations and challenged Australia on its response.\nIn response to a question about the impact of the climate crisis on low-lying islands like his own nation of Tuvalu, Sopoaga said: \u201cIf the world doesn\u2019t reduce emissions as called for by the IPCC special report \u2026 we will face the situation where island countries like Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and others will be submerged into the sea by 2060, this is a scary scenario and it is very, very serious.\n\u201cI certainly hope that not only the Pacific, but those that have polluted the atmosphere and caused global warming will come to react and do the right thing in response to the special report.\u201d\nVirisila Buadromo, an advocate for women\u2019s and human rights in Fiji, urged Australia to take more action.\n\u201cI think Australia, as the largest country in the region, the richest country in the region, as well as, you also happen to be the largest emitter of carbon in the region, I think that it\u2019s important that if you are part of our family, you need to stand with our family \u2026 to fight against climate change.\u201d\nI\u2019m Australian.

Why isn\u2019t the Australian government taking stronger action on climate change? #QandA pic.twitter.com/trcset6I2E\nAlex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, defended Australia\u2019s record in this area.\n\u201cAustralia does do a lot on climate change internationally and here in the Pacific as well and we take it very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet our targets in Paris, we\u2019ve met our targets in Kyoto, we\u2019re going to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030 on our 2005 levels, this year we\u2019ll have about 20% of our power generated by renewables and we hope that to be a third by 2020.\u201d\nWhile the Fijian attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, was more diplomatic towards Australia, saying that Fiji recognised countries had their own political and economic imperatives, he added: \u201cWe need first of all everyone to recognise that actually coalmining is detrimental to the environment, creates climate events and then we need to have a game plan, the game plan is to have a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.\u201d\nThe conversation also touched on illegal fishing; the increased rates of hard drug use and addiction in the Pacific, which is used as a transit point for drugs trafficked to Australia; the influence of China in the region; and the outbreak of measles, which has particularly devastated Samoa, killing 53 people.\nOn China, Alex Hawke said Australia was happy to work with any international partners in the region who had the Pacific\u2019s best interest at heart, and that Australia wasn\u2019t threatened by China\u2019s presence as long as China was focusing on things like health and education and the region\u2019s economic prosperity. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at the region through a geo-strategic lens,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is the Pacific\u2019s time, there\u2019s certainly a lot of interest in the Pacific and we do have to take account, as a united people in this region, of how to use this time to do better for people in the Pacific, but that doesn\u2019t mean compromising values and sovereignty and I think that\u2019s sometimes where there\u2019s a difference in behaviour. I think people in the Pacific are very savvy people about working out who is coming into the region with their agenda in mind, their priorities in mind versus what\u2019s good for the Pacific countries.\u201d\nThe panel was also asked by an audience member about violence against women. The Pacific has the highest rates of violence against women in the world.\nTony Jones threw the question to Buadromo, who quipped: \u201cBecause I\u2019m the feminist and I work in women\u2019s rights the assumption is I\u2019m the one who should be combatting violence against women?\u201d \nHow can we overcome the traditional expectations of women\u2019s \u201csubmissiveness\u201d as a factor in growing cases of violence against women? 1/2 #QandA pic.twitter.com/RzybWhRCUq\nShe later took Fiji\u2019s attorney general to task, interrupting him as he outlined his government\u2019s record on domestic violence, saying while legislation now existed to punish perpetrators, that did not stop violence before it happened.\n\u201cThere is a psyche that is perpetuated by your government, your prime minister has perpetuated this psyche where violence is OK, because as we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, in the last year there have been repeated incidents of people being beaten up by security forces,\u201d she said.\n Jones ended the program with a joke at Hawke\u2019s expense, as the minister thanked the ABC for hosting the program in Fiji and said he hoped to see much more of the ABC in the region, with Jones saying: \u201cGive us the funds and we\u2019ll be back.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-21": {"text": "MP Bridgen enters Covid-19 row between wife and Dorries\nThe MP Andrew Bridgen has waded into an online row between his wife and the health minister Nadine Dorries over how the latter dealt with her coronavirus diagnosis.\nBridgen has a cold and a cough and claims he sat next to Dorries, who has been diagnosed with the illness, in a tearoom in Westminster.\nNevena Bridgen, an opera singer, claimed online on Friday morning that Dorries had jeopardised her family\u2019s health by not mentioning him to Public Health England (PHE) staff who were tracing people with whom she had had contact before her diagnosis.\nIn response, Dorries said she had not been sitting anywhere near Bridgen but had advised him that if he was worried he should call 111.\nBridgen told the Guardian: \u201cI can assure you that Nadine Dorries came and sat next to me at the end of my table.

In future they will focus on the most vulnerable families \u2013 with nurses, who health visitors say have not had the same training, taking on the other three checks.\nHealth visitors help parents tackle childhood obesity, prepare for their baby to have its childhood vaccinations and ensure that infants bond with their mother and father in the crucial early months.\nThe proposal has triggered a backlash. Local Conservative MPs are warning that \u201cdismantling\u201d Suffolk\u2019s health visiting service will reduce the advice and support that parents receive to help them negotiate the challenges of having a baby. MPs including Jo Churchill and Dr Dan Poulter intend to question council leader Matthew Hicks about the plans at a meeting on 5 July.\nIt is disappointing to see councils like Suffolk dismantling a service so important to new families\nThe documents reveal that north-east Ipswich and coastal Suffolk are due to lose 14 full-time equivalent health visitor posts, and south and west Ipswich 7 posts, because the council has decided to cut the budget of its 0-19 Healthy Child Service by 10%, which is about \u00a31m.\nPoulter, who served as a health minister in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, said: \u201cHaving worked hard as a health minister to personally oversee the rebuilding of the health visitor workforce, and increase health visitor numbers by over 4,000 between 2012 and 2015, it is disappointing to see councils like Suffolk dismantling a service that is so important to new families.\u201d\nThe Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, recently warned that health visitor numbers had fallen so much since 2015 \u2013 to about 8,000 \u2013 that services for \u201cour youngest generation\u201d were at risk.\nRetirements, health visitors leaving to do other jobs and a lack of new recruits meant the residual workforce was \u201cbeing stretched to its limits\u201d, it said.\nYear-on-year Whitehall cuts to public health budgets is leading to councils reducing sexual health and drug and alcohol addiction services, Poulter added. \u201cSadly, it looks as though health visiting services and the families they care for are now also suffering.\u201d He urged ministers to amend the Health and Social Care Act 2012 so that the NHS regains responsibility for public health.\nOne Suffolk health visitor said: \u201cWe\u2019re all feeling very angry and very demoralised by the council\u2019s decision.

According to the Australian conservative climate-change denier Andrew Bolt, she is \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d, \u201cfreakishly influential\u201d and \u201cstrange\u201d. In a nasty, brutish and short tweet, the former Ukip funder, Arron Banks, simply said, \u201cFreak yachting accidents do happen in August \u2026\u201d Controversialist columnist Brendan O\u2019Neill wrote that there was \u201csomething chilling\u201d about Thunberg, who \u201cincreasingly looks and sounds like a cult member\u201d.\nThe attacks on Thunberg look like a kind of displacement activity rooted in fear that what she says might be true\nWe live in such venomous times that these levels of vitriol are disturbingly common. But it is not at all normal to level such personal attacks at a 16-year-old with multiple mental health issues campaigning to make the world a better place. Banks\u2019s protest that \u201cyou lefties have no sense of humour\u201d is as shabby as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201clocker-room banter\u201d defence of his flagrant misogyny. O\u2019Neill says Thunberg is a \u201cpoor young woman\u201d whose transformation by others into a \u201cmessiah\u201d is \u201cunforgivable\u201d, as though that makes his descriptions of her \u201cmonotone voice\u201d and \u201clook of apocalyptic dread\u201d nothing personal.\nThe ferocity of the attacks demands an explanation, but it also raises questions for those who have built up her up and inadvertently helped make her a target.\nShooting the messenger is, of course, a tried and tested way of dealing with bad news. The case that the anthropogenic climate crisis is real and urgent is now so strong that it\u2019s pretty much the only tactic left for those who refuse to accept it.\nThunberg is a particularly tempting target. Bolt made much of the fact that she is \u201csomeone with disorders which intensify fears\u201d. This is deeply reassuring for people who think anyone who is afraid for the future of the planet is overreacting. \u201cEco-anxiety\u201d can be dismissed as a pathology rather than as a rational response to a growing emergency.\nThunberg has become exhibit A for those like O\u2019Neill who want to rebrand the environmental cause as \u201cclimate-change alarmism\u201d. They see in Thunberg someone who makes this dismissive charge seem plausible. Why try to criticise thousands of sober, grownup scientists when you can have a go at a pig-tailed Young Turk instead?\nYou wonder about the psychological motivations of those who have set upon Thunberg so thuggishly. It looks like a kind of displacement activity rooted in fear that what she says might be true. Instead of engaging with the argument they wrestle with the arguer. Such speculation is tempting but it\u2019s ultimately beside the point. Getting personal is a sure sign you\u2019re losing the argument so we should not get personal back. Whatever their motives, their actions betray a moral and intellectual bankruptcy.\nHowever, the uncomfortable question for Thunberg\u2019s supporters is whether their virtual canonisation of her has presented a gift to their opponents. Making a young and idealistic teenager the figurehead of a movement makes it too easy to dismiss the campaign as a whole as naive and idealistic. Indeed, the commentator Christopher Caldwell, who is supportive of the cause, worries that the rallying around Thunberg reflects a refusal to engage with complexity. \u201cPeople have had enough of balance and perspective,\u201d he wrote in the New York Times, \u201cThey want single-minded devotion to the task at hand.\u201d That is exactly what Thunberg has come to represent.\nThe French philosopher Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven hinted at another problem in a Delphic tweet in which he called her \u201can anti-product product\u201d that we use to buy virtue with our support and retweets without actually having to do anything ourselves. Many of those who ostentatiously bid her bon voyage across the Atlantic are hardly strangers to airports. \u201cWhen you consume Greta, you do not help the planet,\u201d wrote Enthoven. \u201cYou play the game of the system that destroys it.\u201d\nSanctification also makes reasonable disagreement from people on her side more difficult. Most notably Thunberg has frequently framed the issue as an intergenerational conflict. \u201cYoung people must hold older generations accountable for the mess they have created,\u201d she tweeted last December. \u201cWe need to get angry, and transform that anger into action.\u201d\nMany older people resent being blamed for the climate crisis. Even if you agree that we should take our share of responsibility, what matters most now is clearing up the mess, not squabbling over who caused it.\nThunberg herself should not be blamed for the way in which she has been built up into something bigger than any person can be. On this, she and her fellow campaigners have been more clear-sighted than their adult fans. Before heading to the UN she said of leaders such as Trump that \u201cinstead of speaking to me and the school-striking children and teenagers they should be talking to actual scientists and experts in this area\u201d. Mai Sheehan, a 16-year-old fellow activist from Ireland, told the FT that Thunberg \u201chas always been very specific that she is not the leader\u201d and that \u201call our decisions are made on a consensus basis\u201d.\nThunberg has been clearer than anyone that it is a mistake to place too much attention on her. \u201cI think there is a lot of focus on me as an individual and not on the climate itself,\u201d she told the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. \u201cI think we should focus more on the climate issue because this is not about me.\u201d\nThunberg has done infinitely more in a few short years to improve humanity\u2019s prospects than I have done or will do in a lifetime. Lionising her doesn\u2019t help the cause. But the excessive zealotry of some of her supporters is a trifling fault compared to the egregious attacks by critics who would rather take her on than the inconvenient truths she brings.\n\u2022 Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher", "label": 0}, "text-26": {"text": "Kebabs and rock music: Moscow's ruse for luring the young away from politics\nOnce there were bread and circuses.

Organisers claim that they attracted 305,000 visitors, a widely disputed total that would make the last-minute cookout one-and-a-half times larger than Glastonbury.\nThe parties are part of a broad and energetic effort by Russia\u2019s government to deflate protests against the disqualification of independent candidates in Moscow\u2019s municipal elections.\nSince the recent round of protests began police have detained more than 2,000 people, charged 11 with rioting, opened a money laundering case against anti-corruption researchers, threatened a family with taking away their infant son, reviewed the debt and military service records of protesters and made liberal use of batons in preserving the peace.\nBut the so-called \u201cspoiler festivals\u201d are also indicative of a government unlikely to make concessions and focused instead on tactics to win over young people and those sceptical of the protests.\n\u201cIt is an attempt to distract people with a festival, a positive spectacle,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, a political scientist. \u201cThe opposition may believe it is stupid, and of course there were not 300,000 people last week, but there are many people in Moscow who are neutral or negative to the protests. This is an appeal to them.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete denial of the reasons for the conflict behind the protests,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe government is acting as if there is no problem at all.\u201d\nDays before last week\u2019s protests, when 1,000 people were detained and mobile internet was shut down over much of central Moscow, the city announced a kebab and rock festival for Gorky Park.\nIt did not go smoothly. Several of the musical acts slated to play at Shashlik Live said they had been included in the lineup without their permission, and turned down the bookings because it conflicted with the protest.\nStill, pro-government figures used the crowd numbers to disparage the protests.\n\u201c100 more times people [went to Shashlik Live], than the protests,\u201d wrote Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the state-funded RT. \u201cWhich leads to the conclusion that just like 20 years ago, the noise in the political internets has nothing to do with reality.\u201d\nRussian bloggers quickly noted that the numbers exceeded even large music festivals like Coachella, Glastonbury, and Russia\u2019s Nashestviye.\nIlya Varlamov, a blogger-turned-businessman who often covers urban issues, noted that the Moscow government regularly inflates attendance figures at its events, including a burger festival that supposedly attracted 570,000 people.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just not trust the official site of the mayor and Margarita Simonyan,\u201d he wrote in an acerbic blog post after last week\u2019s protests. \u201cSo I suggest that we just congratulate Moscow with its success. It\u2019s not every day that shashlik, jam and burgers can gather more people together than Jimi Hendrix at the height of his fame.\u201d\nThe tactic of alternative programming was used during the 2011-12 protests, when the government set up pro-Putin rallies, Stanovaya noted. Attendance could top 150,000 at those events, exceeding the size of anti-Putin protests, although some supporters were bussed in.\nBut in the new Moscow, pro-Putin rallies are unlikely to return. Instead, Kremlin figures have sought to challenge young political energies toward social activism and the opposition protest this weekend will be recognised by the city. But, late in negotiations, the city told opposition members they would not be allowed to have music during the event.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want it to be a celebration,\u201d Stanovaya said.

She caused a minor stir in 2008 when she attended a speech by her brother in parliament wearing jeans and a blouse, eschewing the traditional sari that most women in the chamber wear.\nBut Ghose said the next months would also be an unprecedented test of Gandhi\u2019s political skills. \u201cSo far she\u2019s been able to just dip her toe in politics and then come out of it and go on holidays,\u201d Ghose said. \u201cNow she has actually taken the plunge and will really have to prove herself.\u201d\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) is likely to use the appointment to sharpen its attack on Congress as a party of nepotism. Modi told party workers after the announcement that for Congress, a family was the party, unlike the BJP, for which the party was family.\n\u201cThe Congress has basically publicly announced that Rahul Gandhi has failed and needs crutches from within the family,\u201d said BJP spokesman Sambit Patra.\nHe said the announcement was intended to boost party morale after the Congress party appeared to be sidelined from an alliance of opposition parties that has formed in recent weeks to take on Modi. \u201cBecause of his rejection by grand alliance parties, he has opted for a family alliance,\u201d Patra said.\nGandhi\u2019s husband, Robert Vadra, has also been accused of engaging in corrupt land deals by political opponents, allegations he says are baseless but which could be given a fresh airing after Wednesday\u2019s announcement.\nModi enters India\u2019s election season appearing as weak as he has ever been while in power after losing three state elections in December and amid wide discontent with an economy that is growing quickly but failing to create enough good jobs to match the aspirations of a young and restless country.\nBut his personal popularity is still thought to be high and no other figure, either within his party or among his opponents, has emerged as a strong alternative leader.", "label": 0}, "text-28": {"text": "Immediate fossil fuel phaseout could arrest climate change \u2013 study\nClimate change could be kept in check if a phaseout of all fossil fuel infrastructure were to begin immediately, according to research.\nIt shows that meeting the internationally agreed aspiration of keeping global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is still possible. The scientists say it is therefore the choices being made by global society, not physics, which is the obstacle to meeting the goal.\nThe study found that if all fossil fuel infrastructure \u2013 power plants, factories, vehicles, ships and planes \u2013 from now on are replaced by zero-carbon alternatives at the end of their useful lives, there is a 64% chance of staying under 1.5C.\nIn October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the difference between 1.5C of warming and the earlier international target of 2C was a significantly lower risk of drought, floods, heatwaves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\nChristopher Smith, of the University of Leeds, who led the research, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news from a geophysical point of view. But on the other side of the coin, the [immediate fossil fuel phaseout] is really at the limit of what we could we possibly do. We are basically saying we can\u2019t build anything now that emits fossil fuels.\u201d\nNicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics, who was not part of the research team, said: \u201cWe are rapidly approaching the end of the age of fossil fuels. This study confirms that all new energy infrastructure must be sustainable from now on if we are to avoid locking in commitments to emissions that would lead to the world exceeding the goals of the Paris agreement.\u201d \nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, used computer models to estimate by how much global temperatures would rise if a fossil fuel infrastructure phaseout began immediately. The lifespan for power plants was set at 40 years, cars an average of 15 years and planes 26 years. The work also assumes a rapid end to beef and dairy consumption, which is responsible for significant global emissions.\nIn this scenario, the models suggest carbon emissions would decline to zero over the next four decades and there would be a 66% chance of the global temperature rise remaining below 1.5C. If the phaseout does not begin until 2030, the chance is 33%.\nThe analysis did not include the possibility of tipping points such as the sudden release of huge volumes of methane from permafrost, which could spark runaway global warming.\nThe scientists accept their scenario is at the extreme end of ambition, but said it was important to know that meeting the 1.5C target was still physically possible and dependent on the choices made now and in the coming years. \u201cThe climate system is not stopping you [hitting the target], global society is stopping you,\u201d Smith said.\nOther work, using a different approach, has also shown that keeping within the 1.5C limit is possible if radical action is taken immediately. In some sectors, zero-carbon technology already exists, such as renewable energy. But in others, such as aviation, it does not. \u201cMaybe the solution here is flying less,\u201d Smith said.\nProf Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, who also was not part of the research team, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s drilling a new gas well, keeping an old coal power station open, or even buying a diesel car, the choices we make today will largely determine the climate pathways of tomorrow. The message of this new study is loud and clear: act now or see the last chance for a safer climate future ebb away.\u201d\nSmith\u2019s personal belief is that global heating will surpass 1.5C. \u201cWe are going the right way, but I don\u2019t think we will do enough, quickly enough. I think we are heading for 2C to 2.5C.\u201d\nBut he added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a goal, you are not going to get anywhere. If you have a target that is really hard to achieve and you miss it slightly, that is better than wandering aimlessly into a future climate that is no good for anybody.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-29": {"text": "Review of The Climate Chronicles: Inconvenient Revelations You Won\u2019t Hear From Al Gore\u2014and Others, by Joe Bastardi (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, January 1, 2018), 222 pages, ISBN-10: 1984371401; ISBN-13: 978-1984371409; $14.95 on Amazon.\nPerhaps broadcaster Sean Hannity described Joe Bastardi\u2019s new book best in his jacket blurb: \u201cJoe Bastardi\u2019s love for the weather and climate drove him to write The Climate Chronicles, an expos\u00e9 of the true climate change agenda.\u201d\nNever has this reviewer read a book whose author was more passionate about his subject.\nGenerous Criticism\nBastardi provides readers a short course on weather forecasting in terms anyone can understand. In the process, he uses global warming alarmists\u2019 own words to refute their claims humans are destroying the earth, yet does so in a kind way.\nFor example, Bastardi, who has read everything Pennsylvania State University researcher Michael Mann has written, expresses pity for Mann for having tied his career to a lie he can no longer walk back. Mann is primarily responsible for the highly controversial \u2018hockey stick\u2019 representation of recent climate temperatures.\nBastardi also analyzes Bill McKibben\u2019s tweets from 350.org to teach the reader about weather while gently showing McKibben\u2019s total lack of understanding of it. McKibben founded the anti-fossil fuel organization, 350.org.\nBastardi makes a living forecasting weather for people and companies whose economic viability can depend on accurate forecasts. His reputation and livelihood are on the line every day. As Bastardi shows, New York City could have avoided immense damage had Mayor Michael Bloomberg listened to Bastardi\u2019s urgent reports five days before Hurricane Sandy.\nPower Versus Truth\nBastardi writes not to change the world but to defend science against an ongoing assault. His goal is always truth.\nBastardi suggests the goals driving climate alarmists involve money, self-esteem, power, control, or all of the above, and not necessarily in that order, while noting alarmists are never held accountable for their decades of incorrect predictions of environmental doomsday.\nWhen disaster fails to materialize as climate alarmists predicted, they say it was a timing error and move on to prophesy another upcoming catastrophe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a great strategy because there\u2019s always going to be some location on the earth where some kind of extreme is occurring\u2014though, in most places, the weather is tranquil the majority of the time,\u201d Bastardi writes. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t, there wouldn\u2019t be so many people on the planet, which I suspect is another agenda that drives all this.\n\u201cSimply find a place where a rare event is occurring, then blast headlines that claim it\u2019s because man is destroying the planet,\u201d writes Bastardi.\nFour Key Questions\nBastardi asks four questions at the beginning of the book. Does the Sun have a far greater effect on climate than carbon dioxide? Do the cycles of currents in the ocean, where a vast amount of the Earth\u2019s heat is stored, have a far greater effect on climate than carbon dioxide? Do stochastic events (such as volcanoes) have a far greater effect on the climate than carbon dioxide? Does the very design of the climate system have a far greater effect on the climate than carbon dioxide?\nBastardi patiently and clearly explains why the answer to each question is \u201cyes.\u201d To believe in anthropogenic global warming, you have to believe an increase of one molecule of carbon dioxide out of every 10,000 molecules of air over a 100 year period is now controlling the earth\u2019s climate for the first time in known history, Bastardi shows.\nBastardi exposes a variety of real evildoers as mega-social engineers not truly concerned about the environment. He cites, for example, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change until 2016, who openly stated in 2015 the UN\u2019s goal was to overturn market capitalism: in her words, \u201cto change the economic development model that has been reigning for the, at least, 150 years since the industrial revolution.\u201d\nDrawing on Literature, History\nBastardi is a consummate scholar, drawing frequently from such varied sources as Shakespeare, Robert Burns, H. L. Mencken, and President Dwight Eisenhower to make relevant points about politics and human nature. Bastardi presents a four-page parody of Marc Antony\u2019s Act 3, Scene 2 soliloquy from Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar, in which Antony scolds \u201cclimatologist\u201d Caesar for ignoring the threat of global warming. This hilarious segment alone is easily worth the price of the book.\nBastardi expresses his deep disquiet at the decline of scholarly purity on the part of so many scientists, who he says are foregoing the noble quest for knowledge and truth in the pursuit of fame, fortune, and power. Bastardi notes President Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed similar concerns in his farewell address. Famously warning of a looming military/industrial complex, Eisenhower expressed his additional concern about government\u2019s influence on scientific research, stating the nation must be on guard against the rise of a scientific-technological elite.\n\u201cThe prospect of domination of the nation\u2019s scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever-present and is gravely to be regarded,\u201d Eisenhower said. \u201cYet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\u201d\nThe Climate Chronicles is a uniquely educational and entertaining book, well worth the time to read and enjoy.\nJay Lehr, Ph.D. (jlehr@heartland.org)\u00a0is science director of The Heartland Institute.", "label": 1}, "text-30": {"text": "'It changed my whole outlook': how police scheme changed one offender's life\nSamantha Raw shifts uncomfortably in an airless room inside Bishop Auckland police station. More than a year has passed since the night she describes as \u201cthe worst mistake of my life\u201d, and recalling what happened brings it back into focus.\nRaw had returned home from a night out with her partner when she went upstairs and kissed her four children on the head. Instead of settling in for the night, she got into her car.\nBarely off her driveway, Raw collided with a parked car and flipped her seven-seater on its side. She had to be freed from the car with the help of neighbours and it was not long before the police arrived.\nThe 30-year-old, from a small village in County Durham, was arrested for drink-driving and taken to hospital. It was, she said, the first time she had been in trouble with the police. When she arrived at Bishop Auckland police station, the full consequences of her actions became clear: her children faced being taken into care because she left them in the house, even if only for a few minutes.\nInstead of prosecuting her through the courts, Durham constabulary enrolled Raw in its pioneering rehabilitation programme, Checkpoint. She signed a four-month contract, promised not to reoffend and signed up to support classes on employment and training, relationships advice and \u201cconsequential thinking\u201d \u2013 the everyday decision-making with which 84% of offenders on Checkpoint struggle.\nRaw got a 17-month driving ban but successfully completed the programme in February last year and believes it changed her life. \u201cIf I lost my kids, I don\u2019t know what would happen. I live for them. I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without them,\u201d she said.\nCheckpoint was willing to give people a chance, she said. \u201cThey see this person has made a mistake. I made the first mistake I\u2019d made, ever. They saw that I was willing to work with them and it changed my whole outlook on life.\u201d\nAs part of her rehabilitation, Raw was shown footage from body-worn cameras of the moment police arrived at her upturned vehicle: \u201cI cried because that\u2019s not me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a shock to see what happened around me. It was \u2026 bad.\u201d\nRaw is one of 2,660 offenders to have completed Checkpoint to date, most of them having been arrested for violence, theft or criminal damage. Of that 2,660, 84% have received help for \u201cconsequential thinking\u201d; more than two-thirds have received mental health support; 58% have been supported for alcohol dependency and 38% for drugs.\nDI Andrew Crowe, who set up the initiative, strongly believes it reduces crime and is more cost-effective, more efficient and actually tougher on criminals than dragging them through the courts. \u201cThe fact the police are holding you to account for four months is far more onerous than going to court, pleading guilty, someone speaking on your behalf, then leaving court with a fine,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "text-31": {"text": "How baseless fears over 5G rollout created a health scare\nWhen Tonia Antoniazzi stood up in the House of Commons to talk about the risks of 5G, she admitted that \u201cinitiating a conversation \u2026 has had members of my own team and family telling me that it is all made up.\u201d But the Labour MP was undeterred, securing a debate in parliament and the support of a handful of Labour and SNP colleagues to ask about the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the latest upgrade to the nation\u2019s mobile phone network.\nThe government\u2019s response \u2013 that there was no evidence of any risk, and that it anticipated \u201cno negative effects on public health\u201d \u2013 was, Antoniazzi said, \u201cfar from reassuring\u201d.\nJunk science is a fact of life. Between hyperbolic reporting of careful studies, careful reporting of hyperbolic studies and \u201ccommon sense\u201d dismissal of any studies at all, it is getting harder and harder for non-experts to separate reasonable concerns from medical misinformation.\nSo as Britain\u2019s carriers lined up to launch their 5G networks this summer, they were expecting some resistance. Fears over the health effects of mobile telephony are widespread, ranging from fairly limited concerns about potential long-term risks of living or growing up in close proximity to masts, to claims of full-blown \u201celectromagnetic sensitivity\u201d, which supposedly manifests as a plethora of symptoms from headaches to immunodeficiencies.\n5G is the next generation mobile phone network and it promises much higher connection speeds, lower latency (response times) and to be more reliable than the creaking\u00a04G\u00a0networks we have now.\nIt will be much faster, with download speeds 5-10 times quicker than 4G to start with, meaning a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. Over the next few years it should become even faster, as the technology matures. It will also have lower latency, the time it takes for something to happen: tap a link and the download will start faster.\nBut perhaps the most important thing\u00a05G\u00a0will immediately do for users is increase the carrying capacity of the masts, meaning more people can connect at the same time.\nDespite the International Commission on Non\u2010Ionizing Radiation Protection declaring it to be safe for humans, the technology has been criticised by conspiracy theorists, including celebrities, who have associated it with the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, leading to vandalism attacks on 5G towers.\nSamuel Gibbs, consumer technology editor\u00a0\nBut what greeted them wasn\u2019t just the same collection of alternative medicine proponents and anti-infrastructure nimbys who reliably oppose every new launch.\n\u201cWere we surprised by the existence of opposition? No,\u201d says EE\u2019s head of technology communications, Howard Jones. \u201cWere we surprised by the scale, and the organised nature of it? Yes \u2026 It\u2019s alarmist, very sensationalist and designed to scare.\u201d\nJones is firm: there is absolutely no evidence that 5G, or any other part of the network, is dangerous. \u201cThe wavelengths that 5G uses and will use are all entirely safe and have been in research and testing for decades. It\u2019s a red herring to say it\u2019s a new technology and therefore hasn\u2019t been tested,\u201d he says.\nTo fully debunk the health fears around 5G is impossible: there is no consistent set of claims being made, few explicit studies being cited, and a surfeit of scientific terminology being used in ways that obscure rather than illuminate. Not a single expert the Guardian spoke to believed there was any reliable evidence of harm from 5G or any other part of the publicly licensed broadcast spectrum. And the carriers are emphatic that, in the words of Three UK, \u201cfrom a health and safety perspective, 5G deployment is no different to any other mobile technology \u2026 no harmful levels of radiation are emitted.\u201d\nBut there are themes that recur again and again.\nAt the far end of the range is belief that the 5G rollout is a vast mind control experiment, a successor to the CIA\u2019s MKUltra experiments. There is the fear that 5G will result in a great increase in the number of masts, or the amount of energy sent over the radio spectrum, in a way that will prove harmful. There is a more general concern about the nature of \u201cmillimetre wave\u201d technology, which forms part of the 5G spectrum in some nations (although not, at present, the UK).\nThere\u2019s a belief that the technology is untested, and that the subsequent rollout is in effect an experiment on the population at large. And then there\u2019s a generalised frustration at the fact that the whole thing feels like a fait accompli, presented to the public as an unstoppable force of nature, rather than a consultative process of negotiation.\nIf there were a negotiation, sitting on the side of the opposition would be Martin Pall. A retired professor from Washington State University, Pall\u2019s research interests are practically an encyclopaedia of the medical counterculture, ranging from a novel take on the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome, tinnitus and heart failure to research on the risks of wifi, tanning salons and other emitters of electromagnetic fields.\nIn a 90-page self-published document posted online last May, Pall gave the rallying cry for the 5G opposition: \u201cPutting in tens of millions of 5G antennas without a single biological test of safety has got to be about the stupidest idea anyone has had in the history of the world,\u201d he wrote. That line has been widely quoted, everywhere from the r/conspiracy subreddit to the House of Commons, where Antoniazzi approvingly quoted Pall to accuse the government of \u201csweeping the health concerns under the carpet\u201d.\n\u201cThe extremely inaccurate statements being made by certain MPs was disappointing,\u201d Jones said when I spoke to him after Antoniazzi\u2019s comments. \u201cI think you would expect better from people representing constituents. I would expect a higher standard of research to have been done.\u201d\nBut the problem with calling for research is that it\u2019s very easy to research 5G\u2019s effects on health. Just Google \u201cis 5G bad for health\u201d and you\u2019ll find numerous articles confirming just that: \u201cWhy 5G cell towers are more dangerous \u2013 get the facts!\u201d, reads a headline on RadiationHealthRisks.com, on the first page of Google results. Just above that, an Eluxe Magazine article (\u201cFrightening frequencies: the dangers of 5G\u201d) presents a list of cherry-picked studies demonstrating various harms from various types of radio waves.\nBut these fears are decades old. So why the specific panic about 5G? Everyone has a different answer. Scott Petty, Vodafone\u2019s chief technology officer, says that some of the misinformation stems from the US, where a particular form of 5G using a part of the radio spectrum known as millimetre wave or mmWave technology will be put into use.\nIt hasn\u2019t been used in mobile phone networks before, largely because it\u2019s not particularly good at the job: as a high-frequency part of the spectrum, it\u2019s more easily blocked by things like trees or glass. When there\u2019s clear line of sight, it can carry more information than the parts of the spectrum now used for mobile phones, but not enough to make it worth the trade-off for Vodafone, Petty says.\nThe use of mmWave has allowed some scary inferences to be drawn. The spectrum has previously been used for two other well-reported purposes: the body-scanners installed in airports over the last decade, and an experimental US weapon called the Active Denial System, which fires a high-powered beam at a target, creating a burning sensation.\nIt\u2019s easy to see how that link can be spun into something fearful. But 5G is no more a weapon of war than a wifi router is a microwave oven \u2013 even though both those products use the same part of the spectrum, around the 2.4Ghz mark.\nThe same flaws of mmWave that mean it\u2019s not being used in the UK have led to another line of concern: that in order to get around the problems, carriers will massively increase the number of masts they install. \u201cThat would be true if we only used mmWave,\u201d Petty says, \u201cbut no one is planning that. We will use approximately the same number as we already use for 2, 3 and 4G.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s more half-science. \u201cThe higher the frequency, the more dangerous the spectrum\u201d is, broadly, true: all ionising radiation lies at the extremely high frequencies. But between x-rays and mmWave lies quite a large part of the spectrum that people interact with all the time: visible light.\nIt\u2019s easy for the British industry to dismiss concerns by pointing to mistakes about mmWave technology, but perhaps shortsighted, writes Peter Wingate-Saul, a chartered surveyor who has worked in the telecoms industry for more than 20 years. After all, \u201cyou probably will be using them sooner or later\u201d, so it\u2019s worth avoiding \u201cthe impression that there might be something suspect about them\u201d.\nEE\u2019s Jones has a bolder answer to why 5G misinformation is so widespread, citing a New York Times article that highlighted how popular scary stories about the technology had become on Russia Today. The paper noted that the American version of the channel had run seven documentaries alleging 5G harms in 2019 alone, and argued that the move was part of an effort to hold the US back on rollout of the technology. Russia itself lags behind the pack but hopes to catch up.\n\u201cIt is in and of itself a conspiracy theory, and yet there are points at which it appears quite credible,\u201d Jones says with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting take \u2013 that plays into the idea that it is more concerted than we have seen before.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s the technology effect. In recent years, a number of algorithm changes at Facebook have served to push users away from news and into private groups, where, as the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote earlier this year, they have \u201cthe freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally\u201d.\nBut those groups frequently serve to amplify misinformation, by concentrating like-minded people together and excluding any potential corrective viewpoint. And so, if you search for 5G on Facebook, the suggested groups have a theme: \u201cHalt 5G in the South West\u201d, \u201c5G-MASS ACTION CAMPAIGN GROUP\u201d and \u201c5G - The Facts\u201d \u2013 illustrated with an image reading \u201c5G: Fried brains, anyone?\u201d\nFacebook has taken action against some kinds of medical misinformation on its site, acting to crack down on the more directly harmful spread of scaremongering over vaccines, but it is clear that the site\u2019s very structure supports the spread of these concerns.\n\u201cThe media landscape is now more suited to this kind of news,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThere is a growing scepticism of the mainstream media, there is the rise of the so-called \u201cindependents\u201d, and there is a lack of any real quality control. The viral nature of alarmist, extreme viewpoints is easier to catalyse than ever before. And the overall effect when there\u2019s a lack of trust from authority is that people will seek out other sources.\u201d\nBut Wingate-Saul has a simpler proposition. The No 1 reason for objecting to base stations, he wrote in a presentation last month, is simply that \u201cwe were not even consulted\u201d.\n\u201cIf people are upset, they will perceive a thing as more dangerous \u2026 if people perceive a thing as dangerous, they will become upset,\u201d Wingate-Saul added. \u201cOnce people are upset, they become resistant to reason. Simply \u2018explaining the data\u2019 is not going to work. We are all immune to information we don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d\nSo Wingate-Saul\u2019s advice to those seeking to avoid the fear is simpler. Engage with communities earlier, explain the technology and its constraints in simple non-technical terms, and \u201cpay close attention to aesthetic design and symmetry\u201d. If mobile phone masts are nicer, fewer people will be enraged by them, turn to the internet, and convince themselves they\u2019re dangerous.\nBut it\u2019s probably too late for that to save the reputation of 5G. The rollout is progressing at full speed, and many more sites will be upgraded or installed over the coming months, creating more frustrated residents, and perpetuating the cycle further. Eventually, some will forget and move on, with just a nagging feeling that they ought to be concerned. Others will remain dedicated, until another spark ignites the movement again.\nBased on historical trends, we can expect to see 6G launched in the mid- to late 2020s, using a still higher part of the spectrum. And based on those same trends, we can expect opposition.", "label": 0}, "text-32": {"text": "Labor's climate policies are 'unshakeable' despite election loss, Mark Butler says\nMark Butler wants to make one thing clear: the shadow minister for climate change and energy is not for turning.

The shadow minister, a leftwing powerbroker and close ally of Anthony Albanese, used a speech at a book launch in Canberra to send a message to colleagues that there can be no sugarcoating Labor\u2019s election loss, and all policies, including the ones for which he had direct portfolio responsibility, needed to be subjected to a \u201cruthless and unsparing\u201d review.\nButler says that ruthless and unsparing inquisition is already in train, with campaign reviewers Jay Weatherill (a long-time friend and factional ally) and Craig Emerson considering the impact of various policies on the May result, including his in climate and energy. But he insists the scope of the official reflection is policy detail, not core principle. \u201cOur principles on climate change are utterly clear and unshakeable.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not yet sure which specific election commitments survive the cull, and which don\u2019t, but Labor, he says, will implement the Paris agreement, look for policies that will keep warming below 2C, move to net zero emissions by 2050 and set medium-term emissions reduction targets \u201cthat are consistent with these principles and guided by the best available scientific and economic advice\u201d.\nAs well as looking at how to recalibrate the policy offering within those fixed parameters, Butler says Labor is also looking at its messaging. He says Labor has not been clear enough in the past that the transition in coal communities that will happen as a result of decarbonisation is more a function of decisions being made by trading partners in Australia\u2019s major export markets than of domestic climate regulation.\nHe says it is hard to separate out what is happening globally from what is happening locally and communicate that comprehensively when Labor is being wedged on both the right and the left, but he says \u201cthat is the challenge, to try and make those things a little clearer\u201d.\nButler says working on the interface between Labor\u2019s climate policies and the viability of coal communities in regional Queensland and the Hunter Valley is \u201csomething we are going to have to work hard on dealing with over the next couple of years\u201d.\n\u201cDecisions taken by our trading partners have a very real impact on regional communities \u2026 I understand why people feel so passionately about this, and want to have some agency in it, but it is our responsibility as politicians to speak truth. What happens to mines, whether they can wash their face, is not going to be determined at all by what happens in [Canberra] \u2013 it\u2019s a direct function of the export market.\u201d\nHe says while Labor understands the backlash in coal communities that has prompted fellow frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon, who represents an electorate in the Hunter, to speak out more assertively and positively about coal \u2013 he argues there is no substantial internal dissent about climate ambition. He says the new Labor MPs who have entered parliament post-election have made it clear they believe climate action is a core part of the social democratic project in 2019.\nBut he says the political environment, for Labor, remains fraught. The Greens, with crossbench backing, are proposing to bring forward a parliamentary motion declaring a climate emergency. Butler says it is abundantly clear there is a climate emergency. \u201cI\u2019ve said so in the parliament on a number of occasions.\u201d But he says there is also zero prospect of that motion getting up in the current parliament, and he\u2019s \u201cnot sure it is realistic to have a debate\u201d.\nIf we get to 2030 with the level of inertia we\u2019ve had over the last decade, then we have profoundly let down our children and grandchildren.\nHe says some in the Coalition are also emboldened by the May victory, and as a consequence of the voter affirmation, there will be a centre of gravity in the centre right that wants to keep weaponising climate change as an issue. Butler says the past decade in Australian politics has demonstrated there is a \u201cbusiness model\u201d in division, and Labor has washed up consistently since the Rudd period on the wrong side of bursts hyper-partisanship on the left and the right.\nWhile he has concern about some in the government digging in and declaring climate change \u201calways has to be weaponised\u201d \u2013 he also thinks it is possible Scott Morrison will shift on climate during the coming term, particularly if the Australian community remains vocal on the issue, and business also continues to demand policy certainty to allow it to deal with carbon risk. He says for people who want practical climate action, as opposed to rhetoric, bipartisanship remains \u201cthe holy grail\u201d.\nButler says Morrison is not Malcolm Turnbull on climate, and not Tony Abbott, but somewhere in the middle. He suspects the prime minister has no \u201cdeep beliefs\u201d on the issue, but that could enable him to pivot to a more plausible policy position in the event he makes a judgment that climate change is harming the electoral prospects of the Coalition. Perhaps Morrison, he says, can take \u201csome baby steps to break down the culture war\u201d.\nHe says while there is a significant risk climate change will become even more polarised in Australia as citizens become more frustrated and angry with the lack of policy action, and elements of the Coalition seek to weaponise the issue against progressive parties in contests in the coal basins \u2013 community organisation and action is very important over the coming parliamentary term. \u201cIt is really valuable to have the community put pressure on this building,\u201d he says.\nButler says all the survey evidence he has seen indicates Australian voters are alarmed by the lack of policy action on climate change, and the issue rates second behind concerns about cost of living pressure. He says he is \u201cutterly convinced\u201d that public opinion in favour of action is \u201cbroad, deep and growing\u201d.\nPoliticians, he says, need to be particularly aware that young people are hugely motivated on climate change. Butler has teenaged children and meets regularly with young activists.\n\u201cI can see it in their eyes,\u201d he says. \u201cThey think our generation is from a different planet.\u201d He says there is a risk of climate change widening the generation gap, which is more substantial now, he thinks, than at any time since the 1960s, \u201cand we know what happened out of that\u201d \u2013 good things, he says, \u201cbut a lot of turmoil\u201d.\nHe says the challenge of the term will be to try and keep moving forward and to build a constituency for change. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in the next decade to have the wars we\u2019ve had in the last decade. The last decade was supposed to be the critical decade. I don\u2019t know what beyond critical is.\n\u201cIf we get to 2030 with the level of inertia we\u2019ve had over the last decade, then we have profoundly let down our children and grandchildren\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-33": {"text": "Climate crisis: 6 million people join latest wave of global protests\nSix million people have taken to the streets over the past week, uniting across timezones, cultures and generations to demand urgent action on the escalating ecological emergency.\nA fresh wave of climate strikes swept around the globe on Friday with an estimated 2 million people walking out of schools and workplaces.\nOrganisers say that during the week of protests \u2013 that began with a global climate strike last week \u2013 a total of 6 million people, from trade unionists to schoolchildren, have taken part in thousands of towns and cities.\n\u201cThis week was a demonstration of the power of our movement,\u201d said a spokesperson for the FridaysForFuture group which has helped coordinate the demonstrations. \u201cPeople power is more powerful than the people in power.

One person holds a poster for five minutes, then hands over to the next person who is waiting nearby. That way, we don\u2019t have any problems because it is a series of solo strikes rather than a group gathering,\u201d said the 25-year-old violinist, a graduate of the Moscow Conservatory.\nDemonstrations also took place across South America, from Mexico City\u2019s vast Z\u00f3calo square to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.\nOn Bogot\u00e1\u2019s high Andean plain, the environmental movement has faced a severe crackdown. In July, protesters across Colombia pleaded for an end to the violence that has resulted in numerous activists being killed, with the peace and development thinktank Indepaz putting the figure at 734 deaths in the first seven months of 2019.\n\u201cWe want to keep fracking out of our country and demand an immediate change towards decarbonisation,\u201d said the activist Susana Muhamad, who was planning to march past the offices of the country\u2019s largest petroleum company, Ecopetrol.\nIn Brazil, organisers said there were climate protests in S\u00e3o Paulo and at least nine other cities.

But there are not examples, at least in the modern era, of players across an entire league threatening action.

The demands to be aptly compensated for representing your country felt a just cause, but this did not translate to the game at club level.\nWhat makes this threatened action significantis that it is about the day-to-day, the right to a decent standard of living and an unwillingness to go on accepting that professional standards be demanded of players without the contracts and pay to reflect it.\nTellingly, it is not a handful of players threatening to strike; 189 representatives voted 93% in favour of taking action across the league\u2019s 16 clubs.\nThe top contracted players are standing shoulder to shoulder with the poorest. Six players from the champions, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, attended the meeting which voted so overwhelmingly for action. Four turned out from Barcelona, including the Spanish national team\u2019s fourth-highest goalscorer, Jenni Hermoso. They are symbolically backing the push for a collective bargaining agreement across the league, which would include as a minimum \u20ac16,000 (\u00a313,800) annually for a 40-hour working week, \u20ac12,000 for a part-time 30-hour week, maternity leave and paid time off.\nThese wages are low. They may be higher than Spain\u2019s minimum wage of approximately \u20ac12,600 a year for 2019, but they are significantly lower than the average wage of Spanish workers which is \u20ac23,000, according to the country\u2019s office of national statistics.\nThere may be a fear that clubs will struggle to pay, in particular the four teams without the backing of a men\u2019s club \u2013 Madrid CFF, Sporting de Huelva, Logro\u00f1o and UDG Tenerife \u2013 but serious questions have to be asked about the commitment of those clubs and the league if that is the case. Clubs receive \u20ac350,000 a season from the federation (a requirement as a government organisation, not out of the goodness of their hearts) and they are being offered \u20ac500,000 by the league for their TV rights. If the welfare and support of players is not the number one priority and is not what sustainability is being built around, then what is the focus?\nFor the 12 teams backed by wealthy men\u2019s clubs the excuses are even more moot.\nThat clubs are digging in and resistant to the most minimal of employment rights for their players ispretty galling.\nStrike action is always a last resort.

But after suffering a significant mental breakdown last year, followed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety, he has decided to leave the force.\nHe said: \u201cI went from being the UK\u2019s top arresting officer to being so troubled by what I\u2019d seen and done in the line of duty that I\u2019ve had to walk away from the very job that defined me.\u201d\nLivingstone, 36, who is writing a book about his experience, said his PTSD was not linked to a single incident but the \u201ccumulative effect of being exposed to trauma all day, every day\u201d.\nSuffolk police\u2019s deputy chief constable, Rachel Kearton, paid tribute to Livingstone\u2019s bravery in talking about his mental health problems and said she hoped it would encourage other officers to come forward.\nBut she also warned financial pressure was increasing the workload and stress on officers and hampering forces\u2019 ability to help burned-out police.\nShe said: \u201cOnce upon a time when there had been a crisis I would be able to give [officers] some respite by taking them away from the frontline. That is no longer an option because of the increased demand that we are dealing with and the stretch on the resources.\u201d\nShe said cuts meant police were increasingly \u201cpicking up a number of issues from other agencies that we didn\u2019t have to deal with before\u201d. These include filling in gaps in the health service by taking vulnerable members of the public to hospital.\nThe Police Federation chair, John Apter, said Livingstone\u2019s decision to quit illustrated a wider problem. He said: \u201cThis is happening far, far too often now within policing, where hard-working, dedicated officers who still enjoy the job are being forced to leave because they have been ground down by the relentless pace of policing in the current climate.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cDCC Kearton is absolutely right \u2013 we are the service that can never say no and already-stretched officers are now increasingly forced to deal with incidents including mental health crises because other agencies are either closed for the day or subject to the same austerity cuts that we have suffered.\n\u201cBut it is precisely because we are a 24-hour emergency service who are there when other agencies are closed that police officers are becoming broken; they need to be able to step away from duty when they are ill or stressed, and be given proper time to recuperate in the right environment, supported by healthcare or other appropriate professionals.\n\u201cThey need adequate time to rest. Police officers are not robots \u2013 they are human beings who, despite the uniform they wear and the training they undergo, have their limits.\u201d\nLivingstone praised Suffolk police for the mental health support they provided after his breakdown and he singled out Kearton for thanks.\nKearton said she would welcome Livingtone back to the force \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d.

Was it for a famous pop star, a beloved politician or a nationally treasured athlete? Nope, it was the funeral of Jean-Paul Sartre, the French existential philosopher and winner of the Nobel prize in literature (which he refused, along with the $500,000 prize money, out of concern it would compromise his independent thinking). In America, that mass public display of grief and affection is usually reserved for pop culture icons, not unapologetic intellectuals. Maybe it\u2019s time to rethink that priority.\nI can\u2019t imagine the death of an American philosopher or literary writer drawing such a large crowd. But we do turn out for our fallen sports heroes: Babe Ruth had 150,000 at his funeral and Muhammad Ali had 100,000. Both well deserved. On the other hand, how many attended the 1996 funeral of equally deserving American poet laureate Joseph Brodsky, an immigrant who won the Nobel prize in literature in 1987? I don\u2019t know the answer because the information isn\u2019t even available. Can most of us even name a single contemporary American philosopher or influential literary author with the ease we can a Kardashian? If the answer is no, our initial reaction should be a slight sense of shame (and maybe a quick Google search), but more likely it would be to scoff and dismiss the question with a smug \u201cWho cares?\u201d But this instant dismissal really reflects a troubling trend of lazy and arrogant anti-intellectualism that has very real and dangerous consequences to American society.\nThe difference between the way Americans regard athletes versus \u201cintellectuals\u201d is a good touchstone for how we see ourselves. One statistic showed 93% of men watching sports, while another concludes that about 60% of Americans consider themselves sports fans. Count me in. I\u2019m grateful for America\u2019s love of sports, a love I share as a major fan of baseball and basketball. Sports have become ingrained in our society as a means of activity for personal health and as an educational tool to teach moral values such as sportsmanship, discipline and teamwork. Even more significant, athletes are second only to parents as role models for kids. While that places a lot of pressure on athletes, some of whom are still very young themselves, many others have stepped up to accept that responsibility.\nAt the same time we\u2019re increasingly embracing sports, the last few years have produced a rising anti-intellectualism, starting with facts, science and logic. Anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, even flat-earthers are on the rise. Part of the reason for this is the promotion of fuzzy thinking as a positive political statement. All those people who were told in school that their opinions lack any meaningful support and are filled with logical fallacies can now band together in shared ignorance masquerading as conservative ethos. They get to thumb their noses at the \u201celite\u201d thinkers.\nPresident Trump is the figurehead of celebrating irrational thinking as a patriotic act. He\u2019s the rabble rouser in the saloon whipping the mob into a lynching frenzy. Every time there\u2019s a snow storm, he comments about this being proof that there is no global warming. And he keeps doing this despite the scientific experts explaining that there is a vast difference between weather and climate. Just as his explanations about \u201cclean coal\u201d show a fundamental lack of understanding about what that even means. And there\u2019s his absolution of the crimes of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman, despite the evidence put forth by his own intelligence experts. This kind of convoluted thinking has led to the dismantling of EPA protections, attacks on voter access and open political corruption without consequences. The lesson for our children: ignore facts and evidence if it disagrees with what benefits you personally. Even if it means everyone else will suffer. Ironically, that\u2019s the opposite lesson that sports teach about sacrificing for the good of the team.\nThat\u2019s the philosophy of the anti-vaxxers, who have justified their silliness through junk science and discredited physicians. Suddenly, they know more than the scientists who have been researching it for years, more than the statistics that show measles having been nearly wiped out until they started allowing it to spread. Measles is now on the rise, killing people across the world. Doctors claim that if the current trend continues, 2019 could produce the worst measles outbreak in the US in decades. What is their criteria for when to reject or embrace doctors? Are they leaning over the surgeon\u2019s shoulders during brain surgery on loved ones advising what to do next?\nWe should have a healthy attitude of skepticism regarding experts because they have not always been proven right. But skepticism isn\u2019t the same as believing nutty conspiracy theories. Skepticism means requiring evidence through scientific method (something that ushered in the Enlightenment). Instead, we even have what psychologists call the Dunning-Kruger Effect, in which people of low knowledge have the illusion that their opinions are superior to those of experts. They like to tout their innate \u201ccommon sense\u201d, which throughout history has been proven to be the worst kind of sense. Worse, because they eschew logic, politicians have targeted them with a constant barrage of emotional gobbledygook reasoning to pump up their egos without challenging their minds. They are led around by the nose, voting how they are told but thinking they are independent.\nA culture can admire both the physical and intellectual. The achievements of athletes inspire us to push the boundaries of what our bodies are capable of. We can run faster, jump higher, endure more punishment than we thought. That makes us all realize we have untapped potential. Equally, we can be inspired by the insights of our poets, the vision of our philosophers, the medical breakthroughs of our scientists. Both should make us strive to be greater: stronger and smarter. The problem is that when the average person sees an athlete perform an amazing feat, there\u2019s the lurking belief that, if they really wanted to train and practice, they could do it, too. It is within their grasp. But with intellectual feats, some people see that as beyond their understanding and therefore beyond their reach. Rather than strive, they resent. It\u2019s easier to look up baseball stats than read an article on melting ice caps. Plus, there\u2019s an implied pressure to the latter: if I accept that something is wrong, am I not obligated to do something about it? It\u2019s easier to deny, deny, deny. Like those \u201ccommon sense\u201d citizens who loudly decried the existence of germs, the benefits of penicillin, or the evidence of DNA, such anti-intellectualism leads to sickness, death and the hobbling of a society\u2019s progress.\nIntellectuals don\u2019t help their cause when they are dismissive of pop culture and sports, by demeaning their great achievements. Neither high culture nor pop culture are a measure of intelligence, just of past exposure. Any attempt to use either as a means to imply superiority demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of what art strives to do: bring us closer together by showing that we are all equal in our needs to love, be loved, and strive to be better tomorrow than we are today. We accomplish this by understanding that the elegant idea is as uplifting as the slam dunk. And that a triple play is as graceful as a balletic arabesque. To disparage either the athlete or the intellect indicates someone not worthy of either.", "label": 0}, "text-41": {"text": "Lack of PPE forces Aboriginal health groups to stop testing for coronavirus\nA number of Aboriginal health groups in Victoria have been forced to cease Covid-19 testing and consider shutting their doors due to a lack of personal protective equipment.\nThe Guardian revealed last week that Aboriginal medical services in New South Wales, particularly in regional areas, were struggling to access the PPE needed to safely treat and test for the virus.\nSome clinics had just two weeks of PPE left with no immediate prospect of re-supply, creating a situation they described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.\nThe Guardian understands the NSW government has now written to the commonwealth asking for the urgent release of supplies to the state\u2019s Aboriginal medical services and for direct access to the government\u2019s national medical stockpile.\nThe problem, though, is not confined to NSW.\nIn Victoria, Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations have warned they are facing \u201ccritical\u201d PPE shortages, which have forced some into the difficult position of stopping Covid-19 testing until new stock is provided.\nA number of Aboriginal health groups are making their own PPE to get by, according to the the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation Inc (VACCHO), the peak body for Indigenous health and wellbeing in the state.\nOthers have considered closing entirely because they cannot source enough equipment.\nVACCHO chair Karen Heap said the centre she runs in Ballarat \u2013 the Ballarat & District Aboriginal Co-Operative \u2013 had run out of PPE and been forced to close temporarily last week.\nThe centre was conducting Covid-19 testing for Indigenous Australians and has since re-opened.

When I was ready to go back, the Guardian was advertising for an online political correspondent. Like all sensible journalists, I had always wanted to work for the Guardian, but it was a time when political blogging was taking off, and I was also starting to think that online offered opportunities to cover politics in better ways. I got hired.\nWhen I joined, sport were using live blogs regularly but in news they were relatively rare and almost never the main vehicle for covering a political event on the website. I started using them a lot, they got longer and more detailed, and editors and readers were enthusiastic. A big breakthrough came with the Iraq inquiry in late 2009, when we led the website with my inquiry blog, rather than a conventional news story, for days on end. I remember it as the moment when editors became comfortable with the idea of anchoring web coverage around a blog. In 2010 I did a daily general election blog and after the election was over it just kept going as Politics Live.\nI work in the Guardian office in the House of Commons and I start at about 8am. Sometimes I go to lobby briefings, or I take my laptop to events that are not being televised, but mostly I\u2019m at my desk monitoring events in parliament and elsewhere on TV, but also keeping track of what is happening via the news wires, email, Twitter, WhatsApp etc. It\u2019s a hybrid job; part reporting, but also largely editing.\nEven though it\u2019s unrelenting (a live blog does not work if you head off for a long lunch with a contact), I find it much more rewarding. As a newspaper reporter I would often end the day feeling that I had learned 20 interesting things, only about four or five of which I could get into the paper. The chat in the office was often more stimulating than what we were publishing. That was not because of a conspiracy to conceal information; it was just that, unless you could shoehorn information into the rigid format of a news story, you could not get it into the public domain.\nWriting a blog, that is not a problem. Partly that\u2019s because space is unlimited. But mostly it\u2019s a matter of having more elbow room as a journalist. Without being constrained by the conventions of writing a news story, there is more opportunity for commentary and analysis; for covering not just what happens, but what it means and why it matters. Now I never go home feeling I haven\u2019t had the chance to share what I know.\nThey\u2019ve generated a surge of interest. I\u2019ve been writing the live blog for almost 10 years and it\u2019s never had such a big readership: 1m-plus hits a day on average in the first quarter of the year, when the Brexit crisis was acute. It\u2019s less now, but the blog is almost always one of the five most read articles on the website on any day, and quite often it\u2019s the best read.\nYou need three things for a live blog to work: what I call \u201cnow news\u201d (that is, news you want to read immediately, not over breakfast tomorrow); a story that keeps changing; and a story that people want to read at length. Brexit ticks all these boxes.\nA bit. If you have six hours to think about a politician\u2019s speech, you will produce a more considered view than you can in 20-30 minutes (my timeframe \u2013 I write a lot of \u201csnap verdicts\u201d). But there is an intense demand for instant news and, if we don\u2019t meet it, someone else will. There is a famous 19th century Times editorial saying the first duty of the press is to obtain \u201cthe earliest and most correct intelligence of the events of the time\u201d and, by disclosing them, make them \u201cthe common property of the nation\u201d. That still stands; it is just that \u201cearliest\u201d is quicker than it used to be. I also think the assumption \u201cfast news must be flawed\u201d is wrong: sometimes the quickest takes are the sharpest.\nMore than they probably realise. My blog regularly attracts 10,000 or more comments a day. I can\u2019t read them all, but I read some and I try to reply to anyone who asks me a direct question (by wordsearching \u201cAndrew\u201d).\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m giving away any trade secrets if I say not all journalists welcome being told they\u2019re wrong. Who does? But the live blog format makes it possible to have a very constructive relationship with readers. Once a reporter files a story, it\u2019s over, and any non-positive feedback counts as a complaint. But my blog is open for eight or more hours a day, and when people point out mistakes, or challenge my judgment, there is time for me to respond.\nIn my book, no error is too minor to correct (if you care about getting the small things right, you\u2019re more likely to get the big things right too) and if people question my analysis or language, as long as they\u2019re not offensive, I\u2019m happy to consider their point. Over time I\u2019ve realised this scrutiny makes me a much better reporter. I spend around 20 minutes a day reading and replying to comments, and it\u2019s a part of my routine I always find illuminating.\n", "label": 0}, "text-43": {"text": "Galileo Wins Court Case\n\u2018Vindicated. The score is 17-nil, the judge\u2019s findings were damning. It could not have gone better,\u2019 Professor Peter Ridd explains shortly after the historic judgement in\u00a0Ridd v. James Cook University\u00a0was handed down in Brisbane last week.\nThis was a momentous occasion. It came 1,082 days after this whole ordeal began when Ridd was first unlawfully censured by the university for sending an email to a journalist for criticising the reliability of science about the Great Barrier Reef and 511 days after Ridd was informed that he violated the university policies for an appearance on Sky News.\nJudge Salvatore Vasta explains in the judgement that, in narrowest formulation, the case is a dispute under the\u00a0Fair Work Act\u00a0and \u2018purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an Enterprise Agreement\u2019. However, the implications of this case for free speech at Australia\u2019s universities are broad. There is now a clear legal precedent that protects the ability for academics to express controversial ideas in a forthright manner. This is an absolute necessity for our universities to function, for academics to be able to separate good ideas from the bad in the pursuit of truth. This is not just a left-right issue. The precedent set by the Ridd case will serve to protect everyone, even radical left-winger Tim Anderson who is currently challenging University of Sydney for his sacking in the courts.\nThis case was never straightforward. \u2018It has been a very difficult time,\u2019 Ridd says. \u2018I had felt like I was hunted down and fired and my reputation as a scientist tarnished.\u2019 The university came after Ridd time and time again, which required the raising of $260,000 from 2,405 donors across the world to mount a legal defence. He was told to stop critiquing his colleagues\u2019 science. His emails were searched and used against him. He was instructed to remain silent about the disciplinary process, and not even speak about it with his wife. On this last point, Judge Vasta described the university\u2019s actions as \u2018quite frankly, appalling\u2019 and the lack of apology as \u2018inexcusable\u2019.\nThis case ultimately came down to whether academic freedom, enshrined in section 14 of Ridd\u2019s Enterprise Agreement but a principle that pre-exists the establishment of JCU, had any real meaning in the context of university policies that require collegiality and upholding the university\u2019s reputation. Properly constructed, the written words of the contractual agreement take precedence over the university policies. If it went the other way around and the intellectual freedom provision was narrow in its application, as the university asserted, it would render the intellectual freedom protection completely meaningless.\nJCU complained that Ridd\u2019s criticisms of his colleagues\u2019 science was not undertaken in a collegial and academic spirit, as required by JCU\u2019s\u00a0Code of Conduct. \u2018But there is no need for such enquiry, examination, criticism or challenge to be done that way under the rights conferred upon Professor Ridd by cl.14 [the intellectual freedom provision],\u2019 Judge Vasta concluded. The Judge also expressed the view that \u2018rather than disciplining Professor Ridd, the better option would have been to provide evidence that would illustrate the errors in what he has said.\u2019\nJudge Vasta also explained that intellectual freedom \u2018allows academics to express their opinions without fear of reprisals. It allows a Charles Darwin to break free of the constraints of creationism. It allows an Albert Einstein to break free of the constraints of Newtonian physics. It allows the human race to question conventional wisdom in the neverending search for knowledge and truth. And that, at its core, is what higher learning is about.\u2019\nThe Ridd judgement is a huge victory for free speech \u2013 but the fight may only just be beginning. JCU has responded to the judgement like a screaming child incapable of being told they\u2019re wrong. Rather than admit guilt and apologise, JCU has rejected the judgement in a lengthy statement and left open the possibility of using their taxpayer-funded resources to appeal.\nIf so, this process could continue for years and even reach the highest court in the land. Thankfully there are many who remain committed. As one commentator on Ridd\u2019s GoFundMe wrote last week: \u2018If you need more money I think collectively your supporters will see you through to the High Court if that is what it takes.\u2019\nRidd\u2019s experience might also be unique. \u2018I have never felt as elated as when the cavalry of 2,405 GoFundMe donors came to the rescue,\u2019 Ridd said. For most, this cavalry will never arrive. It is also too big a risk for many to put their livelihoods on the line for the sake of principle. It\u2019s much easier to just keep your head down and be uncontroversial. Additionally, students, the ones who are being exposed to fewer arguments and are receiving a weaker education, have no contractual protection for free intellectual inquiry.\nJCU\u2019s decision to go after Ridd and argue that intellectual freedom is a narrow concept is a serious indictment on the state of free speech at Australia\u2019s universities. As Stuart Wood QC, Ridd\u2019s barrister, explained in his concluding remarks: \u2018We\u2019ve listened for a day to the university advocating for a narrow construction of intellectual freedom. It would be like listening to someone from the church come and advocate for a narrow view of religious freedom.\u2019\nIn the damming conclusion to the judgement, Judge Vasta says that:\n\u2018Incredibly, the university has not understood the whole concept of intellectual freedom. In the search for truth, it is an unfortunate consequence that some people may feel denigrated, offended, hurt or upset. It may not always be possible to act collegiately when diametrically opposed views clash in the search for truth.\u2019\nJCU is not the only university that doesn\u2019t get this. Right across Australia, academics are still self-censoring. University policies, as former Chief Justice Robert French\u2019s\u00a0University Freedom of Speech Review\u00a0found, can limit free expression. There is a serious lack of diversity of viewpoint and challenging of ideas from different perspectives.\nRidd\u2019s success is a huge victory, but it is just the start.\nMatthew Lesh\u2019s profile on Peter Ridd appeared in the May 2018 edition of the IPA Review and can be viewed here.", "label": 1}, "text-44": {"text": "Afghan public health chief settles in UK after kidnap by Taliban\nA senior Afghan government official has been given sanctuary in the UK after being kidnapped and tortured by the Taliban.\nDr Mohammad Haqmal, 42, is a public health chief of international standing, who developed a series of groundbreaking programmes in his home country. He was forced to flee Afghanistan after his kidnap. On Monday he was awarded Public Health National Hero 2019 \u2013 the second time he has won the award \u2013 in absentia for his work by the Afghanistan parliament.\nHaqmal said that his case raised questions over Home Office guidance that states it is safe to forcibly send some asylum seekers back to parts of Afghanistan including the capital Kabul, where his attack took place.\n\u201cKabul is not a safe place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are thousands of examples of people being targeted by the Taliban there including asylum seekers sent back from the UK. My government could not protect me.\u201d\nJournalist and political adviser Mena Mangal was recently shot dead in Kabul.\nHaqmal completed a medical degree in 2003 in Afghanistan and has 15 years\u2019 experience in public health management and research. Along the way he has acquired three master\u2019s qualifications in health research, including one from University College London.\nIn Afghanistan he developed an initiative called the $1 project, which aimed to provide universal healthcare in remote areas. His work saved the lives of 2,500 mothers over an 18-month period in two districts with the poorest health indicators in the world. He has presented his research at prestigious international public health bodies including the International Health Economics Association and American Public Health Association.\nLike Malala Yousafzai, who also defied the Taliban, Haqmal is a passionate advocate for the rights of girls and women and for access to education for them. \u201cEverything links together \u2013 health, education and the rights of women,\u201d he said.\nHaqmal\u2019s achievements are particularly remarkable because of his impoverished childhood and the various tragedies that have blighted his life.\nHe first fled Afghanistan for a refugee camp in Pakistan at the age of five after Russian troops burned his village and killed more than 72 people. Most of his family were not in the village at the time. He and his mother were the only two who survived the attack and managed to escape.\n\u201cThis was my first tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a human being it is difficult to forget something like this but sometimes it can make you stronger and more resilient.\u201d\nAs a child in the refugee camp he was resourceful and began buying ice and glasses so that he could sell chilled water to people. The money he earned helped him get through school and get to medical school despite living in dire poverty.\nAfter excelling in public health work on the ground he was offered a role at Afghanistan\u2019s ministry of public health. He survived various suicide bomb attacks by the Taliban, who targeted government buildings.\nHis real problems began when he defied Taliban requests to assign their prisoners in prison hospitals \u201cuntreatable\u201d status so they could be released. This status was given to prisoners suffering from terminal illnesses or other very serious medical conditions. Taliban leaders were exerting pressure on doctors like Haqmal to sign these relatively healthy prisoners out of jail so they could return to fighting.\nBecause he refused to do so when there were no clinical grounds to justify the decision, he began receiving threats and on 5 May last year he was seized by four armed men on motorbikes just 20 metres away from a government checkpoint. He was handcuffed, blindfolded and driven to a house 30 minutes away where he was held in a basement. He was told he would be killed for refusing to agree to Taliban requests to release their prisoners.\n\u201cThey tortured me both mentally and physically,\u201d he said. They continually put a knife to his neck indicating that they were about to execute him.\nHaqmal believed he would die during his kidnap ordeal. He was saved by the sound of vehicles because his captors feared it was the Afghan police and ran away. He managed to untie his hands, which were bound with a kind of plastic chain, by biting through it, escaped barefoot and ran until he reached the road and found a taxi.\nNow the Home Office has granted him refugee status in the UK he is hoping to work in the public health sector. \u201cI don\u2019t like to stay with social benefits.

On Tuesday, it looked like something might have changed.\nThe decision by BlackRock \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest asset manager \u2013 to exit investments that \u201cpresent a high sustainability-related risk\u201d has been welcomed by environmentalists as a significant moment in the battle to reshape the relationship between money and the climate crisis.\nThe move is \u201ca remarkable breakthrough\u201d, the leading climate science writer Bill McKibben told the Guardian. \u201cThe activists who made this happen get the afternoon off to celebrate.\n\u201cThis is the biggest pot of money in the world and until today, its leaders have refused to acknowledge the biggest thing happening on the planet \u2013 the accelerating rise in temperature. So it indicates that the facts on the ground of the climate crisis are so grave that no one can turn away, and that activist pressure has reached a point that even the richest companies are not immune.\u201d\nIn two letters on Monday, the BlackRock boss, Larry Fink, announced: \u201cThe evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance\u201d and henceforth the company would divest $500m from coal-related businesses.\nThe announcement called on \u201cevery company, not just energy firms, to rethink their carbon footprints\u201d.\nBlackRock, which holds $7tn in assets, has come under intense pressure to reform the funds it offers investors.\n\u201cAwareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,\u201d Fink wrote, adding that new funds would allow clients to avoid investments in companies that may be adding to climate change.\nThe firm said it doubled to 150 the number of exchange-traded funds it offers that address social, environmental or governance issues.\nIn November, climate activists protested outside BlackRock\u2019s London offices, dumping ashes to signify the Amazon fires while Extinction Rebellion, the global environmental movement, described BlackRock as the world\u2019s top investor in deforestation and coal. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging action, while BlackRock was named as an investor with one of the worst voting records on climate issues by Ceres, a not-for-profit watchdog that pushes financial firms to consider sustainability.\nThe pressure for change has come from within the world of finance as well as outside. Last month, Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England, warned that pension funds risk seeing their assets become worthless unless companies rapidly rise to the challenge of the climate crisis.\nBut while some celebrated, others warned that sustainable investing will not be quick or simple for BlackRock. It currently holds a 6.7% stake in ExxonMobil, 6.9% in Chevron, and 6% in the mining company Glencore. Two-thirds of its $7tn in assets are in tracking funds that cannot easily be switched to meet sustainability goals.\nMcKibben, who last year published a devastating report in the New Yorker titled Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warming Burns and who is part of a campaign to force companies including Goldman Sachs, Chase Bank and BlackRock to reform their investments, said environmentalists would now need to keep the pressure up.\n\u201cThe steps BlackRock is taking are baby steps, and we will have to watch and push hard for them to begin striding at the pace we need to go. But in some sense, the first step is often the hardest,\u201d McKibben said.\nHe urged the company to go further. Its decision to divest $500m from coal-related businesses, for instance, is not the same as divesting from larger and far more polluting oil and gas industries.\n\u201cCoal is part of the problem, but not the biggest part of the problem \u2013 oil and gas are,\u201d McKibben said. \u201cFink made noises that natural gas is part of the solution but it\u2019s not. That\u2019s old thinking, and we\u2019ll push them hard on that, but at least we\u2019ve reached the point that they\u2019ve realized they have a role in dealing with the climate crisis.\u201d\nBut perhaps the largest change is BlackRock\u2019s apparent willingness to use its considerable shareholder power to demand climate action \u2013 a power it has in the past demurred from using in favor of direct company consultations.\nA report last year by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project claimed that BlackRock had voted overwhelmingly against key climate resolutions at energy companies, including ExxonMobil.\nHad BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claimed.\n\u201cWe have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,\u201d BlackRock said in a statement to the Guardian at the time. But, it warned, \u201cit would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal\u2019s impact\u201d.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s statement, that position appeared to be shifting from last year when it said that \u201crecent extreme weather events\u201d and \u201cthe implications for investment portfolios \u2013 stemming from a rising frequency and intensity of such events \u2013 have been notoriously hard for investors to grasp\u201d.\nNo longer. Now BlackRock\u2019s CEO writes that company directors should be held accountable \u201cwhere we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues\u201d. He added that \u201cthe company voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies\u201d last year.\nThere are still worries for environmentalists. Majority Action\u2019s Eli Kasargod-Staub warned that subtlety in BlackRock\u2019s language calling for companies to improve disclosure on \u201cintegrating and reporting on sustainability\u201d is not the same as calling for immediate action.\n\u201cBlackRock has the power to be going to corporate directors and saying: \u2018Either you commit to the science-based targets of the Paris climate agreement and align your operations, governance, political spending, lobby and trade association activities to achieve that target or we will vote against you and your directors,\u2019\u201d Kasargod-Staub said.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not what BlackRock said \u2013 they said they\u2019re calling on companies to enhance their disclosures around climate risks and their plans around those risks,\u201d he added.\nKasargod-Staub pointed to this quote from BlackRock, directed at companies it invests in: \u201cThis should include your plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD [Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures] guidelines.\u201d\n\u201cThink about how passive that sentence is, then think about the behavior of ExxonMobil or Marathon petroleum, who through their capital expenditures and policy influence have actively undermined our ability to protect long-term investors and meet the goals of the Paris agreement,\u201d said Kasargod-Staub.\nWhether Blackrock is now going to side with activist resolutions on sustainability remains to be seen during shareholder season, McKibben said, but he warned against expecting a shift by fossil-fuel energy producers to become carbon-neutral.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the big oil companies are capable of changing, though I\u2019d like to be proved wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe job is basically to starve them and reduce their ability to continue expanding.\u201d\nStill, McKibben said: \u201cFor all of us that have been campaigning for years around climate finances, this is an historic moment. From today, it\u2019s going to be harder to go sink of load of money in Exxon, because the biggest financial firm in the world has said, \u2018Huh, there\u2019s something to this climate stuff.

The stock recovered most of its losses by the close of trading to finish down 6.5% at 214.8p.\nAnnual results published more than 10 hours late on Friday revealed that Sports Direct was struggling during tough trading conditions on the high street.\nThe delay was caused by the sudden arrival of a \u20ac674m initial bill from the Belgian authorities, relating to VAT charges on goods moved within the EU. Sports Direct only has 35 stores in Belgium but has two warehouses in the country.\nSports Direct defended its handling of the matter after the stock market closed on Monday. The company said it received notice of the tax bill at midday on Thursday and contacted its lawyers immediately. It did not receive further details of the demand until 11pm on Thursday, meaning its auditor Grant Thornton had to update its audit the next day.\nThe Financial Times reported that Grant Thornton has told regulators it intends to quit as Sports Direct\u2019s auditor after the retailer\u2019s annual general meeting in September, after concern over the delay in passing on information about the tax bill. In its statement on Friday, Sports Direct made clear it wanted Grant Thornton to stay on . \nLogistics experts said the VAT bill could relate to either the movement of goods between Belgium and the retailer\u2019s main distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, or online sales.\nThe company has reassured investors the bill was unlikely to result in the full amount falling due with one year. But some analysts said a \u00a354.6m operating loss at House of Fraser, which Sports Direct bought for \u00a390m nearly a year ago, only compounded difficulties at the group\u2019s established UK sports stores, where sales fell 1.6% . The company admitted its relationship with brands was \u201ccurrently challenging\u201d, despite efforts to improve the look of its Sports Direct stores.\n\u201cThe home truths about the core Sports Direct business were pretty shocking and management seems to be out of ideas,\u201d said analysts at the brokerage firm Peel Hunt. \u201cWhilst Sports Direct may have done all the likes of Nike and Adidas asked them to do in the flagship stores, the premium product that maybe it was expecting as a consequence has not emerged.

During the segment, he claimed that the government was not allowing communities that wanted to build onshore wind farms to do so.\nHe said: \u201cWhat on earth is the government doing, saying that even where a community wants to have an onshore wind farm, it can\u2019t have it. This is sheer dogma.\u201d\nYet, the opposite is true: the Government has devolved the decision to approve onshore wind turbines to local councils.\nWind developers know full well that their projects are very unpopular with local people. That, and the crucial consideration that there are no more subsidies available, accounts for the fact that there are only a very small number of onshore wind projects in the planning system at present.\nIn its ruling, Dominic Groves, Deputy Head of the BBC\u2019s Executive Complaints Unit, said Lord Deben\u2019s claim \u201cdoes not appear to be supported by the evidence\u201d.\nHe went on to say: \u201cLord Deben was presented as someone with a significant degree of expertise and knowledge in this area \u2026 I think he should have been challenged on this point to ensure listeners were not left with a materially misleading impression.\u201d\nLord Deben also claimed that onshore wind power was the \u201ccheapest form of producing electricity today\u201d.

Backed by Bernie Sanders and NBA superstar LeBron James, the bill allows college athletes in the state to profit from their image and likeness.\nThe bill comes one year after the NCAA, the largest governing body for college sports in the United States, reportedly amassed $1.1bn in revenue. Most of this money comes from the men\u2019s basketball March Madness tournament, according to CNBC, and a large portion also comes from college football bowl games. Although the Fair Pay to Play Act would not force the NCAA to pay athletes for any of those tournament, it will allow them to do paid public appearances, sign endorsement deals, offer private lessons and sell their memorabilia.\nThe act is a sign of progress but it will only apply to a select few: while high-profile football and basketball players from successful programs are marketable, most student athletes are not famous enough to warrant endorsement deals or a market in signed memorabilia. However, when it comes to college athletics, there is a far larger issue that is being ignored: its actual price tag and who funds its existence.\nThe notion that all college sports teams across the United States are generating millions of dollars for their respective schools and every NCAA athlete is being exploited is unfounded. Except for some elite football and men\u2019s basketball programs, expenses tend to outstrip revenues, and the burden is largely placed on non-athletes, driving up the cost of their degrees.\nThe cost of college athletics varies greatly from school to school and oftentimes depends on which one of the three NCAA Divisions a school is in. The elite Division I teams (except for Ivy League schools) are allowed to offer full athletic scholarships to players, Division II teams primarily offer their athletes partial scholarships while Division III teams cannot offer athletic scholarships at all, according to Prep Scholar.\nThe NCAA reported in 2016 that the average Division I school lost $12.6m annually on athletics if they don\u2019t have a football team, and $14.4m if they do. In Division II, the annual loss per school as of 2014 was $5.1m if they had a football team and $4.1m if they did not. For Division III, football schools lost $3.1m on athletics while those without football experienced a $1.6m loss.\nLargely, student fees and hiked tuition subsidize these costs at smaller private universities, although taxpayers contribute at state government-operated public colleges. Even so, a 2010 Washington Post report revealed that nine public colleges in Virginia charged each student more than $1,000 annually in fees to fund their athletic department.\nThe alternative to hiking fees is to cut sports teams entirely, which is exactly what Bacone College and Malone University have done in recent years. \nMalone, a small private Christian school in Ohio with approximately 1,600 students, decided to cut the school\u2019s Division II football team to make additional funding available for academics. The school\u2019s official website reports they will save approximately $1m annually by cutting football. Recently, the school added cybersecurity and criminal and restorative justice programs.\nMeanwhile, when Ferlin Clark became the president of Oklahoma\u2019s Bacone College in 2018, he cut his school\u2019s NAIA (a smaller NCAA alternative) football and rodeo programs to help erase $2m in debt and redirect funds towards the classroom.\nClark, who did not reply to requests from the Guardian for this story, explained his rationale to KTUL in 2018. \u201cI think the core of it is we became a sports institute rather than an academic institution, and we had 16 athletic programs rather than 13 academic programs, so we needed to realign who we really are,\u201d he said.\nAlthough financial woes forced Malone University and Bacone College to admit athletics drained resources, they are in the minority. At other schools like the University of Houston and UC Santa Cruz, students have voted in recent years in favor of increasing their own tuition fees to subsidize their athletic departments\nOftentimes, colleges mislead on the fiscal burden sports present because schools include subsidies to their athletic department as revenue on their financial reports. In 2018 USA Today Sports compiled financial reports from 230 public colleges\u2019 athletic departments and in their explanation of the revenue column, they noted student fees, tuition and state funds were being counted. On financial reports, this makes it appear as though the athletic departments are self-sufficient or even making money for their respective schools when they are not.\nStill, college sports are not going away anytime soon. In 2019, there were five new college football programs established and in 2020, there will be four more, none of which will be Division I, according to Next College Student Athlete.\nEven though elite college athletes could soon be profiting from their efforts, there is no foreseeable legislation to help out the millions of non-athlete students caught in this unrelated \u2013 yet far more prevalent \u2013 issue.", "label": 0}, "text-52": {"text": "Sajid Javid resignation: how ex-chancellor rose through Tory ranks\nSajid Javid\u2019s promotion as chancellor was a significant moment for the Conservative party and the prime minister\u2019s \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d as he became the first person from a Muslim background to occupy the role.\nHis rise through the party after an 18-year career in banking, where he was a managing director at Deutsche Bank, was rapid. After being elected as MP for Bromsgrove in the West Midlands in 2010, he served in the coalition government as economic secretary to the treasury, then financial secretary.\nHis first secretary of state position was culture secretary, following the resignation of Maria Miller over her expenses in 2014. This made him the first British-Pakistani MP to lead a Whitehall department.\nIn 2015, he was appointed business secretary. A crisis moment came just a year later when he was ordered to return from a holiday in Australia with his daughter in the midst of the Redcar steel crisis, which led to the loss of thousands of jobs. Yet he kept his position and headed into the EU referendum as a remain supporter though a known Eurosceptic.\nIn the aftermath of Cameron\u2019s resignation, he ran on a joint leadership ticket with the then work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, who was considered a rising star in the party. With Javid as his chancellor, Crabb said the pair best represented blue-collar conservatism as they came from modest working-class backgrounds compared to then challengers Theresa May and Boris Johnson. The leadership ambition was dashed when they came fourth in the first round of voting.\nUnder Theresa May, Javid had some quieter years as housing secretary before being promoted to home secretary following the departure of Amber Rudd in the wake of the Windrush scandal. He was the first BAME person to ever hold the position and spoke movingly about how he was \u201ccommitted to right the wrongs of successive governments\u201d on the treatment of people from the Caribbean. He also publicly apologised to the victims.\nHe finally achieved his long-standing ambition of becoming chancellor in Johnson\u2019s government in July 2019 after getting knocked out of the leadership race in the the middle of the contest, coming behind Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.\nJust eight months later, he has quit the government without even delivering his first budget, allegedly taking a stand over the treatment of his staff who were threatened with the sack. This is not the first time staffing issues have played out in public. In August 2019, his adviser Sonia Khan was fired on the spot by Dominic Cummings over alleged contact with the previous chancellor Phillip Hammond.\nIn the Johnson era, where there is frequent talk of the \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d and the \u201cpeople\u2019s cabinet\u201d, Javid was emblematic of a more diverse Tory party that welcomes and promotes non-white politicians who did not attend Britain\u2019s top public schools.\nA source close to the former chancellor and home secretary told the Guardian he was \u201ca family man with a good sense of humour\u201d, adding he was \u201csomeone who knew how to run government departments and get the best out of policy officials, making them think outside of box\u201d. He was \u201calways across his brief\u201d and \u201crelated to people on a human level, always thanking staff for their hard work\u201d, the source said.\nDuring his tenure as home secretary, Javid struck a more personal note in speeches and interviews. Perhaps looking ahead to his eventual leadership bid, he would frequently allude to his family as a great source of pride.\nDiscussing the plight of the Windrush generation when he oversaw the government response to the crisis, he candidly revealed his first reaction was \u201cit could have been my parents\u201d.\nHowever, he faced an uncomfortable moment when it was drawn to his attention that the immigration changes he unveiled in late September 2018 to clampdown on \u201clow skilled migration\u201d would have most likely prohibited his own parents from travelling to the UK had they applied in the 1960s.\nAnd on crime policing \u2013 another significant policy area under his brief \u2013 he would regularly make much of the fact he was raised on a street in Bristol once called by the Sun as the \u201cmost dangerous street in Britain\u201d.\nHis brother, Basit Javid, a senior-ranking police officer with West Midlands police, regularly made his way into Javid\u2019s speeches, particularly when addressing the policing community, drawing on his brother\u2019s experience and counsel.\nTwo months into his term as home secretary, his eldest brother, Tariq Javid, tragically died.\nJavid was born in Rochdale after his family moved there from Pakistan in the 1960s. His father worked as a bus driver and his mother was a seamstress.\nHis parents and four brothers later moved to Bristol, where they ran a shop, and he went to the local comprehensive school and college for his A-levels. He studied economics and politics at the University of Exeter and attended his first Conservative party conference aged 20 in 1990.\nIn a moving interview about his background with the Evening Standard last autumn, he spoke of how his parents\u2019 shop was often the target of racist attacks.\n\u201cIt was sprayed with the word \u2018Paki\u2019 on the window about five or six times,\u201d he said, \u201cand I would feel so sorry for my mum who would have to take it off.\u201d\nIn September 2019, his mother, Zubaida, attended the Tory party conference.

He complained of severe headaches and began to suffer paranoia and delusional beliefs.\nOn 23 May 2017 Cole, from Falmouth in Cornwall, took cocaine and, thinking people were out to \u201cget\u201d him, picked up a kitchen knife.\nPolice arrived and Cole, a painter and decorator, suffered a cardiac arrest after being Tasered three times for a total of 43 seconds.\nSince then his family, while struggling with grief, have worked hard to get answers about the events leading up to the death of the 30-year-old.\nThey were alarmed to discover that the officer who Tasered Cole did not at first admit that he had activated his device three times, and believe police do not have sufficient training on how to deal with people suffering a mental health crisis.\nCole\u2019s sister Lisa Cole said: \u201cAs family we were hoping we would get clarification about those minutes leading up to Marc\u2019s death.\u201d\nBut she said conflicting accounts of what had happened meant that the full picture remains unclear. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening, an insult to Marc\u2019s suffering and to Marc\u2019s family. If you have officers who aren\u2019t being straightforward and transparent that leads to lack of accountability. If there\u2019s a lack of accountability lessons will not be learned.\n\u201cWe would like an urgent review around the Tasering of vulnerable people. We would like a review at the use of multiple Tasering. The training around Tasering vulnerable people seems very sparse.\u201d\nLisa, who was a mental health practitioner and is currently retraining to become a counsellor-psychotherapist, said her brother was gentle and family-orientated.\n\u201cMarc was a warm and straightforward young man,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had a heart of gold. He would do anything for anyone. People wanted to be around Marc and he lived for his two young children. The small moments with them made him very happy.\n\u201cHe nursed dad through terminal cancer from start to end. I think that was the beginning of the end for Marc \u2013 he unravelled afterwards. There\u2019s a history of bipolar in the family. I think that was what Marc was contending with.\u201d\nOn the day of his death, Cole went to a friend\u2019s home. He had a kitchen knife which friends have described him as holding as if ready to defend himself. At about 9pm, he jumped or fell out of his friend\u2019s home through a first-floor window.\nHe went into a neighbour\u2019s garden and caught her with the knife, causing a superficial injury to her leg in what appeared to be an accident.\nOther neighbours saw Marc wandering in the street. One witness said he looked like a \u201clost soul\u201d. A woman walking home from work called the police non-emergency number, 101. Asked why she didn\u2019t call 999, she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel threatened by Marc.\u201d\nThe police arrived and ordered Cole to drop the knife. He began to self-harm and PC Timothy Wilson discharged his Taser. A witness said: \u201cThe sound of it was horrendous. It\u2019s a sound I never want to hear again. You could hear the electricity running through it.\u201d\nCole was hit by the Taser three times for a total of 43 seconds. A second officer used his baton to strike the knife out of Cole\u2019s hand. Cole was handcuffed and shouted for his mother, asking: \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\nWhen paramedics arrived there was confusion, as they had been called to attend to the woman who had been cut with the knife. Cole lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest.\nDuring the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, Wilson admitted giving inaccurate initial statements about how many times he had activated the Taser. He said he was acting on legal advice.\nWilson said he feared for his own safety and said Cole was holding the knife to his own throat and seemed determined to cause himself an injury. \u201cIt was clear I needed to do something,\u201d Wilson said.\nLisa said: \u201cMarc was clearly urgently needing help. He was confused disorientated, suffering psychosis. He suffered 43 seconds of Tasering at a time he was scared and delusional. His brain would have been racing.\u201d\nCole\u2019s death came five years after that of Thomas Orchard, a 32-year-old caretaker with mental health issues, who died after being restrained by Devon and Cornwall officers while he was suffering a crisis.\nIn 2019, the Office of the chief constable for Devon and Cornwall was found guilty of a breach of health and safety law over Orchard\u2019s death. The force has said it has learned lessons about how to deal with people in a mental health crisis, but Lisa Cole said it appeared the training \u201cstill isn\u2019t robust or thorough enough\u201d.\nThe three years since Cole\u2019s death have been very difficult for the family. \u201cIt\u2019s been three long years,\u201d said Lisa. \u201cThat\u2019s really hard. In that time you are gagged, you don\u2019t really have a voice. You are marginalised as a family.\n\u201cIf the police had said: \u201cWe panicked \u2013 in Cornwall we don\u2019t see this a lot,\u2019 I would have had more respect for them and understood.

Some 15.5% of the local population have been diagnosed with depression compared with an England average of 9.8%; 11.8% of adults are obese (England: 9.7%); 7.7% have diabetes (England: 6.7%); 14.7% have high blood pressure (England: 13.8%) and 2.8% have one of the progressive lung diseases known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (England: 1.9%).\nPainter and decorator Alexander Muresan has a lung condition and COPD. The 46-year-old lives in Middleton, a town in the south of the constituency, and needs regular medical attention. \u201cI think people here always think they are overlooked in comparison to the south. People think London comes first and we get the trickle after. At most doctors you feel like they want you in and out the door.\u201d\nMore than a quarter of adults (26.5%) in Rochdale, the local authority area, are classed as \u201cphysically inactive\u201d, compared with the England average of 22.2%. Poor public transport means most people drive rather than use public transport: most of the constituency is nowhere near a tram or train stop and buses are slow and expensive. Middleton lost its railway station in the 1960s and despite being just six miles from central Manchester now feels a bit isolated.\nDeprivation plays a big role in ill-health: 21% of Heywood and Middleton is classed as \u201chighly deprived\u201d, compared with 0% of Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. At Middleton\u2019s shopping centre, the Lighthouse Project community hub operates a busy food bank as well as the Pantry club, where members pay \u00a33.50 a week for ten food items worth around \u00a315, plus a selection of fresh fruit and veg.\nMargaret White, 65, volunteers there and says many in the area have fallen on hard times. \u201cThis used to be a prosperous place with lots of manufacturing and now lots of those jobs have now gone. People now, if they want a good job, have to go into Manchester. This has led to more unemployment. Poor transport as well, a lot of people can\u2019t get to the jobs, we have poor transport links, particularly the bus services are bad, which makes people deprived,\u201d she says.\nLife expectancy in the north has increased far slower than in the south. Between 1991 and 1993, men in Rochdale were expected to live on average to 71.4 \u2013 not too dissimilar from in Kensington and Chelsea in London, where male life expectancy then was 73. Now, the average man in the London borough will now live to 83.3 while his Rochdale counterpart will die at 77.2.\nMuresan was surprised to hear the statistics. \u201cYou\u2019d think it\u2019d be the opposite, with more pollution in London you\u2019d think they\u2019d have the lower life expectancy. I\u2019ve been to London a few times and everyone is always running and no one looks like they have a minute to spare and up here, up north, is a bit more laid back,\u201d he says.\nAisha Connor, 48, a care assistant, says she thinks healthcare needs better funding locally. \u201cA lot of our patients don\u2019t get the drugs they need because they cost too much money so they just leave them.

All this talk about rising sea levels \u2013 most of us old-timers haven\u2019t seen any change and we\u2019ve been coming down here for decades.\u201d\nTake that, science!\nThis week we were reminded just how little conservative media and political parties have progressed in that time.\nA wasted decade of inaction for which all blame can be laid at the feet of editors of newspapers who have chosen to pursue conspiracy theory and ignorance over facts, and a political party happy to feed off and accentuate the results of that ignorance.\nThis week the Australian featured again a story suggesting fears about climate change were all for naught. This time the issue was the Great Barrier Reef and, wouldn\u2019t you know, it all is fine.\nWas this a report of a new study? Was it reporting of extensive research of the reef done by its environment reporter?\nOf course not.\nIt was an article citing Sussan Ley, who, laughably, is Australia\u2019s environment minister. Ley, after going for a snorkel on the reef out of Cairns, told the Australian that \u201cI was expecting to see dead areas with a few patches of life. I saw the exact opposite to that.\u201d She suggested \u201cIt gives me heart and hope that the future of this magnificent part of the world is a good one.\u201d\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLey is not the first federal parliamentarian to think that one snorkel on the reef is enough to dispute scientific reports on the devastation that is climate change.\nPauline Hanson did the same thing in 2016.\nYes, our environment minister is now someone who is basically mimicking Pauline Hanson, where anecdote is trumping science.\nPerhaps she could read the position statement by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which notes that \u201cthe widespread impacts of climate change are already evident. In the northern two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park there were two consecutive years of mass coral bleaching and mortality in 2016 and 2017 with associated loss of marine life\u201d.\nIt also notes that \u201cclimate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. If we are to secure a future for the Great Barrier Reef and coral reef ecosystems globally, there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\nAt the same time this week, the prime minister was in Tuvalu at the Pacific Island Forum, doing all he could to ensure the issue of climate change was being fobbed off \u2013 by reportedly trying (and failing) to remove mention of climate change \u201ccrisis\u201d and also removing mention of coal in the forum communiqu\u00e9.\nPerhaps this should not surprise us, but that does not mean we should accept it with a shrug. For just as Alan Jones\u2019s vile misogyny, ignorance and lies on climate change , also on display this week, should not go uncriticised (even though we expect no better from him), we must continue to push for our government to acknowledge reality and then work to do something about it.\nBecause while our conservative media and government is ignoring the issue, our major institutions are not.\nThis week the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Guy Debelle, gave a speech specifically about risks to the economy at the 14th Annual Risk Australia conference. He devoted one section to \u201cclimate risk\u201d, in which he told the audience of risk managers \u201cto take appropriate account of one risk that plays out over a longer horizon, namely climate risk.\u201d\nHe also advised that \u201cclimate is a challenging risk to assess but an increasingly necessary one. Businesses need to take account of both the physical risks and the transition risks\u201d.\nHe referenced information released this week by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which noted its regulatory guidance for company directors was to \u201cadopt a probative and proactive approach to emerging risks, including climate risk\u201d and \u201cdisclose meaningful and useful climate risk related information to investors\u201d.\nSuch bodies don\u2019t do these things for laughs or to please the greenies. They do it because they know climate change is real and that companies that ignore it could be held liable in the future.\nIt is why reinsurers (companies that underwrite insurance firms) very much take climate change into account. Earlier this year the world\u2019s largest reinsurer, Munich Re, warned that the cost of insurance in areas likely to be affected by the impact of climate change \u2013 whether it be flooding, bushfire or increased hurricanes and cyclones \u2013 would cause them to have to increase their risk prices, which in turn could mean that \u201csome people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance\u201d.\nI can understand the government wanting to reassure people that there is still coral to see on the reef. But let\u2019s not treat those same people like idiots.\nMajor businesses and institutions know the science is real and are acting accordingly. The people who live in the Pacific islands know only too well the reality of the science.\nAnd yet our government, hand-in-hand with the editorial policies of major conservative media, remains wilfully ignorant.\nAfter more than a decade we may expect such ignorance, but we must never accept it.\n\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia\n\u2022 This article was amended on 19 August to clarify that Gay Debelle gave the speech at the 14th Annual Risk Australia conference.

Much of this warming is due to what is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect: bitumen, tall-buildings, air-conditioners, and fewer and fewer trees, means that urban areas become hotter and hotter.\nFor example, in a recent study of temperature variability and change for south-east Australia it is evident that maximum temperatures in the cities of Melbourne and Hobart are increasing at a rate of about 0.8 degree Celsius per century; while the rate of increase at the nearby lighthouses is half of this.\nWhile the trend of about 0.4 degree Celsius per century at the lighthouses \u2013 as shown in Chart 1 \u2013 is arguably an accurate record of temperature change, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology changes this. To be clear, the Bureau changes a perfectly good temperature series from Cape Otway lighthouse by remodeling it so that it has Melbourne\u2019s temperature signal \u2013 all through the process of homogenisation.\nGovernment agencies in the USA have done exactly the same thing to temperature records for Colorado.  This is all explained in detail in this new video by Monte Naylor:\nhttps://vimeo.com/196878603/b9ea716a74\nThe video runs for about 40 minutes, and is quite technical.\nThe conclusions from this study have been summarized by Monte as follows:\n(1)\u00a0The USHCN Fort Collins station temperature record was not recognized by NOAA as having the heat bias from expanding UHI which has been easily identified by other researchers.\n(2)\u00a0NOAA\u2019s homogenization program adjusted the USHCN Boulder station temperature history in a fashion that does not match any of the four other nearby rural/suburban long-term temperature histories. Nor does the NOAA-homogenized Boulder temperature history resemble the average temperature trend found by this study.\n(3)\u00a0NOAA\u2019s homogenization program adjusted the Boulder temperature history to resemble the UHI-contaminated temperature history of the Fort Collins station.\n(4)\u00a0The best estimate of the northern Colorado Front Range temperature trend is obtained by using the TOB-adjusted Group of 5 average which shows a warming temperature trend of 1.7 \u00b0F (0.95 \u00b0C) from 1900 to 2015. The NOAA temperature trend, about 4 \u00b0F over 115 years, is more than twice the best estimate of this study.\n(5)\u00a0About 70% of the warming shown in the Group of 5 average temperature trend occurred before 1932. Temperatures trends of recent decades do not show anomalous warming.\u00a0 Distinct warm temperature events occurred in the 1930\u2019s and 1950\u2019s that were much warmer than those observed since the turn of the 21st\u00a0century.", "label": 1}, "text-60": {"text": "what controls earth's climate?  it's the sun, stupid!\nIn this important paper, German scientist Uili Kulke, quotes Henrik Svensmark, head of solar research at Denmark\u2019s Technical University in Copenhagen: \u201cThe climate is influenced more by changes in cosmic radiation than by carbon dioxide\u201d.

A key point made by Dr Ridd this morning is that there is absolutely no quality assurance of Great Barrier Reef research \u2013 research that they report on almost daily.\nChanges in temperature, acidity, and also turbidity (muddiness) are consequences of physical processes. Yet the media mostly interview biologists who assume changes, without actually measuring them and then set about establishing effects in fish tanks.\nOcean acidification, for example, is an area of research where, in less than 20 years, the number of published papers has increased from zero to 800 each year.   Sometimes the biologists have even added hydrochloric acid to artificially reduce the pH of the water in their fish tanks to mimic what their computer simulation models have determined must surely be our dystopian future.  The media headlines then incorrectly report the result as the current situation at The Great Barrier Reef \u2013 this makes for more and more fake news.\nMeanwhile, physicist Peter Ridd has been studying and measuring actual changes at the Great Barrier Reef for more than 35 years \u2013 contributing to a deeper understanding of many of the most important physical processes.\nFor example, if we are to measure the impact of sugarcane farming then we need to know how much muddier reef waters are now, relative to before European settlement.\nIn the wake of the very high-profile launch of the WWF Save the Reef Campaign back in June 2001, there was a flurry of newspaper articles. They reported that sediment was literally smothering the corals of the Great Barrier Reef.  Yet there was no evidence for this beyond some fake photographs that were exposed yesterday in the Federal Court by Peter Ridd\u2019s Barrister, Stuart Wood QC.  You can see these photographs in my last blog post.\nOver the years many biologists have been claiming that muddiness (caused by excess sediments) is a problem, and yet no one from the Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University has been interviewed about this.  At this laboratory there are physicists studying ocean tides, currents, waves and their effect on the concentration and distribution of the sediments, which are supposedly causing the problem.\nPeter Ridd joined the laboratory in 1989, as one of the first four post-doctoral fellows employed there. He is the only one to survive several decades as an academic at James Cook University, being promoted to Professor in 2008 and becoming the Head of Physics in the same year.\nProfessor Ridd began his career undertaking detailed measurements of turbidity with different instruments. He was interested in how to measure the advection of sediment (mud) and its resuspension by wave generated shear stresses.  This requires an understanding of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and wave theory.  So obsessed was he with the accuracy of these measurements that he invented new equipment so that more accurate measurements of turbidity (muddiness) could be recorded under the variety of different natural conditions \u2013 considering the vastness of the reef.\nOnce Peter Ridd had mastered this, he moved on to understand in more detail how sediments potentially carry pollutants, including fertilizers and pesticides, from farmland into reef waters. He was most interested in how these pollutants could potentially be mixed through turbulent diffusion and dilution, which are also complex physical processes.\nHe has also studied temperatures: heat fluxes from the sun, infrared radiation from the surface (Stefan Boltzmann Law), evaporative fluxes and latent, vertical mixing of hot water into the water column by waves (another physical mechanism).  These processes are now well documented including in some of his over 110 scientific publications.\nIt is now understood how pH (acidity) varies on a daily, seasonal and inter-annual basis, including with large fluctuations in temperature that is common across bodies of water, and also with water depth.  Yet the experiments in fish tanks, which some biologists persist with, fail to incorporate this variability into their design, or the interpretation of results.\nThe Great Barrier Reef is a vast and complex ecosystem.  It is the case that the considerable daily variations in temperatures, pH and turbidity from natural processes still dwarf any measurable human impact.  While there are trends of increasing water temperature and pH at some locations, it is unclear to what extent these longer-term trends are part of existing natural cycles.\nPeter Ridd\u2019s life\u2019s work has been focused on understanding real physical processes in extreme detail.  In all of this, his interest has been on understanding the potential impacts of human activity on biological processes.\nOne of his most recent peer-reviewed publication is entirely about a biological phenomenon: coral calcification rates.  He measured coral extension and density and determined that corals like it hot!\nIt is a fact that most species of coral that live on the Great Barrier Reef also live in much warmer waters, closer to the Equator around Indonesia and Thailand.  Coral growth rates are closely linked to temperature, and both appear to have increased ever so slightly at the Great Barrier Reef over the last 100 years.  This is good news \u2013 unreported.  The increase in growth rates may all be part of a natural cycle, or there may be an anthropogenic (human-cause) effect linked to global warming.\nPeter Ridd has been keen to find a human-impact in the many and varied research projects that he has been involved with, many including biologists.  If he had found a negative impact, he would no doubt still have a job doing what he is best at \u2013 teaching, and scientific research.  But science is currently funded and reported in such a way that inconvenient facts are ignored while Dr Ridd who has persisted with the truth \u2013 explaining that The Great Barrier Reef is healthy and reef research has no proper quality controls \u2013 finds himself in a law court and fighting for his job back.\n*****\nGideon Rozner is tweeting live from the Court: https://mobile.twitter.com/GideonCRozner\nIf you would like to read an update from me later today/tonight subscribe for my e-news: https://jennifermarohasy.com/subscribe/\nYou will get more, and different news at: https://ipa.org.au/peterridd\nThe research projects detailed in this article can be explored in more detail at ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Ridd", "label": 1}, "text-62": {"text": "School climate strikers join Valentine's Day protests across world\nStriking students have joined Valentine\u2019s Day rallies across the world as the protest movement attempts to ratchet up pressure on governments and companies before crunch UN climate talks in Glasgow later this year.\nIn London, the young demonstrators held banners proclaiming \u201cRoses are red, violets are blue, our Earth is burning and soon we will too\u201d and \u201cClimate change is worse than homework\u201d as they marched through Parliament Square on Friday to mark the first anniversary of nationwide climate strikes in the UK.\nStudents in Durham, Glasgow, Brighton and dozens of other cities also braved often wet and cold condition to march through the streets chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now.\u201d\nGreta Thunberg, who initiated the movement as a solitary striker in Stockholm in August 2018, said climate strikes were planned in 2,000 cities across the world on Friday, and that bigger actions were planned for the coming months.\nIn many countries, the protests have expanded to include local environmental concerns, new strategies and stronger emphasis on global climate justice.\nIn India on Friday, strikers turned their focus on government plans to deforest swathes of the Aravallis mountain range, which is a conservation area that provides freshwater and oxygen for Delhi and other cities. Some carried banners in English reading: \u201cI love Aravallis\u201d, \u201cOur green lungs\u201d and \u201cProtectors are turning destroyers\u201d.\nIn Sydney, climate strikers demonstrated with banners that depicted the devastating bushfires and blamed the government of Scott Morrison for the \u201cclimate chaos\u201d that has hit Australia. In the Philippines, climate strikers organised an educational storytelling campaign to raise public awareness.\nIn Scotland, Holly Gillibrand, who was one of the first strikers in the UK when she started a vigil outside Lochaber high school in Fort William in the Highlands, said the growth of the movement had been incredible.\n\u201cWhen I began striking over a year ago, Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future [campaign] were not well known at all and I was one of very few strikers in the UK, but since then, everything has changed. The movement has gone from one person to 7.5 million.\n\u201cEven if we still aren\u2019t getting the radical action we need from governments, politicians are feeling the pressure to act and we just need to keep pushing, keep shouting, keep rebelling until they do.\u201d Holly continued her strike on Friday, with a hot chocolate to help get her through the wet weather.\nAmong those striking for the first time on Friday was a group in Rwanda, where protesters tweeted Timages of themselves holding signs that said: \u201cRwanda stand for climate.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s action was not intended as a mega-strike like those in September, when more than 6 million people took part, but it showed how the campaign has evolved.\nMaryam Grassly, 17, who was among the hundreds of strikers in central London, said: \u201cThe most enthusiastic and passionate people have stayed on, and more people have got involved and been inspired by it, but at the same time we\u2019ve lost the people who didn\u2019t really care.\u201d\nBut in her mind there was no question about the relevance of the protest. \u201cWhen the election happened and Boris [Johnson] got voted in I just kind of gave up on the world, I thought that\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the climate emergency and net zero by 2050 but nothing is happening as fast as it should be.\u201d Similarly she was \u201cexcited but worried\u201d about the UK hosting Cop26 later this year, saying the previous conference of the parties in Madrid did not go well.\nBut the protesters were still hopeful about the difference they have made over the past few months.\nMaude Brown, 17, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned about the issue for almost a decade, I was taught about it in year 4, and no one really cared then so I\u2019m happy that everyone is concerned about it now. I think as more politicians from our generation come in we can make a lot of change in the future.\u201d\nMost of the strikers were teenagers, but there were some younger children too.

However, close scrutiny of all the temperature data from the state of Victoria paints quite a different picture.   When all 289 temperature series from Victoria are simply combined, the hottest years are in the early part of the record. In particular, 1914 is very evidently the hottest year on record \u2013 see blue time series in Chart 1.    This finding builds on a recently published book chapter focused on south-east Australia, and is part of a larger study working towards a realistic reconstruction of Australia\u2019s temperature history.\nYesterday the Australian Bureau of Meteorology released its Annual Climate Statement, claiming 2016 to be the fourth-warmest year on record for Australia \u2013 and also an unusually wet year.   Wet years are usually much cooler years, but because the overall trend in the ACORN-SAT* time series shows significant warming, even a wet year comes out as relatively hot.\nOf course there is no one place in Australia where the average temperature can be measured; so the Bureau relies on a reconstruction to determine how hot 2016 was, relative to the historical record.   Their method, however, is quite subjective in terms of choice of locations to include, the method used to remodel the individual temperature series before they are combined (this is refered to as homogenisation*), and the area weighting applied \u2013 with the weighting changing on a daily and monthly basis.\nLate last year, I had a book chapter, co-authored with John Abbot and published by Elsevier*, which shows historical temperature trends for south-east Australia from 1887 to 2013 based on a more transparent system \u2013 that can be easily replicated.    We choose the longest continuous series, used the same series to calculate every value, and applied an area weighting based on topography and landuse \u2013 and did not remodel individual temperature series.   In the chapter we conclude that temperature trends for south-east Australia are best described as showing statistically significant cooling (yes cooling) of 1.5 degree Celsius from 1887 to 1949, followed by warming of nearly 2 degrees Celsius from 1950 to 2013.   The warmest year in this reconstruction is 2007, followed very closely by 1914.\nA colleague at the University of Tasmania, Jaco Vlok, has compared our south-east reconstruction with a reconstruction based on all 289 temperature series for Victoria \u2013 but only from 1910.   The different methodologies used to generate these reconstructions, and also the official ACORN-SAT series for Victoria, which is the series used by the Bureau to calculate the official statistics for Australia, are detailed in Table 1.\nThere is a very high degree of synchrony between the reconstructions, though when all the raw data is simply combined \u2013 Vlok\u2019s approach \u2013 the hottest years are all in the earlier part of the record: 1914 (hottest) followed by 1919, 1921, 1938, 1961 and then 2014.\nPostscript: I have expanded on this analysis in an article just now published by Graham Young at OLO.  Jennifer, Noosa, Monday 9th January, 2017.\n_____\n* ACORN-SAT stands for Australian Climate Australian Climate Observations Reference Network \u2013 Surface Air Temperature\u00a0and is a dataset developed by the Bureau based on a subset of available temperature series, almost all homogenised, and then combined with an area weighting and used to report climate variability and change.  The annual climate statement for 2016, based on this ACORN-SAT dataset, is here:  http://media.bom.gov.au/releases/333/2016-a-year-of-extreme-weather-events/\n* Homogenisation involves changes to measured temperature values ostensibly to correct for non-climatic variables.  These changes to the observational data are quite different from quality assurance.  For example, the need for homogenisation most often results from a \u2018statistical test\u2019 detecting a break point, these breakpoints often occur after a period of missing data.  In response all values preceding the breakpoint are often reduced by a specific amount back to 1910.   The amount by which the measured observational values are reduced is determined through the application of algorithms and calculated relative to what are referred to as \u2018neighbouring\u2019 stations, which may be Urban Heat Island (UHI) effected, and/or located many hundreds of kilometers from the target location.", "label": 1}, "text-64": {"text": "Lighting Up Australia\u2019s Energy Future\nThis article was first published in the December 2017 IPA Review.\nAustralia has some of the most plentiful energy resources in the world. The last two decades, however, have paradoxically seen high and rising energy prices. In just the past decade, Australian electricity prices have increased by 116 per cent. That\u2019s compared with a 26 per cent economy-wide inflation and a 34 per cent increase to average wages.\nAnd according to consulting firm CME Australia, 2017 was the year that Australia became home to a jurisdiction with the highest energy prices in the developed world\u2014South Australia. While NSW, Queensland, and Victoria had the 5th, 7th, and 9th highest prices, respectively. For perspective, electricity costs 47 cents per kWh in South Australia, 39 cents in NSW, 36 cents in Queensland, and 35 cents in Victoria, compared with just 30 cents in the European Union and 16 cents in the United States.\nRising energy prices hurt households. Combined with modest wages growth, higher energy prices have led to a greater share of household disposable income being directed toward paying the bills. The 2017 Finkel Review into the National Energy Market found that a typical low income household is now spending up to 9 per cent of its household income on electricity bills. Due to this, the number of people being disconnected from their energy supply has increased sharply, both in Victoria (140 per cent) and South Australia (122 per cent) over the past six years.\nBut it\u2019s not just households who are feeling the pinch. Small, medium, and large businesses are all struggling to absorb the additional cost of operating. In June of this year a family run recycling business in Kilburn, South Australia, announced it would be closing after 38 years, putting 35 people out of work in a state with the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rate. The trigger? A spike in their monthly electricity bill from $80,000 to $180,000.\nThe recently released Australia Consumer and Competition Authority inquiry into retail electricity pricing gave many other examples, such as a retail grocer reporting a 53 per cent increase in their electricity bill in just one year. Companies in the printing industry saw their annual bills increase by up to 48 per cent. And a winery in South Australia faced a 160 per cent annual increase to their electricity costs.\nThe last two decades have seen a never-ending expansion of government interference in the energy market.\nHigh and rising electricity prices have a knock-on effect through the economy. The World Economic Forum\u2019s latest Global Competitiveness Index found that in just the past year the quality of Australia\u2019s energy supply plummeted from ranking 22nd to 44th out of 137 countries. Businesses see Australia\u2019s energy supply as becoming substantially less reliable\u2014and it is showing. Business investment in Australia as a percentage of GDP is now lower than during the Whitlam years. This ultimately holds back employment growth, productivity, and wages growth.\nGiven these negative economic and social effects, it is worthwhile examining the causes of high energy prices\u2014continued failed government intervention\u2014and the changes we need to make to achieve better policy outcomes, such as getting Australia out of the Paris Climate Agreement and reforming laws that discourage resource development.\nHow did Australia, a country with over 1000 years\u2019 worth of coal, plentiful gas, and 40 per cent of the world\u2019s known uranium deposits, find itself in this situation? The answer is years of repeated failed government interventions under the false pretence that reducing emissions is in our national interest.\nThe original sin of Australia\u2019s energy policy was to embrace emissions reductions as a worthy objective.\nTwo decades ago the Howard Government completely accepted the left-wing orthodoxy on climate change with the release of its climate change strategy, Safeguarding the Future: Australia\u2019s Response to Climate Change. Amongst other measures, the strategy saw the introduction of the first incarnation of the Renewable Energy Target (RET). The RET required electricity retailers to source an additional two per cent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010. A modest intervention, to be sure. But from little things big things grow.\nThe last two decades have seen a never-ending expansion of government interference in the energy market. In 2009, the Rudd government expanded the RET, forcing electricity retailers to acquire 20 per cent of total energy generation from renewables. Aside from the flawed policy objective of lowering emissions, the implementation of the RET was laughable.\nTo provide certainty to industry\u2014that is, a guaranteed market share to rent-seekers\u2014government legislation specified that the Gigawatt hours (gWh) of renewable energy that would be required to meet the 20 per cent objective would be 41,000 gWh. But the bureaucrats got this completely wrong. Rather than 41,000 gWh equating to a 20 per cent energy generation share for renewables, a 2014 review found that, due to energy generation demand being softer than previously expected, 41,000 gWh of renewables would actually result in a 28 per cent renewable share by 2020. In this context the Abbott government reduced the RET to 33,000 gWh by 2020, equating to around a 24 per cent renewable market share.\nA cursory understanding of economist Friedrich Hayek\u2019s \u2018knowledge problem\u2019\u2014that the decentralised nature of information renders top-down decision-making impossible\u2014would have revealed the folly in this approach. Further, this so-called reduction to the RET was still a four percentage point increase on the original policy and, moreover, far inferior to abolition.\nAside from the RET, the last decade has seen a smorgasbord of energy market interventions and regulations. In 2012, the carbon tax was introduced, as was a range of energy efficiency requirements on products such as air-conditioners, fridges, and commercial and residential buildings.\nLathered on top of these federal requirements is an array of interventions by state governments. State-based RETs\u2014which commit to renewable energy generation above the federal scheme \u2013 are currently in place in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and the ACT. In addition, Victoria has a ban on coal seam gas and a moratorium on onshore gas development. Western Australia has banned fracking in the state\u2019s south west and imposed a state-wide moratorium. The Northern Territory also has a moratorium on fracking.\nThis is not to mention the red tape and regulation placed on coal development and extraction. Project proponents face an imposing approvals and assessment processes at both the state and federal level. The Tad\u2019s Corner coal project in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland required 5000 licenses, approvals, and permits for the pre-construction phase alone. The Adani coal and rail project spent seven years in the approvals process, fought more than 10 legal challenges, and had to prepare a 22,000-page environmental impact statement. And the project may still not proceed.\nDespite the Abbott government\u2019s repeal of the carbon tax in 2014, government interventions in the energy market\u2014from broad guarantees to piles of compliance on exploration\u2014have consistently pushed coal out of the market to make way for renewables. And because renewables are more expensive and less reliable, prices have risen while reliability has dropped.\nThis brings us to the federal government\u2019s most recent intervention. The so-called National Energy Guarantee (NEG) is an exemplar of short-sighted, complicated, and clumsy public policy. There are two components to the NEG: the reliability guarantee and the emissions guarantee. The emissions guarantee will require electricity retailers to purchase a certain amount of low-emission energy, which will mostly come from renewables, with some room for \u2018clean\u2019 coal. The reliability guarantee will require retailers to purchase an offsetting amount of energy from coal, gas, or renewables with battery storage.\nThe emissions guarantee is predicated on Australia meeting its Paris Climate Agreement requirement to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. You might at this point be questioning what the difference is between the NEG and all of the other policies which required renewable energy usage to reduce emissions. The answer is that there is none.\nAs mentioned above, the RET forced energy retailers to purchase a certain amount of energy from renewable sources, which has the effect of punishing coal and subsidising renewables.\nEarlier in 2017 a Clean Energy Target was briefly considered by government and then discarded. It would have forced retailers to purchase a certain amount of energy from low-emissions sources, such as renewables, at the expense of coal.\nSimilarly, the Emissions Intensity Scheme, also briefly considered and then discarded a year earlier than the CET in 2016, would have forced electricity retailers to source energy from low carbon intensive sources, again shifting the energy mix from coal to renewables.\nThe carbon tax punished high-emissions technology, such as coal, and favoured low-emissions technology, such as renewables. The NEG will also force energy retailers to meet emissions reductions targets, again forcing a shift from coal to renewables.\u00a0There is a common theme underwriting all of these failed interventions: the plainly false idea that it\u2019s in Australia\u2019s national interests to have a policy that explicitly seeks to lower carbon emissions.\nThe IPA\u2019s recent book Climate Change: The Facts 2017 outlines some of the errors in climate science and the ways in which the extent and consequences of climate change and global warming have been overstated. Aside from these important criticisms lies the inescapable policy reality: Australia accounts for just 1.5 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Australia could completely de-industrialise, and end all manufacturing and energy-intensive industry for no noticeable impact on the global temperature.\nThe futility of Australia\u2019s emissions reductions efforts is immediately apparent from the data. According to the International Energy Agency, approximately 400 billion tonnes of carbon were emitted globally from fuel combustion from 2001-14. Over the same period the Climate Council of Australia, a renewable energy lobby group, estimated the RET reduced emissions by just 22.5 million tonnes. This means the RET resulted in 0.005 per cent fewer carbon emissions globally over a 14-year period. This is the equivalent of a reduction of 0.0004 per cent per year on average, equating to effectively no change to global temperatures. It is simply not in Australia\u2019s national interest to have an energy policy predicated on emissions reductions.\nThe bad news is that repeated failures by state and federal, Labor and Coalition, governments have led to Australia\u2019s energy crises. The good news is that the crises can be resolved with some simple policy reform.\nThe first step is to untether energy policy from emissions reductions requirements. In practice this means following the United States and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.\nThe second step is for state and federal governments to deregulate the coal and gas sectors. This means removing bans and moratoria on onshore and offshore gas development and making a number of changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) 1999. Ideally, the EPBC Act would be abolished and responsibility for environmental protection would be returned to the state governments.\nIf the EPBC Act remains, we should abolish section 487 which enables green \u2018lawfare\u2019, remove the \u2018water trigger\u2019 and nuclear actions as matters of national environmental significance, and re-introduce the one-stop-shop process which enables states to assess and approve proposed projects\nThe third step is for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) formula to be radically reformed. GST administration may seem a world away from energy policy, but they are actually closely linked. The current GST formula redistributes income between states based on revenue raising capacity. But revenue raising capacity is partly determined by the policies implemented by state governments, and policies which restrict coal and gas development and favour renewables reduce economic growth and, in doing so, reduce potential revenue. In this way the current GST system favours state governments which discourage development of their natural resources. Hence, the current GST system should be replaced with one that doesn\u2019t discourage economic reform. This could be achieved by allowing the state governments to keep the revenue they raise, or distribute the GST on a per-capita basis. Either approach would be vastly superior to the current approach.\nWe should be optimistic about the prospects of reform.\nJust a few years ago it was unthinkable that a government led by Tony Abbott could repeal the carbon tax. Belief in action on global warming is still in vogue, but less so than a decade ago. And the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Climate Agreement, the ongoing investment in coal by the Chinese, along with Australia\u2019s continuing energy crises, will create the conditions at home for true leadership to emerge and end two decades of energy folly.\nA PDF of the article as it appeared in the IPA Review can be downloaded here.", "label": 1}, "text-65": {"text": "Morning mail: Greens put climate change front and centre\nGood morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 3 September.\nThe Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, is putting climate change front and centre in a speech committing his party to cooperating with Labor and turfing out a government that \u201cdon\u2019t deserve to govern\u201d.

Really?  Hotter than 1905 or even 1938 \u2013 those were hot years in Mildura.\nExtreme heat in inland Australia is usually associated with prolonged drought. But this year there is water in the Murray River; further, modern Mildura is generally considered up to half a degree cooler on average than before the widespread development of irrigation \u2013 back in the 1930 and 1940s, for example, drought really was the norm, along with rabbit plagues and dust storms.\nI wrote to Minister Josh Frydenberg earlier in the week explaining that these new record hot days are unlikely to withstand scrutiny \u2013 for Mildura or anywhere else.  My letter included a fair amount of technical detail, and a request for data to enable a direct comparison of temperature measurements from the old-style mercury thermometers with the new style electronic probes in automatic weather stations (AWS) \u2013 letter attached.\nIn the case of Mildura, the current AWS electronic probe was installed on 27th June 2012 \u2013 the last official measurement from a mercury thermometer at Mildura was actually on 31st October 1996.  Assuming a time constant of 18 seconds for the current probe and given the Bureau\u2019s current method of only taking one-second readings (i.e. taking spot readings \u2013 rather than averaging over at least one minute in accordance with World Meteorological guidelines), then the recent record hot day for Mildura is probably only comparable to measurements taken back to September 2012 (last 5 years), perhaps back to 1996 (last 21 years) \u2013 certainly not back to 1889 as claimed by the Bureau and reported in The Age.\nMinister Frydenberg has been kind enough to acknowledge receipt of my letter, but he doesn\u2019t seem to get how important sorting out the mess that is the Bureau of Meteorology actually is.  He has suggested that we meet in a few weeks, when he is not so busy as he is at the moment.   Of course, Ministers are always busy \u2013 what gets done depends on what they choose to make a priority.\nI am writing to you now because you have been so effective in the past at getting some things done.  For example, after you interviewed me on Wednesday 26 July about the Thredbo weather station and the artificial limits the Bureau had imposed on the measurement of cold temperatures:  the very next day \u2013 after 10 long years of the imposition of these limits \u2013 they were lifted at Thredbo.\nPerhaps, you could invite me back onto your program to discuss this issue of faux hot day records?\nThis is the first time I have actually requested to come on your program.  As those close to me know, I usually don\u2019t sleep the night before such a radio or television interview \u2013 because I find it all so frightening.  I much prefer to analyse data alone, write technical papers with colleagues, and go canoeing with just nature.\nPerhaps just writing this letter to you, and posting it at my blog with be enough?\nYou could perhaps interview Craig Kelly MP instead \u2013 because he is across this issue.  I see that Steve Price has been standing-in for you recently: perhaps Steve Price could interview Craig Kelly MP?  You/Steve Price would really only need me if someone from the Bureau was prepared to actually come-on your show \u2013 then I would be keen to come-on and we could have a proper discussion about the myriad of technical issues that need sorting. In the meantime, there really is a need for a few more people to start discussing these issues in general terms \u2013 then the Minister might realise, finally, that there is no need for the average Australian to be paying ever more for their electricity because we may not actually have run-away global warming.\nFor me the overriding issue is the integrity of the historical temperature dataset, specifically the Australian Data Archive for Meteorology (ADAM).   Indeed, I am currently driving my work colleagues mad-with incessant complaints about no-longer being able to trust any of the data from the Bureau of Meteorology.\nPreviously, I\u2019ve complained about the remodelling by the Bureau of the ACORN-SAT dataset, while working with data from ADAM for my rainfall forecasting.  But since discovering the limits on the recording of cold temperatures, and then coincident to this that the Bureau are taking spot-readings rather than averaging \u2013  it all seems more desperate than ever.\nYours sincerely\nDr Jennifer Marohasy\nNoosa, Qld\nCopy:\nCraig Kelly MP\nSteve Price (via Carla Horton)\nJohn Roskam, IPA", "label": 1}, "text-69": {"text": "Boris Johnson is missing in action on his big Brexit day\nJust imagine a country about to take a giant leap into the unknown. A future sold on the basis of promises no one is certain can be kept. Now imagine the person least suitable to be prime minister at this time. A man whose entire career has been built on lies, deceit and self-destruction. A narcissist whose concentration span barely extends to the end of a senten \u2026 On second thoughts, don\u2019t bother. You\u2019ve got him already.\nThere are a couple of ways of interpreting Boris Johnson\u2019s three-minute cameo posted on his Facebook page at 10pm. Neither shows the prime minister in a particularly good light. The first and the most obvious is that Boris really doesn\u2019t give much of a toss. He\u2019s got what he wanted and can now barely be arsed to go through the motions. His usual lethal combination of boredom and terminal laziness.\nAny half-decent prime minister \u2013 and bizarrely, Theresa May now almost falls into this category \u2013 would have realised that Brexit day was a time to really up their game. To make a live, sincere address to the nation. One that properly acknowledged the significance of the occasion. Boris, not so much. He couldn\u2019t trust himself not to screw up a live broadcast \u2013 didn\u2019t he even have a party inside No 10 already arranged? \u2013 so he did a quick pre-record the day before. Nor could he be bothered to do more than scribble down a few thoughts off the top of his head. Would this do? It would have to.\nThe second interpretation is perhaps the more telling. Because there are countless giveaways that Boris is actually embarrassed about what he has done. Think about it this way. How was the prime minister choosing to spend Brexit night? By bunkering down inside No 10 with a handful of staffers while a light show that none of the public were allowed in to see flickered mournfully on the outside of the building.\nHe did so because he didn\u2019t dare show his face \u2013 not even to go on TV \u2013 and take ownership of a Brexit that has been hewn in his own image. Shambolic and a bit clueless. Because deep down Boris has never really been a true believer.\nBrexit was an ill-fitting carapace he had worn to get into power. He\u2019d never really thought anyone would believe the lies he\u2019d told. It was a game that had suddenly become all too real. The fun had stopped but he couldn\u2019t. Now he was expected to take responsibility for what he had done, he just wanted to hide. The mask of denial and self-deception had momentarily slipped and the Supreme Showman was too ashamed to be seen.\nThe handheld hostage video opens with a shot of the No 10 front door, which is as close to reassurance and gravitas as we get. Then we cut to the figure of Boris holed up in a cupboard \u2013 hey, at least it wasn\u2019t a fridge this time \u2013 looking more of a slob than usual. Hair all over the place, eyes a bit bloodshot and a suit that had been thrown on at the last minute. It may have been possible to make less of an effort for one of the most important speeches of his career, but only if he had been sprawled on a wine-stained sofa.\nRight chaps and chapesses, Boris barked with ersatz chumminess, the trademark smirk etched on to his face as his left arm waved up and down uncontrollably. Let\u2019s get this over and done with. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he said. This was a time of celebration for some, anxiety for others and relief for the rest. You can\u2019t help feeling that for Boris alone, Brexit is actually a combination of all three. Though anxiety mainly. He\u2019s not good on keeping his promises.\nBoris muttered a few lazy platitudes about how he was the man to bring the country together. And if you didn\u2019t believe him, you could always buy one of his Boris-as-Britannia themed \u201csod off EU\u201d tea towels from the Conservative party website. A bargain at just \u00a312. \u201cThis is a new beginning,\u201d he said. One of the few accurate statements he made. And one of the most terrifying, because even he has to admit he doesn\u2019t have a clue what comes next.\nTypically, Johnson then lapsed into contradiction and jingoist bullshit. We had outgrown the EU but we could still be really, really good friends with the EU27 provided we remembered not to tell them we think they are a waste of space. And Britain had the best possible future ahead of it. Because \u2026 because we did. We\u2019re Britain and we could do anything. All you had to do was believe. This might have been more convincing if his own expression hadn\u2019t been riddled with self-doubt.\nEr \u2026 Um \u2026 That was about it. He didn\u2019t have anything else to say. And what he had said hadn\u2019t been worth saying. At least not with the lack of interest with which he had said it. At a time of a national identity crisis, the prime minister had gone missing in action. All he had really managed to convey was an indifferent \u201cfuck you\u201d.

After all, and with all due respect to the television channel\u2019s home in Milton Keynes, it is going to a much better place. Just short of its 18th birthday, the adoption papers were signed and approved earlier this year and from Tuesday, it is official. At The Races is part of the Sky Sports \u201cfamily\u201d now.\nThe \u201cAt The Races\u201d name is old enough for a PR executive with political ambitions called David Cameron to have been peripherally involved with the initial launch in 2000, when few could have guessed that he would one day break the country. At the time, the future of horse racing on television was thought to involve, among other things, broadcasting one race a day in the lunchtime slot once inhabited in the 70s by Fred Trueman\u2019s incomparable Indoor League. And unless my memory is playing up, this actually happened, for six months or so, until the concept was gently laid to rest.\nBut as the new year begins on Tuesday, At The Races will finally be consigned to history. In its place: Sky Sports Racing, the youngest member of the squad of channels broadcast from Sky Centre in west London, alongside Sky Sports Premier League, Football, Cricket, Golf, F1 and others that cover multiple sports. Britain\u2019s second-biggest spectator sport \u2013 500,000 paying spectators in front of rugby union at the latest count \u2013 now has a place on Sky to call its own.\nWhat is different about Sky Sports Racing is that it will be available to subscribers to a basic satellite or cable package. Anyone who is used to scrolling past At The Races in search of Dave or Discovery will now find themselves scrolling past Sky Sports Racing instead. The brand will sit there on the electronic programme guide, as a reminder that (some) Premier League football matches and various other delights are also available if you merely agree to part with about \u00a3300 a year.\nBut Sky is not simply putting its name behind the rebranding of a channel in which it already held a significant stake. There is a major investment of money and resources going into the project as well, with some fresh faces among the presenters, the wholesale move to a swanky new studio at Sky Centre, an overdue upgrade to broadcast in HD and plenty of high-end technology on hand to assist with pre- and post-race analysis.\nOf course, broadcasters who are launching \u2013 or relaunching \u2013 their racing coverage always promise to revolutionise the viewing experience with cutting-edge tech. Channel 4 did it, ITV did it and now Sky is doing the same. But having spent five minutes playing around with one of their top-of-the-range video analysis tools during a recent tour of the studios, I can confirm it is a remarkable piece of kit. It is also quick and intuitive to use \u2013 \u201cIf Jamie Carragher can get it, anyone can\u201d was how one producer put it \u2013 and could bring a new level of depth to Sky\u2019s analysis.\nThis could prove to be a genuine competitive advantage in Sky Sports Racing\u2019s long-running domestic rivalry with the subscription-based Racing UK, which will officially rebrand itself as Racing TV (RTV) from Tuesday. The two name-changes on the same day are far from coincidental, as it was RUK\u2019s audacious \u2013 and, arguably, somewhat injudicious \u2013 decision to snatch coverage of Irish racing from ATR that may have stung Sky into action in the first place.\nThe switch of Irish pictures to a subscription channel \u2013 which Irish racing did not want but could do nothing about \u2013 initially seemed to be game over for ATR. RUK\u2019s expectation seems to have been that its long-standing rival would now limp along, hopelessly weakened, or possibly turn up its toes altogether. It was not one of its better predictions. Not only is RTV now facing a rival with an internationally recognised brand and a budget to match, SSR can also expect to benefit from cross-promotional opportunities across the other Sky channels.\nRTV must also try to squeeze live coverage from 26 Irish tracks into its schedule alongside the pictures from its 37 British racecourse shareholders, and keep everyone happy with the height of their profile as they do so. It will not be easy. Irish racing, already suspicious that it has been sold down the river, will not take much persuading that its fears are justified. It will not help if, or when, meetings are shunted to online-only coverage \u2013 or \u201cshoved down some internet pipe\u201d as Michael O\u2019Leary, Ireland\u2019s leading owner, recently put it. The British courses, on the other hand, and the smaller ones in particular, will kick up a stink if they feel they are being edged out to accommodate the Irish coverage, and as shareholders they will expect to be heard.\nSky has also flexed its financial muscle by persuading two of RTV\u2019s most prestigious tracks, Ascot and Chester, to jump ship from early next year. RTV always likes to claim that it has the very best of British racing \u2013 in the past, some of its people were known to sneeringly refer to ATR as \u201cAll The Rubbish\u201d \u2013 but without Ascot, it is like a football team claiming to have all the best players, except Messi.\nAll this means that when it comes to the front line of its major commercial battle, Sky Sports Racing will feel that it starts the year more than holding its own. That should, in turn, free up some resources to engage in manoeuvres on another front: a potential bid to secure the sport\u2019s \u201cterrestrial\u201d rights, held on a four\u2011year monopoly by ITV, when the contract comes up for renewal at the end of 2020.\nIf Sky is seriously considering a move for the mainstream rights to Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and York among others, it will need to start putting its bid together within the next few months. That could put several pundits who are due to be working for both ITV Racing and Sky Sports Racing in 2019 in a difficult, if not untenable, position. How can either side hope to keep commercially sensitive information in-house when some of the staff are on both payrolls?\nIt promises to be an intriguing subplot for those of us watching from ringside as the new era in racing broadcasting develops over the months to come. If Sky Sports Racing\u2019s coverage is judged a success \u2013 and given the amount of money, effort, talent and tech involved, it should be \u2013 then tracks such as Cheltenham, Ascot and Goodwood will be keen to hear what their biggest meetings could look like if Sky gets the terrestrial rights, and how much it will offer.\nThis time last year, Sky was something of a sleeping partner in At The Races. This time next year, it could be on the verge of becoming the dominant player in televised racing, and the action in front of the cameras will be scarcely the half of it.", "label": 0}, "text-72": {"text": "Leeds\u2019 Stevie Ward keeps mental health in mind despite setbacks\nPhilanthropist, mental health ambassador and rugby league player. Stevie Ward is not your average 25\u2011year-old, but then again, very little about his life as a professional sportsman could be considered ordinary. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t think this would have been the path I\u2019d have taken when I was teenager, but life works in mysterious ways,\u201d the Leeds Rhinos second-rower says.\nWhile most players prepared for the remaining rounds of Super League\u2019s regular season in the traditional manner of rest, recovery and training, Ward was combining mental health seminars with his work to recover from a six\u2011month knee problem. The injury is the latest setback to halt the career of a player many believe to be one of the most talented English forwards in recent years. But Ward remains pragmatic.\n\u201cThe tough times you deal with hold you in good stead for what\u2019s to come across the rest of your career,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to get involved with all sorts of different stuff like workshops with businesses and the NHS. There are lessons you can learn, for sure.\u201d\nWard\u2019s outlook is refreshingly positive, especially considering the lows he has experienced. He has spoken candidly about suffering with depression in his early 20s following injury problems. That prompted him to establish the online magazine and podcast Mantality, aimed at encouraging more men to be open about their mental health problems. But having since experienced two further long-term layoffs in the past couple of years, even the toughest of individuals would have been tested by what Ward has had to endure.\n\u201cMentally, it\u2019s unbelievably challenging,\u201d he says. \u201cPhysically you probably get better at dealing with it, but you do have to keep asking yourself why you\u2019re doing this. Viewers of the game probably don\u2019t grasp how serious a question that can be until you find yourself in that position, with the amount of work you have to put yourself through, especially mentally.\u201d\nWard returned from his latest injury, a knee problem that required two different operations, in the loss on Friday against Salford. With Leeds safe from relegation with two games of the season remaining, Ward insists there was little pressure from the Rhinos to return this season. Having been out since February, he has his own motivation to get back playing.\nThis week, Leeds-born Ward was included in the Great Britain squad for the upcoming tour of the southern hemisphere. It is a show of faith from the Lions coaching staff in a player who has been absent for so long and a sign that his season, however frustrating it has been, may not be over just yet. \u201cI could have left it until next season but I\u2019m ready,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to show people I can be out there again.

It\u2019s been a tough year for the club, battling relegation, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve been able to help off the field in other ways.\u201d\nEven though his playing career is back on track again, Ward will not relent in his mission to spread the message of how it is OK to talk. \u201cThis year has been another reminder that we can only respond to what\u2019s thrown our way in tough times,\u201d he says. \u201cBut rugby league is the best vehicle for me to live to my values and though there\u2019s been challenges I get better from each one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message I want to keep reminding people about, that you can draw from your tough times.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-73": {"text": "TV tonight: David Schwimmer's comedy sleuth\nNick Mohammed pens and stars in this new comedy set within the secretive confines of the GCHQ cybersecurity team \u2013 a close-knit group of misfits whose subdued, biscuit-eating existence is disrupted by the arrival of American NSA agent Jerry (David Schwimmer).

A counter-claim is that current major fissures, raised passions and felt disparities serve only to signify our governing system\u2019s ongoing inability to solve a complex muddle of societal, economic and regional policy problems.\nAlas, conventional political parties care more about gaining power to deliver their policies than they do about devising the nation\u2019s best possible governing system and constitution.

Actual anarchist communities were never half as messy as this.\nThose hoping to explain our national fiasco have resorted to warnings of Russian interference, fake news and troll armies, or at best made a show of listening to \u201cvery real concerns\u201d courtesy of hasty vox pops brought to us from down-at-heel Leave-voting towns.\nFor Jack Shenker, understanding the Brexit vote and the transformation of party politics means looking for answers where others have failed to tread. As a former Guardian Egypt correspondent (Shenker is the author of the acclaimed Egyptians), he reported from the convulsions of Tahrir Square and occupied factories of Damietta. His contention is that Britain\u2019s political ruptures require equal rigour and investigation.\nShenker\u2019s sympathies with those fighting back from the left are made clear from the outset\nAnd so he roams, across our nation of chain coffee outlets, bedsits, luxury flats and ghost retail parks. He meets far-right web activists in Newcastle and asylum seekers in Glasgow; in visits to the likes of Tilbury and Oldham he seeks out the victims of austerity, benefit sanctions and \u201chostile environment\u201d policy, of long-term post-industrial decline, atomised communities, poverty wages and the crisis in affordable housing.\nShenker dismisses as fantasists those \u201cwho believe the pre-2008 world can somehow be resurrected\u201d, and says that a surge in a disorderly grassroots politics is filling the gaps left by Britain\u2019s political elites.\nWhile his chapters have seemingly vague titles such as Community, Work, Homes, Borders and Youth, these broad overlapping themes emerge in Shenker\u2019s detailed and passionate reporting. Debi, a campaigner working with homeless young people in Manchester, tells him that there has been a \u201ctearing of the social fabric\u201d that has \u201cleft many of these kids with a kind of PTSD\u201d.He talks to Fatima, 54, who lives out of two suitcases in Stratford, east London, having migrated from her native Guinea-Bissau to Portugal, then to the UK; she works two minimum-wage cleaning jobs, from 6.30am till 9pm, before returning to the grim, precarious bedsit she shares with nine strangers.\nFatima\u2019s miserable situation introduces the book\u2019s most intriguing chapter, which details the agile new micro-unions such as United Voices of the World (UVW), which have sprung up in the age of the gig economy (a story told in Callum Cant\u2019s new Riding for Deliveroo). We are reminded that 7 million Britons living below the poverty line are from working families. Now We Have Your Attention argues that the militant, DIY trade union action emerging among Deliveroo and Uber drivers, outsourced cleaners and Wetherspoon workers reflects the politics of our age just as surely as the ancient rules on prorogation, or machinations of the ERG \u2013 and that the Amazon \u201cfulfilment centre\u201d in Tilbury is as important a site for understanding the future of politics as the Palace of Westminster.\nUVW was founded in 2014 and, we are told, spent \u00a33,358 on communications in its last accounts, which may be why you are unlikely to have heard of it (Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, by contrast, spent just under \u00a33.5m). Populated by workers such as Fatima and a skeleton staff, the union has won several pay rises for its impoverished workers. Such successes are inspiring, but the difficult truth for those looking to restore their faith in democracy is that most of the forces Shenker documents remain small and marginal.\nYet we are left hopeful. The author\u2019s passion \u2013 and the defiance of his subjects \u2013 is infectious. And you have to applaud him for finding the untold stories behind the rolling omnishambles that is British politics in 2019.\n\u2022 Now We Have Your Attention: The New Politics of the People by Jack Shenker is published by Bodley Head (\u00a316.99).

First throwing open the door to a previously unthinkable possibility \u2013 immediate, concrete plans to fight the crisis, far beyond anything proposed by the inadequate Paris Agreement \u2013 and then, just as quickly, slamming that door shut. Perhaps even more tightly than before, given Johnson\u2019s disinterest in all things climate-related. And because now the party without an apparent serious climate plan is in charge of taking the critical first steps towards Theresa May\u2019s government\u2019s goal of hitting net-zero by 2050, while the parties willing to commit to action are shut out of power by the enormous Tory majority.\nThe climate assembly \u2013 which met for the second time in Birmingham last weekend \u2013 was created to act as a kind of workaround for traditional partisan deadlock, and to chart a safe route forward for governments to act on the climate crisis. Its conceit is that it offers direct access to the real will of the people: 110 citizens \u2013 chosen to be representative of the British population \u2013 attend sessions where they are briefed by experts on the issue; they then come up with a set of policies to solve it. A citizens\u2019 assembly in Ireland helped the government to put forward the referendum that ended that country\u2019s abortion ban last year.\nThe best chance for tackling the climate crisis comes from politicians and parties who don\u2019t wait for incremental solutions\nThe mood at the assembly so far has been hopeful. The setup assumes that our political leaders have the best intentions, but are paralysed by indecision, both because of the unfathomable number of options and the fear that the public will punish them for the wrong choice. The whole function of politics here is outsourced to the public: they\u2019re asked to make their own tough decisions. And so they have sat attentively listening to presentations on the greatest hits of never-tried climate policy, and have been asked to weigh them up. There was mention of personal carbon allowances (be your own carbon market), a very popular idea in 2008, and more recent schemes such as creating nationwide repair networks, and forcing manufacturers to build goods to last.\nAll the solutions presented reflect the mainstream of British climate policy over the past two decades. The experts put forward a fairly cautious mix of technocratic market incentives and regulation, with large spending programmes reserved for infrastructure projects. Still, there were signs that the assembly might take some bold decisions. The experts barely mentioned free public transport, yet were quizzed on it incessantly. And the members wanted to know who was most responsible for emissions, and how they could be made to pay. The polls suggest that public opinion has leapt ahead of the government\u2019s climate ambition over the past year, and it\u2019s possible that the assembly recommendations will confirm that.\nBut even if the assembly puts the most progressive options in front of the government, there\u2019s still the sticky question of implementation. \u201cHow can we be sure the government will follow on our recommendations,\u201d an assembly member asked Labour MP Rachel Reeves, one of only three elected officials in attendance. She didn\u2019t have a good answer, but she could easily have told them it\u2019s not on her \u2013 she\u2019s only ever been in opposition during her 10-year tenure in parliament. The assembly\u2019s most valuable contribution may be breaking the deadlock between equally effective but controversial policies \u2013 a land-use carbon tax or a consumption tax, for example \u2013 although the Tories may well choose neither. The problem with how to tackle the climate crisis in the UK is not partisan deadlock, but lack of government interest.\nA citizens\u2019 assembly can\u2019t change that. Its decisions aren\u2019t guaranteed to sway the government from its prearranged course. The Irish assembly is held up as a model for its recommendations on the abortion referendum. However, it also submitted proposals on the climate crisis, from huge investments in peat restoration and public transport to a tax on agriculture emissions. The Irish government ignored all of these, in favour of what the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called \u201cambitious but realistic\u201d policies to \u201cnudge people to change behaviour\u201d. Nudging people towards radical change is a depressing continuation of the managerial away-day optimism that has dominated thinking on the climate crisis over the past 20 years. One would have better luck trying to nudge a stream back up a mountain.\nInstead, the best chance for tackling the crisis comes from politicians and parties who don\u2019t wait for incremental solutions. Party politics has become an unexpected laboratory for fusing climate policies to big, popular, social spending programmes \u2013 based on the model of a green new deal, which was first put forward by experts in 2008. Unlike a sitting government, opposition policy shops are a frictionless environment: ambition can be doubled and redoubled without pushback.\nAnd if the programmes capture the public attention, they are quickly copied by other parties. Labour proposed a green industrial revolution based on using the resources of the state to foster green industries, creating jobs and increasing living standards. This in turn pushed the Liberal Democrats to try to match the offer \u2013 remarkable for a party committed to the decentralisation of state power. In the US, the Bernie Sanders campaign is not only currently leading the polls to win the Democratic nomination with the Green New Deal as a top-line policy, it has also pushed every other candidate towards embracing the idea \u2013 something that would have seemed impossible just four years ago. \nFor a long time it has been assumed that public opinion is a barrier to climate action. But the climate assembly will likely confirm what the polls have been indicating for the past year: that people are now ready to move further and faster on climate action than the minimal effort shown by the government. If their advice is ignored or diluted beyond recognition, then maybe citizens\u2019 assemblies are an imperfect mechanism for the scale of change needed to tackle the climate crisis. Only a green new deal for the UK will do.\n\u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment", "label": 0}, "text-83": {"text": "The 'Zoom parliament' could inspire a more democratic Commons\n\u00c9mile Durkheim argued that traditions, along with other social institutions, exist because they do some kind of job for society as a whole. Accordingly, in parliament, the dress codes for MPs, the ermine, the gilded this and that, the bobbing and the bowing, are all said to encourage both lawmakers and citizens to take what happens in Westminster seriously.\nIf you watch a standard prime minister\u2019s questions, which for centuries has been dominated by a baying mob of former public school boys, you might get the feeling that traditions aren\u2019t always collectively beneficial. But our new and decidedly untraditional \u201cZoom parliament\u201d has transformed the Commons. While MPs are still required to wear appropriate clothing and some politicians have decorated their webcam backdrops with their own fancy accessories, remote working has largely stripped parliament of its customs and costumes. We have been confronted with the bare bones of our representative system, and the result has been overwhelmingly positive.\nIf this is not to be swept away, modernising MPs and the Speaker must make aspects of the 'Zoom parliament' permanent\nWednesday\u2019s PMQs was like never before. No facile insults were screamed. There was no sonic wall of jeering. There were only a handful of MPs in the chamber, and those joining online were muted by the clerks until it was their turn to ask a question. Consequently, with the exception of some quiet \u201cHear hears\u201d, almost no one spoke until they were invited to by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. This week our semi-digital Commons looked, for the first time in a long while, like the epicentre of a grownup democracy, sensible and pleasingly boring.\nAs for the rest of parliamentary business: select committees, ministerial statements, debates and questions from MPs are now all taking place online. Votes have been postponed for the moment, and plans for a digital system are being developed, so that the whips won\u2019t have to force hundreds of MPs and peers, some of them potentially infectious with Covid-19, into the lobbies.\nParliament\u2019s old guard aren\u2019t wrong to worry that a working-from-home parliament will lack some creative spontaneity as MPs are unable to take ministers to task with off-the-cuff questions. But look at these reforms from the perspective of people for whom evenings and days spent away from home are unrealistic. The ability to work remotely may open up a career in politics to a more diverse cohort of MPs. We\u2019ll need more reform than this \u2013 allowing MPs to take parental leave is particularly key \u2013 but more remote working is a start.\nWe want MPs to be able to see their families, sending a signal that a better work/life balance is key to a happier society. And we want MPs to spend time in their communities, because we need them to represent the interests of people who have too often been ignored by politics. In that case, the benefits of making parliament accessible surely outweigh the costs.\nThese changes have civilised the Commons and have the potential to make British politics more democratic and representative. But if all this is not to be swept away when lockdown eventually ends, then modernising MPs and Hoyle must make many aspects of the \u201cZoom parliament\u201d permanent. We\u2019ll be waiting a long time for some reforms, like an elected second chamber and a more egalitarian party system that suppresses Westminster\u2019s bullying culture. But there\u2019s plenty to do in the meantime.\nDurkheim was wrong. Traditions exist not because they benefit society, but because they benefit those who hold power.

A seven-year old boy named Lachino Mcintosh drowned as his family attempted to find safer ground than their home on the Abaco islands. Dorian is reportedly the strongest hurricane to have ever hit the Bahamas and the second most powerful Atlantic storm on record. Five deaths have been reported so far, and more are likely. The Bahamian MP and minister of foreign affairs, the Honorable Darren Henfield, offered a bleak update form the area he represents to reporters: \u201cWe have reports of casualties, we have reports of bodies being seen.\u201d\nRising temperatures don\u2019t make hurricanes more frequent, but they do help make them more devastating. Each of the last five years have seen Category 5 storms pass through the Atlantic, brewed over hotter than usual waters. How many more people have to die before political leaders treat climate change like the global catastrophe it is?\nDonald Trump has been rightly criticized for golfing as Dorian devastated the Bahamas and drifted toward the US. But it\u2019s as good a metaphor as any for the way elites across political lines have approached the crisis they have helped create and continue to fuel. One of the cruelest realities of global warming is that the people whohave done the least to contribute to it tend to be among the first and worst hit. Nations like the United States have amassed tremendous wealth both by burning fossil fuels and exploiting land and labor from the places most threatened by rising temperatures through slavery, colonialism and their living legacies. Similar inequalities play out within nations, including in the US, where most people\u2019s own carbon footprints are dwarfed by those of the billionaires and fossil fuel executives best equipped to insulate themselves from heavy weather.\nInternationally, climate-vulnerable countries have for decades made the case that more ambition is needed, focusing policymakers\u2019 concerns on to issues of equity.

In its special report released last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013 a level already dangerous for low-lying states \u2013 would require an annual investment in decarbonization of $3tn through 2050. And that\u2019s just to mitigate warming. Trillions more will be required to adapt to the climate impacts already locked in, ensuring that when hurricanes like Dorian do hit they do less damage. Repairing the loss and damage of storms and other disasters is expected to cost $300bn a year by 2030, jumping to $1.2tn a year by 2060. As the world\u2019s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and its biggest economy, the United States has both the ability and an outsized responsibility to decarbonize rapidly and make it possible for countries do the same \u2013 a climate debt.\nBack in 2009, industrialized nations pledged to mobilize $100bn toward mitigation and adaptation efforts by 2020, a response to persistent demands from climate justice organizers. As of last September, only $3.5bn had actually been allocated to the fund and just $10.3bn pledged to the multilateral body that\u2019s supposed to be the main vehicle for dispersing that money, the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Before he left office, Obama promised $3bn toward the GCF. Just $1bn of that ever materialized before Trump withdrew that vow. That\u2019s a fraction of the estimated $15bn a year the federal government spends subsidizing fossil fuel development. At the end of August, the US Import-Export Bank approved $5bn in financing for a natural gas project in Mozambique. We have more than enough money to fight the climate crisis, at home and abroad. It\u2019s just going to all the wrong places.\nGreenhouse gases don\u2019t fit neatly within borders. Efforts to curb them can\u2019t either. Like other wealthy countries, the US has a responsibility to pay its fair share for the damage it\u2019s caused to the planet \u2013 not through predatory loans or disastrously managed charity but through solidarity. Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan for a Green New Deal pledges $200bn to the GCF, makes climate a centerpiece of American trade and foreign policy and ends fossil fuel financing through institutions like the Import-Export Bank. An extensive, recently released blueprint of a Green New Deal for Europe lays out a rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels, accounting for the emissions rich countries export abroad through trade and the need for a thoroughly democratic response to the climate crisis that doesn\u2019t let the governments who have engineered this crisis call all the shots on how the world handles it.\nIt\u2019ll be tempting, as Dorian drifts toward Florida, for observers in the US to forget the death and destruction it has left behind elsewhere. That would be a mistake. Jeff Bezos\u2019s escape plans notwithstanding, we\u2019re all stuck on this warming planet together. Whether human civilization stays intact amid all this worsening weather depends on recognizing our shared humanity \u2013 and designing policy accordingly. Platitudes for the planet won\u2019t cut it.\nKate Aronoff is a freelance journalist covering climate change and US politics", "label": 0}, "text-86": {"text": "The Greta Thunberg effect: are climate crisis documentaries feeling it?\nThe eco documentary 2040 is a gentle antidote to environmental anxiety. Directed by Damon Gameau, it imagines a world 20 years from now, free from the climate crisis that\u2019s gobbling up our globe. Committed to changing the nihilistic narrative surrounding climate change, Gameau takes his audience on a search for solutions and offers up a message of hope.\nAs 2040 is released, however, the doom and gloom of the climate crisis Gameau\u2019s documentary takes pains to avoid is inescapable. Australia is ablaze. New South Wales, where he lives with his wife and two children, is experiencing the worst bushfires the country has ever seen. His daughter, to whom 2040 is dedicated, is unable to attend school. For Gameau, the irony of this tragedy stings. \u201cThousand of school kids were derided for protesting against the very thing that\u2019s now forcing them to miss school,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are so frustrated. They\u2019re overwhelmed. They\u2019re angry. Our government is still denying that the fires are climate related. The cognitive dissonance is remarkable.\u201d\nGameau\u2019s frustration at his government\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the climate crisis is noticeably absent from this film. Shifting the focus away from horrific stories of floods and fires, of political ignorance and denial, 2040 is instead a blueprint for the way out of the mess. \u201cThere\u2019s been a failure of imagination,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of constantly beating people over the head with how bad things are, we need to inspire them.\u201d\nIn 2040, Gameau interviews a host of environmental experts, showing us networks of solar panels, seaweed platforms, the electrification of transport and decentralised energy grids: all solutions to the climate crisis and all of which exist today. Quirky editing has experts perching on toasters, tin roofs and wind turbines as they explain the intricacies of each. It\u2019s unusual and engaging. The message: we must put these ideas into practice if we\u2019re to make any difference.\nGameau says he made 2040 for his daughter\u2019s generation. The film returns repeatedly to warm interviews with children, gently reminding us whose future is at stake. Asked to imagine themselves as adults, kids giggle at the thought of chocolate rain and rocket boots. Climate change is their biggest concern. Unprompted, they speak of hopes of an end to deforestation and dream of \u201cmeat grown from a seed\u201d. One imagines an \u201cintergalactic rubbish dimension\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s their future,\u201d Gameau says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to show them there are people who care about that.\u201d\nWith the success of the school strikes, which has seen more than a million children take to the streets to demand government action on the climate crisis, I ask Gameau if it\u2019s not the kids who need convincing, but the adults. \u201cKids voices are working,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are waking up.\u201d He is determined to use 2040 as a tool for change. It has been projected on to the walls of the UN. A copy of the DVD will be sent to every Australian MP. A screening in the UK parliament is planned for the New Year.\nIn an effort to reach as many young people as possible, 2040 has been screened free for children in Australia and the Into film festival has rolled out free screenings for schools in England. Delegates to the Youth Climate summit attended a screening in New York. Even singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding has had a private screening.\nCould 2040 mark the beginning of the \u201cGreta effect\u201d in documentaries? Gameau thinks so. \u2018\u201cGovernments, Hollywood, the fossil fuel industry \u2013 they\u2019ve always known that film is incredibly powerful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be clever and start using the medium for our own benefit.\u201d\nWith Extinction Rebellion keen to encourage film-makers to focus on the climate crisis, I asked Will Skeaping, co-editor of This Is Not a Drill: An Extinction Rebellion Handbook, how useful he thinks film can be to the cause. \u201cFilm-making is vital,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to bring this crisis into all forms of conversation. Film, as the most accessible medium, is one of the best ways to do that.\u201d\nGameau\u2019s documentary shows us there is a way out of the climate crisis. It listens to children, then amplifies their voices. Though the film focuses on the personal changes we can make, Gameau has harnessed the medium to target the political, too. Afterwards, it\u2019s over to us. As Skeaping says: \u201cIt\u2019s about getting people out of the cinema and on to the streets.\u201d\n\u2022 2040 out now in the UK.

He emphasised that the move was no reflection on China, adding that the country\u2019s response had saved the world from many more cases and deaths.\nOf the 9,320 confirmed cases so far, only 98 have been outside China, he said.\n\u201cSo far we have not seen any deaths outside China, for which we must be grateful,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cAlthough these numbers are relatively small compared to the number of cases in China, we must act together now to limit further spread.\u201d\n\u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill prepared to deal with it,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cThe decision is not a vote of no confidence in China.\u201d\nThe emergencies committee, which advises the director-general, made a series of recommendations. Tedros said the first of these was that \u201cthere is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.\u201d It also said that it was important to combat the rumours and misinformation circulating about the outbreak.\n\u201cIn the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cChina is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak despite the severe social and economic impact that is is having on China.\u201d\nIn the UK, the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responded by increasing their risk assessment from low to moderate. \u201cThis does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\u201cAs we have previously said, it is likely there will be individual cases and we are confident in the ability of the NHS and HSC in Northern Ireland to manage these in a way that protects the public and provides high-quality care.\u201d\nDr Jeremy Farrar, the director of health foundation Wellcome, said the WHO had made the right call. \u201cCountries, public health teams and researchers worldwide have been acting on this with the very highest level of concern for the last few weeks. But this virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed, with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDeclaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen governments\u2019 focus on protecting citizens. But we must also step up as an international community to make sure no one is left behind \u2013 with all interventions, including public health measures, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines available to everyone. This will challenge the best-resourced countries but will have disproportionate impact on fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries.\u201d\nMost people who have fallen sick in other countries have travelled from China\u2019s Hubei province. So far there has been only a very small number of cases in these countries of transmission from person to person \u2013 the development that health experts most fear.\nThe United States reported human-to-human transmission on Thursday. The man who became unwell in the US is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who became sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan. There has also been human-to-human transmission in Vietnam, Japan and Germany.\nIn China, the health chief of Huanggang city, which has reported 500 cases \u2013 second only to Wuhan \u2013 was sacked by the Chinese government following public anger over her inability to answer questions about the outbreak on state television.\nTang Zhihong floundered when questioned by a central government inspection team and a reporter. Asked how many sick people there were in one of the hospitals, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m unclear. I only know how many beds there are. Don\u2019t ask me how many people are being treated.\u201d\nHer TV appearance generated more than half-a-million comments on the Weibo account of state television\u2019s news channel, most of them angry. A few hours after the programme aired, the city\u2019s health department said in a terse and brief statement that Tang had been removed. It gave no other details.\nThe US and Japan have started evacuating citizens, while other countries are poised to send chartered flights to Wuhan city \u2013 the centre of the outbreak in Hubei \u2013 amid reports that some evacuations had been held up by delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese authorities.\nThe first British flight to evacuate citizens will carry about 150 British nationals and 50 other people, mainly from the EU. The flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan at 5am local time on Friday for RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. It is understood that the British passengers will be taken to a former NHS facility in the Wirral and quarantined for 14 days.\nAustralia is yet to receive permission from the Chinese government to evacuate hundreds of its citizens, and New Zealand has launched a separate rescue mission, though a timeline remains unclear.\nFrance, South Korea and other countries are also removing their citizens or making plans to do so. About 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans are scheduled to be flown out of Wuhan on two French planes this week.\nIn Italy, a cruise ship\u2019s 6,000 passengers were kept onboard while tests were conducted on two Chinese travellers.\nIn Moscow, the Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin issued a decree ordering the temporary closure of the country\u2019s border with China, which extends for 2,600 miles (4,200km). The border had been de facto closed because of the lunar new-year holiday, but authorities said the closure would be extended until 1 March.

Except this is not all there is and it\u2019s in no way a fair play. Because the current round of parlour games is dominating our parliament at a time when Australia faces a series of existential challenges \u2013 environmental, economic and moral \u2013 that go to the core of our national interest.\nAfter more than a decade of inaction, Australia is lagging in reaching its global commitments to reduce carbon emissions, looking to amp up rather than reduce both coal exports and local consumption of fossil fuels.\nAs our regions bear the brunt of climate change, the minister responsible for natural disasters has spent a week struggling to answer the most basic of questions on whether climate change is scientific fact or a socialist chimera.\nWhile the United Nations works with world leaders to raise ambitions on Paris, Scott Morrison will not to be attending the conference even though he will be in the US at the time. The implication is clear: on the world stage our PM has nothing to offer.\nDevoid of national leadership, the majority of Australians who have consistently recognised the threat appear to be switching off. If the figures in this weeks\u2019 Essential Report are anything to go by, the entreaties of our children to act are likely to fall on deaf ears too.\nIt\u2019s a similar playbook as the global trade showdown between America and China gathers momentum, dragging Australia inevitably into geopolitical choices with profound long-term consequences. But for our government, the decision matrix is all politics.\nDonald Trump is treated less as a menace and more as an inspiration. While revelations of Chinese influence inside the Morrison government are disingenuously batted away, the imperative to clean up foreign political donations as a condition for asserting national sovereignty is subservient to the imperative of not losing an early scalp.\nThe PM will feign outrage at ALP fundraising, but push back on any proposition that the challenge is more systemic than specific.\nAnd all the while we turn a blind eye to the moral implications of our border policies as the souls languishing on Manus and Nauru sink further into the abyss. The majority support this wilful cruelty, either anaesthetised to the concept of indefinite detention or convinced the measures are required to save them from the scourge of people-smugglers (curiously the only time they\u2019re seen as something approaching human).\nWith this ballast, the government will continue to prosecute its border security agenda, attempting to wind back the medevac procedures that purport to assert that even this cruelty should have limits.\nAnd every step of the game is another \u201ctest for Labor\u201d, another chance to score a point, while the job of governing for the long term is wilfully ignored.\nMy favourite piece of media analysis was written 35 years go by the late, great Douglas Adams, in one of the many sequels to his Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy masterpiece. Having failed to warn humanity that Earth was about to be destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass, the world\u2019s dolphin population has packed up and headed off to another dimension with the simple farewell message \u201cso long, and thanks for all the fish\u201d.\nThe story dominates global headlines for weeks, as the world\u2019s leaders come to terms with the metaphysical implications of the amphibious diaspora. But over time, interest wanes until one day it drops off the news pages altogether. As the Times editor muses: what are we supposed to write \u2013 \u201cdolphins still missing\u201d?\nAdams\u2019 genius was to critique the decline of consequence before it was hyper-charged by clicks and shares. But in so many ways our politics reflects his post-dolphin world where we lack the curiosity and staying power to make sense of the big questions: \u201cEarth Still Warming\u201d, \u201cShowdown Still Coming\u201d, \u201cHumans Still Rotting\u201d.\nWhen our politics can\u2019t find a way of addressing the big issues is it really surprising that people lose faith in the system? And while there may be surface diversion in scandals and sideshows, the deep engagement between citizen and nation can only erode over time.\nAs Labor attempts to work its way back into the narrative, surely this must be the entry point: not just jumping to avoid the wedge but taking the hits as it works to build something bigger.\n\u2022 Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential.

I felt we were up against it and it was becoming real. Seeing British lawns the colour of dry hay for weeks, getting a heatstroke when vising Kew Gardens, and lastly the extent and ferocity of the wildfires in California truly scared me. I\u2019ve joined Greenpeace. Catherine Laz, 56, London\nThe moment that did it for me was reading the IPCC report that said we have 12 years to reduce carbon emissions to keep global warming to a limit of 1.5 degrees, and that 2 degrees is the tipping point. Knowing that we are warming at an average of 0.2 degrees per decade is scary, and the projections of reaching 4 degrees by 2050 if business as usual is continued shocked me. I\u2019ve been reading more about climate change and the hot summer of 2018 has definitely been an eye opener in demonstrating its huge impact. We have been fed the lies by governments and businesses that we can significantly reduce climate change by taking personal responsibility \u2013 such as recycling more and turning off lights \u2013 when really we need to be demanding government to tax carbon, divest from fossil fuel and invest in renewables. Amina Jahan Ali, 26, London\nI\u2019ve always thought I was reasonably aware of climate change so this summer I had a fairly uneasy feeling about the heatwave we were experiencing. In August I read the hot house earth article in the Guardian and had what can only be described as a mental breakdown. I had a week where I barely ate, drank or slept. It was like I was suddenly thrust into a different world. The thought of having brought children into a dying world was hugely distressing. I hid from the news for a week or two but then decided that this was making things worse so plunged into articles on the true state of the planet, and am doing what I can including going vegan and becoming a member of the Extinction Rebellion. Jennie Gibson, 34, Manchester\nWhat really made me take notice was the UN report this year and an article in the New York magazine, which said we basically now have the permission to freak out. I don\u2019t think people realize how climate change is going to affect us \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it in 2018 with extreme heatwaves in countries such as India. It makes me so mad to know that the really rich people in the world will probably escape death from this and the ordinary people are the ones who will suffer. It\u2019s very frightening and unjust. I heard children in Australia were striking in schools for more action to be taken and hope this tactic is adopted by more people to demand appropriate action if it\u2019s not being done. Margaret Lynch, 31, Ireland\nClimate change has made me fearful before, but in 2018 I am thinking about it every day, and I am terrified that the lives my children might be living in a few years will be ones of desolation and suffering.\nIt was really brought home by the launch of Extinction Rebellion, which I discovered via George Monbiot. I still feel unsure about what I can actually do, beyond the micro-scale \u2013 avoiding plastic, driving and flying as little as possible, etc. In this country I\u2019m not prepared to get myself arrested \u2013 but what, other than civil disobedience, will change the minds of the policymakers? Shari Daya, 40, Cape Town\nFires in Northern California, where I live, were one of the main factors for me. Two years in a row, in addition to many lives lost and homes destroyed, we have had several days of choking, toxic smoke affecting millions and millions of people, including me and my loved ones. Last year the smoke lasted about 5 days; this year it was 12. Next year, will the smoke last for 20 days? A month? How much clean air will we have in Northern CA as the years go on? When my daughter becomes an adult, will she say \u201cwell, in my day at least we still did outside sports.\u201d\nOf course I had heard about climate change before, but I think I really thought it was mostly about sea-level rise, and I thought, \u201cwell, as long as I live more than a few feet above sea level, I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d But in this piece, a professor says \u201cthe odds of human civilization reaching the 22nd century are often estimated at no better than 50/50.\u201d This statistic walloped me, shocked me, and in fact frightened me beyond belief. Among other things I have joined 350.org and attended the Climate March in San Francisco in 2018. Isobel White, 50, San Francisco Bay\nHaving endured ex Hurricane Ophelia last year and the Beast from the East this year, the message did become more relevant than ever. My concern is that some remedies put forward raise legitimate concerns too. For example, the French riots show us that there is little democratic appetite in developed countries to implement the IPCC\u2019s solution, which is to rapidly decarbonise our economies using carbon taxes as tools to ration fossil fuel consumption, while the coverage of the activities of Extinction Rebellion in the UK towards the end of the year shows that extreme measures are currently only being undertaken by relatively few. David, 50, Ireland\nI think I\u2019d recognised it before and seen the effects, but this year it really seemed to hit home in the developed countries. People, the media and politics are starting to take notice \u2013 now we need to act. Aid agencies have been complicit in past downplaying of the threat \u2013 choosing not to emphasise climate as a clear diver and direct cause of emergencies for fear of alienating donors and supporters. This must change: we have to galvanise all elements of society and international politics and ensure we act. Much of the work I do as an aid worker is in response to climate change or the effects of climate change on politics and people \u2013 this isn\u2019t just serious, it\u2019s an existential threat that drives crises across the globe. People in the worst affected regions won\u2019t stay where they are and we are woefully underprepared to deal with the consequences. David Wightwick\nI have been concerned about climate change for some time, but was prompted to be more actively involved this year due to the changing political landscape. No longer can we count on our governments alone to address the threat in a meaningful and comprehensive way. Democracy and societal good needs loud citizen voices now. Aside from supporting political parties that have policies to address climate change I have joined a local group working for a more locally sustainable society.

Their 13 industry groups declared spending a further \u20ac128m in the same period.\nIn total, between 2010 and 2018 the companies and their lobbying industry bodies have spent at least \u20ac251.3m on lobbying activities within EU institutions, according to the report by Corporate Europe Observatory, Food & Water Europe, Friends of the Earth Europe and Greenpeace.\nThe researchers say the figure represents the tip of the iceberg, as in some years companies made no declarations of spending in the voluntary register. The report also does not examine lobbying spending by each company relating to national parliaments and institutions.\nAnalysis of the European commission\u2019s public record of meetings shows the oil firms and their industry groups employ 200 lobbyists in Brussels, who have held 327 meetings with top EC officials since 2014, when Jean-Claude Juncker took office \u2013 the equivalent of more than one meeting per week.\nAt the same time, the profits of the big five have continued to rise to more than $82bn (\u00a362bn) in 2018.\nPascoe Sabido, researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, said: \u201cBig polluters like Shell, BP and their lobby groups have delayed, weakened and sabotaged EU action on the climate emergency thanks to their hefty lobby spending. A cool quarter of a billion over the last decade buys a lot of access and influence in Brussels.\u201d\nThe report comes after the Guardian\u2019s Polluters series, which revealed that 20 oil and gas companies \u2013 including BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total \u2013 can be directly linked to a third of greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. The companies \u2013 which include multinationals and state-owned firms \u2013 are continuing to expand their operations and driving the climate emergency, despite having been aware for decades of their industry\u2019s devastating impact on the planet.\nThe report says the lobbying has succeeded in watering down EU climate legislation. Lobbying, it says, peaks at times when legislation is being drawn up. The oil and gas companies, and their industry groups had high spending in 2014 during the discussions over the EU\u2019s 2030 climate targets, when they spent \u20ac34.3m on lobbying the EU institutions.\nThe report says the climate targets were weakened as a result; they included no binding energy savings target and included a \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d renewable energy target.\nThe Guardian recently revealed how the car industry and big oil companies are the most negative influencers on climate policy of all the top 250 biggest investor-owned industry and their trading associations.\nThe NGOs behind the report are demanding that politics be freed from fossil fuel influence. In a call, supported by 200 civil society organisations, they said they wanted to see an end to the fossil fuel industry accessing decision making. They are calling for:\nan end to lobbying meetings with fossil fuel and their representatives\nno revolving door between public office and the oil and gas industry\nthe end of fossil fuel subsidies\nno sponsorships or partnerships with industry representatives\nThe call to set up a firewall between the fossil fuel industry and democratic politics comes as pressure is growing on the oil and gas industry.

One of the latest alarmist reports of this nature, Confronting Climate Change in the Great Lakes Region, published by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and the Ecological Society of America, and bearing the imprint of the David Suzuki Foundation, offers an example of the new local thrust in climate change activism.\n\nAmong other dire predictions, the UCS report warns the American Great Lakes states and the province of Ontario of a host of environmental threats including: declining lake levels; loss of lake ice; changes in fish distribution; invasions by non-native fish species; nutrient depletion; changes in run-off patterns; drought; river flooding; wetland shrinkage; depleted food for migrating birds; greater crop growth; more crop pests; increased ozone levels; higher shipping costs; losses of winter recreation; and more. But regional climate modeling of this sort is highly flawed. Despite the assertions of scientific certainty, the evidence supporting claims of extreme man made climate change is limited and mixed.

But difficult questions such as how to scale up existing commitments on cutting emissions, in line with stark scientific advice, and how to provide finance for poor countries to do the same, were put off for future years.\nIn the final hours, agreement was held up by a debate over the market in carbon credits, awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and for their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.\nBrazil wanted an amendment that would benefit the country for its large rainforest cover, but this was opposed by others as it could allow the double-counting of carbon credits, undermining the integrity of the system.\nThis question has now been pushed back to next year\u2019s annual conference.

Bunking off school as a young boy, he tells Laverne, allowed him to develop an interest in the arts. \u201cWhen I was meant to be doing games I would abscond the minute the games master had gone off to do other things,\u201d admits Riddell, who was children\u2019s laureate from 2015 to 2017. \u201cI\u2019d go across the river to the Tate gallery.\u201d\nRiddell, best known for his work on The Edge Chronicles and the Ottoline series, goes on to express his fear that children\u2019s early artistic inclinations are often accidentally crushed by schools. He tells Laverne: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those wonderful creative things you can do that doesn\u2019t really rely on technique.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like playing a violin. Anyone can pick up a Biro, a pencil, and they can draw. Children have an innate grasp of that, then it is educated out of them and they decide they can\u2019t draw and that is such a shame. I think part of my remit as children\u2019s laureate was to push through that.\u201d\nRiddell, 57, also believes looking at work by the young can be refreshing. \u201cIt is good, as an old cartoonist, to be refreshed by children\u2019s art,\u201d he said.\nHaving Briggs as his personal tutor between 1981 and 1984, while he was a student at Brighton Polytechnic, provided early inspiration, he recalls. An encouraging teacher, Briggs also allowed his student to glimpse his own creative processes, despite his famously private and shy nature.\n\u201cRaymond was hugely influential, and really shaped my work. Not only is he an author and illustrator, he also has a strong political sense, as you see in books such as When the Wind Blows \u2013 his extraordinary book about the aftermath of a nuclear attack.\u201d\nRiddell tells Laverne that producing satirical images for this newspaper frequently proves therapeutic: \u201cIt stops me shouting at the radio often, not because the radio coverage isn\u2019t excellent, but because drawing a political cartoon is a way of voicing my own thoughts and ideas. Sometimes it feels good to draw Donald Trump in a nappy.\u201d\nRiddell said he had the satisfying sense that he was completing a circle when he chose Ralph Vaughan Williams\u2019s Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis as one of his eight tracks for the radio show: \u201cI first heard that piece of music when I was listening to Desert Island Discs as a young man who was a little bit in love with Jenny Agutter. It was her choice on the show and I\u2019ve since listened to it many times \u2013 so it was nice to choose it myself for Lauren.\u201d\nChildren have an innate grasp of drawing, then it is educated out of them and they decide they can\u2019t draw\nThe illustrator, who also selected the folk music of the band Bird in the Belly, a Brighton-based collective, said he had found being interviewed by Laverne a pleasure. \u201cShe was so natural and relaxed. We had a lovely conversation, then I realised the show was over.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly Riddell selects a supply of sketchbooks as his one sanctioned luxury on the island, confessing to an addiction that makes it hard for him to pass a stationery shop. It was Briggs who first advised him to carry a sketchbook at all times. \u201cHe\u2019d tell me to just get on and do it \u2013 to keep filling up the sketchbook.\u201d\nAnd it was thanks to an introduction from Briggs that Riddell secured the book deal that began his publishing journey.\nRiddell\u2019s choice of book for the island is a bound copy of both Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. In June, Lewis Carroll\u2019s publisher, Macmillan, is to bring out a new edition of Alice in Wonderland accompanied by Riddell\u2019s new drawings to coincide with the new Victoria & Albert Museum exhibition dedicated to illustrations of the famous story.

Biden\u2019s energy advisor Heather Zichal said that the Reuters reports were wrong, and that instead he planned to \u201cenact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way.\u201d But the fact that it was Zichal making the statement essentially confirmed the accuracy of the original story: in the early Obama years, she\u2019d headed up an interagency working group to promote the development of domestic natural gas. \nThe working group had been formed after pressure from the American Petroleum Institute, the chief fossil-fuel lobbying group, and Zichal, in a talk to an API gathering, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how natural gas\u2014and our ability to access more of it than ever\u2014has become a game changer.\u201d Zichal left her White House job in 2013; one year later, she took a gig on the board of Cheniere Energy, a leading exporter of fracked gas, which has earned her over a million dollars.\nAnd Zichal said Biden was also turning for advice to former energy secretary Ernest Moniz, who oversaw the rise of the United States to its position as the biggest oil and gas producer on the planet and continues to recommend natural gas development, and Frank Verrastro, co-author of a report on fracking that found no \u201cunmanageable risk that would require widespread reconsideration of current recommended practices.\u201d In short, he\u2019s relying on people deeply attached to the status quo.\nThe timing of the gaffe couldn\u2019t have been more stunning\u2014it came just 72 hours after the UN released a report pointing out that climate change would help wipe out a million species in the decades ahead. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo later that day lauded the rapid melt of the Arctic, saying it would increase access to gold and diamonds, not to mention make it easier to ship junk from China. You couldn\u2019t have asked for a much better opportunity to draw a contrast, not search for a \u201cmiddle ground.\u201d\nAs recently as 2016, climate was seen as a losing issue. It was a distant problem, with unclear consequences, that would require huge sacrifices to solve. But then California caught fire, Puerto Rico got ravaged by a hurricane, and people woke up to the fact that this was clear and present danger. The IPCC report hammered home the threat. And with ideas like the Green New Deal gaining prominence, people have understood that solving the problem won\u2019t require sacrifice as much as it will create opportunity. Why would we stay in the \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d when the left lane promises solutions that will not only help the climate, but also our economy, public health, and national security?\nBut Biden\u2019s team apparently is fixated on the relatively small number of workers in the building trades unions who want to keep on constructing natural gas pipelines (and perhaps, since he hasn\u2019t signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, on big donors from the hydrocarbon sector). This is old-school thinking at its best: throw young voters, overwhelmingly fixated on climate change, under the dirty diesel bus in an effort to win a narrowing pool of union leaders, who gathered in the Oval Office with Trump to celebrate in the early days of his presidency.\nObviously Biden will be better than Trump on this (and every other) issue; obviously everyone who cares about the earth should support him if he\u2019s the nominee. (That paramount need is why I\u2019ve been running the #DemUnityTwitterProject these past weeks). And he\u2019s got time to turn his policies around\u2014I remember when he gave a wink and a nod support to those fighting the Keystone pipeline, well in advance of Obama\u2019s eventual veto of the project. His credibility with union workers is understandably high, which is why he would be the perfect person to push for large-scale retraining programs for clean energy jobs.\nBut for now Biden has done precisely the thing you\u2019d think he\u2019d be trying his hardest to avoid: showing that he\u2019s stuck in the dirty energy past. If he\u2019s going to mount a serious challenge to Trump, he\u2019s going to need the huge number of Americans for whom climate change has become the issue. On the biggest issue our civilization\u2019s ever faced, we need him thinking like it\u2019s 2030, not 2010.", "label": 0}, "text-100": {"text": "Police and health officials to get powers to detain under UK coronavirus bill\nPolice, public health and immigration officers will be able to detain people suspected of having Covid-19 and exact \u00a31,000 fines for refusing tests under emergency powers rolled out by the UK government.\nThe guidance detailed in the coronavirus bill allows public health officers to order someone believed to be infected to undergo screening and testing within 14 days.

Additional resolutions called for a quick electrification of the U.S. transportation sector and spending ever-greater sums of money at all levels of government on wind energy. The media response almost uniformly promotes the narrative the mayors are defying Trump and will meet the Paris climate goals, regardless of the federal government\u2019s position on climate change.\nThe stories are also almost uniformly light on facts and context.\nFor instance, I have been unable to find a single story reporting what the final vote was on each of the resolutions passed, nor can I find that information on the USCM website. Did an overwhelming majority favor the resolutions, or was it a close vote? \u00a0Since I suspect no true count was taken but rather it was all done through a voice vote, a vocal minority of mayors who shouted the loudest could have hijacked the proceedings aided by sympathetic chairs managing the votes, who said the \u201cayes have it,\u201d claiming the mayors are united in pushing Paris and green energy.\nSome measure of the number of mayors who are truly committed to Paris and the green agenda might be found in a poll taken before the conference. As the USCM described the survey, it \u201cfound overwhelming interest by cities to accelerate climate efforts,\u201d with:\nSounds like a significant majority of the membership of the USCM backs spending money to fight climate change and embraces renewable energy \u2026 until you learn just 66 of the 1,408 cities who are members of the USCM (that\u2019s less than 5 percent) responded to the survey. Since it\u2019s reasonable to assume mayors most active in promoting green programs would be the most likely to respond to this survey, it seems very few of the total number of USCM members wanted to stand up and have their voices counted in the climate fight.\nIn addition, just over 200 cities\u2014not 1,408\u2014have committed through various initiatives to pursue the emission reductions demanded in the Paris climate agreement and only 30, not 1,408, have joined an initiative to get 100 percent of the energy used by their communities from \u201c100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2035.\u201d\nIn short, USCM\u2019s words are not being backed up by the actions of the vast majority of its member cities. This should not be surprising, as we\u2019ve been down this road before.\nAfter then-President George W. Bush decided not to pursue the goals of the Kyoto Protocol signed by the Clinton administration, requiring the United States to cut its carbon dioxide emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012, more than 1,000 mayors signed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement saying they would meet Kyoto\u2019s targets regardless of the federal government\u2019s cooperation. As detailed by Todd Myers in National Review, despite media hype touting their environmental virtue when they announced they were bucking Bush on Kyoto, almost none of these cities met the Kyoto targets. Most of them missed their targets badly.\nSeattle, where the movement started, managed to reduce its emissions by only 1 percent from 1990 to 2012, and that reduction was almost entirely due to the economic downturn beginning in 2007. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg committed the city to making even greater cuts than required by Kyoto, pledging the city\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions would fall 30 percent below the 2005 level by 2030. \u201cThanks to the economic downturn, NYC got off to a good start. After 2012, however, emissions actually increased. At the current rate, New York will miss Bloomberg\u2019s 2030 target,\u201d writes Myers. Chicago\u2019s former mayor, Richard Daley, pledged the city would cut its carbon dioxide emissions 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, yet, \u201cthe city\u2019s \u2018Climate Action Plan\u2019 web page admits: \u2018If Chicago continues on its current path ... its emissions would grow to 39.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2020\u2019\u201d\u201422 percent above 1990 levels, or 62 percent above the promised target.\nHaving learned nothing from these woefully missed targets the mayors, or their replacements, are doubling down on their climate commitments, in effect saying, \u201ctrust us, this time we\u2019ll do better.\u201d Even if they can do better, their constituents should ask, at what cost? How much money and manpower should be diverted from schools, pensions, policing, and potholes to reduce carbon dioxide emissions?\nIn fact, mayors, city councils, and cities can do relatively little to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and hit the Paris targets. Electric power generation accounts for only about 20 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, yet that is the only segment of the economy on which cities could have some limited impact. Many municipalities own power stations built when coal was king. I doubt many elected officials will want to go before the voters having closed down a city-owned power station\u2014with its attendant loss of jobs and possibly higher energy costs\u2014but they could, at some cost, convert such power stations from coal to natural gas.\nStates, not cities, control or regulate the power supply within their borders. Cities can put some solar panels on rooftops of city buildings, purchase wind and solar energy through the grid (or at least buy renewable energy credits that purport to show someone, somewhere is building and purchasing wind or solar power, if not the actual city itself), plant trees, and buy natural gas or electric vehicles to reduce emissions, but none of these policies will really reduce emissions much.\nEvery thousand megawatts of intermittent renewable energy needs at least 700 megawatts of reliable energy, usually fossil fuel powered, to back it up. In addition, manufacturing, installing, and maintaining all those turbines and solar panels burns a lot of fossil fuel. Few cities have the home rule authority to impose carbon or energy taxes, and of those few with such power, I\u2019d love to see them sell higher energy prices to the voters.\nCities could implement new building codes with stricter energy efficiency standards, but expect the business community to get out the torches and pitchforks if that occurs, especially if they are forced to retrofit existing buildings out of their own pockets.\nAnd it\u2019s important to note all of these policies will impose higher costs on taxpayers, businesses, and/or consumers, with limited payback over time. Wind and solar electricity and electric vehicles cost more than more-reliable fossil-fuel-powered power plants and vehicles. States and European countries that have gone the farthest to cut carbon dioxide emissions pay two to three times more for energy than states and countries that rely primarily on fossil fuels for energy. And frankly, I don\u2019t want my police force (or hospital or fire emergency services) driving electric vehicles that cost 200 to 300 percent more than conventional fossil-fuel-powered vehicles and might run out of juice during criminal chases or emergency calls.\nMost importantly, I want to know what the hell these carbon-clown mayors are thinking: climate change as the issue local officials should be tackling, Really? I read daily how Chicago and Baltimore, among many other cities, have growing crime and murder rates. In many places, the relationship and trust between citizens and their police forces are at historic lows, with beat cops increasingly literally under fire. Cities around the country are facing budget crises, their streets are riddled with potholes, their bridges are crumbling, their public transit systems are breaking down, their sewage services are out of date, their school systems are failing (while teachers complain they are underpaid), they lack the funding to open municipal pools during the summer, they are closing libraries and cancelling summer reading programs for kids, and in many places public employee retirement funds are woefully underfunded. In Texas, where I live, the state is bailing out Dallas\u2019 police and fire departments\u2019 pension funds and literally closed Dallas County Schools\u2014not the school district but the county agency that provided bus and others services.\nRather than wasting time and resources fighting a likely non-problem (human-caused climate change), mayors should focus on solving the local issues they were elected to confront.\nRather than raising prices and taxes on citizens and businesses\u2014proven economic growth killers\u2014to pay for green, feel-good programs that will ultimately have no measurable effect on climate, they should take steps to make their cities more attractive to businesses and attract economic growth.\nMany of these guys and gals, who have the temerity to lecture Trump, the president of the United States, on climate matters, have run their cities into the ground and are going begging to the federal government for help in avoiding municipal bankruptcy, for increased school and health care funding, and to fix local roads and transit systems.\nDespite the hubris USCM\u2019s resolutions display, few mayors, if any, are climate or international policy experts. Mayors were elected to solve local problems \u2026 and if there was ever a problem that is not local, if it is a problem at all, it is global warming.\n\u2014 H.

Keqiang, Tusk, and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, met in Brussels June 1 through 2 to discuss closer trade ties between Europe and China.\nAccording to the Climate Observer, a draft of the joint communiqu\u00e9 on climate change expected to be announced at the end of the meeting was leaked before the summit. The draft statement said, \u201c\u2018[the] EU and China consider climate action and the clean energy transition an imperative more important than ever\u2019 and that they confirm their commitments to the Paris Agreement. The two global players expressed their intent to increase their cooperation and to \u2018work together with all stakeholders to combat climate change [\u2026] and promote global low GHG emissions, climate resilient and sustainable development.\u2019 They also pledged to set up new policies and measures to implement their nationally-determined contributions [emission reductions].\u201d\nYet, at summit\u2019s end no joint climate statement was released, as conflicts between the EU and China over various trade issues\u2014including the EU\u2019s refusal to drop a WTO investigation into allegations China is dumping below-cost steel into European markets\u2014stymied not just the climate communiqu\u00e9, but joint agreements on other topics, like North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, as well. As with so many of the climate disasters hyped by alarmists, The supposed joint commitment between China and the EU failed to materialize. National priorities overcame joint action. Of course, stories reporting the failure to agree didn\u2019t make the front page.\nSOURCES: Reuters; Irish Times; and Climate Observer\nAfter a steady increase in sea ice extent since the late 1970s, with summer and winter sea ice extent records being broken repeatedly in 2014 and again in 2015, sea ice declined sharply in Antarctica in late 2016. A new study shows, just like the multi-decade increase in Antarctic sea ice, the sharp decline is due to natural causes, not anthropogenic global warming.\nThe British Antarctic Survey\u2019s John Turner, lead author of the Geophysical Research Letters study, notes Antarctic sea ice is relatively thin, making it extremely vulnerable to strong winds. The researchers found Antarctica was hit with a series of strong storms from September through November 2016, which brought warm air and strong winds from the north, melting 30,000 square miles of ice per day\u2014the equivalent of losing a South Carolina-sized chunk of sea ice every 24 hours. As a result, by March 2017, Antarctica\u2019s sea ice extent reached its lowest recorded levels since satellites have been recording sea ice extent in 1978.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication this is anything but just natural variability,\u201d Turner said, according to Watts Up With That. \u201cIt highlights the fact that the climate of the Antarctic is incredibly variable.\u201d\\\nSOURCE: Watts Up With That", "label": 1}, "text-102": {"text": "There is no compelling reason for the United States to take drastic actions to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gases.\u201d There is little evidence that human activity is having more than a marginal impact on the Earth\u2019s climate and even less that moderate climate shifts will be disastrous for either human civilization or the environment.", "label": 1}, "text-103": {"text": "In a recent article in Forbes, Charles McConnell, executive director of Rice University\u2019s Energy and Environment Initiative, says what I and others at The Heartland Institute have long maintained: the United States is setting itself up for an entirely preventable energy disaster.\nMcConnell says the U.S. electric power grid is being stretched to the brink of failure from a major weather event or terror attack, as anti-climate policies and renewable energy subsidies and mandates force dependable nuclear and coal-fired power plants to close, replacing them with increasing amounts of less secure, less resilient, and less reliable sources of energy, such as wind, solar, or even natural gas.\nMcConnell\u2019s warning is particularly telling because it comes from a former assistant secretary of energy at the U.S. Energy Department for the Obama administration, the administration whose actions are largely responsible for the energy crisis the country is potentially facing.\nMcConnell writes, \u201cCoal and nuclear plants are unmatched in their ability to generate reliable energy under all circumstances, but these plants are being retired at an alarming rate because of a combination of punitive regulations, low natural gas prices, and government subsidies and mandates for renewables.\u201d As McConnell notes, coal and nuclear plants in the Midwest and Northeast running at full capacity were critical to keeping people\u2019s lights on and their homes heated during the polar vortex of 2014.\nMost Americans take electricity for granted. McConnell calls peoples\u2019 belief the U.S. electric power system can continue to remain reliable and resilient even as climate regulations and renewable energy mandates shut down coal and nuclear plants \u201cmagical thinking.\u201d\nElectricity cannot be reliably and inexpensively stored. Instead, it must be available whenever users demand it. Wind and solar power, which produce power only when nature cooperates, can\u2019t fit that bill.\nI\u2019m a fan of natural gas power. As gas prices have fallen, my electric bills have generally declined. Competition with natural gas plants is the primary reason some coal-fired power plants and nuclear plants have recently closed or are slated for early retirement. On cost alone, however, if one is concerned about price volatility, coal beats natural gas in many cases as a long-term fuel source. Unlike natural gas, the price of coal is less prone to rise or fall in response to weather or surging demand from alternative uses. This fact is reflected in my monthly power bills, where every bump in gas prices can double my monthly gas (winter) and electric (summer) bill.\nIn addition to price volatility, McConnell notes resilience and reliability during a crisis are a concern:\n[N]atural gas is less secure than coal and nuclear power because it relies on pipeline supply of fuel on demand.\nA base-load power plant typically stores in excess of a 30-day supply of coal on site, enough to outlast potential disruptions. Natural gas plants require a constant on-demand supply of gas to continue producing electricity [and] a weather shock, pipeline repair, unforeseen human mistake or a terror attack can quickly disrupt operations at those plants.\nMcConnell\u2019s article is timely, coming as The Heartland Institute has recently released our series of four studies demonstrating the continuing criticality of coal-fired power plants to grid reliability and price stability. These studies examine in detail the myriad regulatory factors and behind-the-scenes political machinations driving the premature retirement of dozens of valuable coal-fired power plants.\nAbsent federal action to account for the value of coal and nuclear plants\u2019 on-site storage capacity or governments ending their various subsidies for and mandates to use wind and solar power, people are likely to wake up from their fantasy land where electricity magically appears at the flick of a switch, instead finding the world a darker, colder (or hotter) place than they remembered, a world where electric power on demand is a luxury one can\u2019t count on.\nAmericans should ask the people of Venezuela, where my wife is from, for example, how that is working out.\n\u2014H. Sterling Burnett\nSOURCES: Forbes; Quanta Technology; The Heartland Institute\nIN THIS ISSUE \u2026\nSolar road a bust \u2026 Groundwater discharge contributes to rising seas \u2026 SEC blocks shareholder resolution\nSince 2014, a husband-and-wife team has raised nearly $4.5 million for a demonstration project, called \u201cSolar Roadways,\u201d to put solar panels on roads and parking lots. When they first announced the project, climate blogger Anthony Watts listed myriad reasons ir was a foolish idea, not the least of which were the high costs of infrastructure and the fact solar panels were not really suited to carry heavy traffic.\nThough Watts didn\u2019t mention it, I will: it also seems to me having cars parked on top of or traveling over the panels, since neither cars nor their occupants are translucent, would defeat the purpose of capturing the sunlight and transforming it into electricity. It\u2019s like putting solar panel on top of a home\u2019s foundation but underneath the home itself, not a lot of light is going to get through.\nIf this were solely a private project, I would have no objection, and I might even get a good laugh out of it. When people throw away their own money on inane attempts to fight climate change, it is nobody\u2019s business but their own. Unfortunately, there is rarely a foolish climate mitigation plan federal or state governments won\u2019t take hard money from taxpayers to promote, and Solar Roadways is no exception. The project\u2019s developers were able to convince the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to give them more than $2,350,000 of hard-earned taxpayer money in Small Business Innovation Research grants for the project.\nThe developers had to replace the first two sets of solar panels on the test roadway in Sandpoint, Idaho in short order. \u201cTwenty-five of the first thirty test panels died within the first few weeks,\u201d writes Willie Eschenbach at Watts Up with That. \u201cThey were replaced by panels that delaminated. \u2026 So the delaminated panels were replaced again. But to be fair, who would have ever guessed that driving loaded semi-trucks over solar panels might do some damage?\u201d\nDuring the solar project\u2019s first 378 days of operation, the system produced about 246 kWh of electricity. Eschenbach calculates, based on the 15 cents per kWh he pays for electricity in California (where, due to climate policies, the cost of electricity is much more than what many people pay around the country; I pay 7.8 cents per kWh, for example), the solar project produced $36.86 worth of electricity at a cost of $4,450,000. What a costly boondoggle.\nSOURCE: Watts Up With That\nJim Steele, author of Landscapes and Cycles, published a new paper on Climate Etc. arguing groundwater discharge into the oceans is contributing to sea level rise. This is a missing factor unaccounted for by climate models. Once properly accounted for, the amount of sea level rise attributable to anthropogenic warming is much less than climate models estimate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges it cannot account for as much as 25 percent of the sea level rise. The IPCC\u2019s 2002 report stated, \u201cthe historic rise started too early, has too linear a trend, and is too large.\u201d\nGroundwater slowly discharges into the oceans over time, with the rate and amount varying dependent on periodic shifts in ocean currents, rainfall amounts, and rates of aquifer recharge, among other factors. Climate models do not take into account groundwater discharge into the world\u2019s oceans, yet the volume of fresh water stored as groundwater is second only to the amount of water frozen in Antarctica\u2019s icy expanse, and it is three to eight times the amount of water contained in Greenland\u2019s glaciers.\nOn relatively short time scales, during periods of frequent La Ni\u00f1as, a greater proportion of precipitation falls on the land globally \u201cand when routed through more slowly discharging aquifers, sea level rise decelerates. During periods of more frequent El Ni\u00f1os, more rain falls back onto the oceans, and sea level rise accelerates. In contrast to La Ni\u00f1a induced shallow-aquifer effects, deep aquifers have been filled with meltwater from the last Ice Age, and that water is slowly and steadily seeping back into the oceans today,\u201d writes Steele.\nAs Steele explains in detail, deep aquifers are constantly discharging water into oceans, and \u201cprimarily regulated by geological pore spaces (in addition to pressure heads), the slow and steady discharge of these older waters affects sea level rise on century and millennial timeframes.\u201d This discharge could account for a large portion of, if not all, unaccounted-for sea level rise.\nUntil climate models account for the volume of water the world\u2019s shallow and deep aquifers discharge into the oceans, the amount of sea level rise they attribute to human causes should be considered inaccurate.\nSOURCE: Climate Etc.\nIn an unprecedented decision, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supported oil producer EOG Resources\u2019 request to be allowed to kill a shareholder resolution on climate change preemptively, without a vote. The SEC\u2019s action could indicate a significant shift in the way it analyzes shareholder resolutions under the administration of President Donald Trump.\nOn behalf of the Sierra Club Foundation, Trillium Asset Management, the oldest investment management firm pushing social and environmental change through stock ownership, proposed a shareholder resolution calling on EOG to set a target and timetable to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Trillium, founded in 1982, manages approximately $2.5 billion in assets.\nIn a December 20, 2017 letter to SEC, EOG requested the commission allow it to exclude Trillium\u2019s resolution in the proxy materials it was required to send to shareholders for consideration at its annual meeting, and to preclude it from coming up for a vote at the meeting. Citing SEC rules, EOG stated Trillium\u2019s resolution interfered with matters\nso fundamental to management\u2019s ability to run a company on a day-to-day basis that they could not, as a practical matter, be subject to direct shareholder oversight, [and] \u2026the proposal seeks to \u2018micro-manage\u2019 the company by probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.\nSEC agreed with EOG. In its February 26 letter responding to EOG\u2019s request, SEC said Trillium\u2019s proposal does attempt to \u201cmicromanage the Company,\u201d and thus under Commission rules, the agency allowed EOG to exclude the resolution from its annual meeting proxy materials and prevent it from being voted on.\nSEC\u2019s decision came after the agency issued new legal guidance in November 2017 broadening the definition of micromanagement as potential grounds to block shareholder proposals. Since 2010, nearly 130 resolutions have been filed asking companies to set timetables and/or standards for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or take other actions to fight climate change. Shareholders have rejected most such resolutions, usually by large margins.\nAccording to The Sustainable Investments Institute, historically SEC has disallowed similar climate shareholder resolutions only based on technical errors, such as filing the resolution late.

This risk is \u201can existential threat to civilisation\u201d, they say, meaning \u201cwe are in a state of planetary emergency\u201d.\nTipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests. In the past, extreme heating of 5C was thought necessary to pass tipping points, but the latest evidence suggests this could happen between 1C and 2C.\nThe planet has already heated by 1C and the temperature is certain to rise further, due to past emissions and because greenhouse gas levels are still rising. The scientists further warn that one tipping point, such as the release of methane from thawing permafrost, may fuel others, leading to a cascade.\nThe researchers, writing in a commentary article in the journal Nature, acknowledge that the complex science of tipping points means great uncertainty remains. But they say the potential damage from the tipping points is so big and the time to act so short, that \u201cto err on the side of danger is not a responsible option\u201d. They call for urgent international action.\n\u201cA saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping could still be under our control to some extent,\u201d they write. \u201cThe stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action \u2013 not just words \u2013 must reflect this.\u201d\nProf Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, the lead author of the article, said: \u201cWe might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of interrelated tipping points. The simple version is the schoolkids [striking for climate action] are right: we are seeing potentially irreversible changes in the climate system under way, or very close.\u201d\n\u201cAs a scientist, I just want to tell it how it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not trying to be alarmist, but trying to treat the whole climate change problem as a risk management problem. It is what I consider the common sense way.\u201d\nPhil Williamson at the University of East Anglia, who did not contribute to the article, said: \u201cThe prognosis by Tim Lenton and colleagues is, unfortunately, fully plausible: that we might have already lost control of the Earth\u2019s climate.\u201d\nThe new article comes as the UN warns action is very far from stopping global temperature rise, with the world currently on track for 3C-4C. The commentary lists nine tipping points that may have been activated.\n\u201cWe have this alarming evidence that part of the west Antarctic ice sheet may be in irreversible retreat,\u201d said Lenton. \u201cAll the signals are that it is.\u201d A similar situation appears to be occurring at the Wilkes basin in east Antarctica. The collapse of these ice sheets would eventually raise sea level by many metres.\nThe massive Greenland ice sheet was melting at an accelerating rate, the scientists said, while Arctic sea ice is shrinking fast. \u201cPermafrost across the Arctic is beginning to irreversibly thaw and release carbon dioxide and methane,\u201d they said.\nThe Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic, which warms Europe, has also slowed by 15% since the mid-20th century. \u201cThat is just about in the range of natural variability, but it is also hard to rule out that it is part of a longer downturn,\u201d Lenton said.\nThe scientists report that 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been lost since 1970. The tipping point, where loss of forest leads to it drying out, could lie in the range 20%-40%, they said. In temperate forests, especially in North America, heating has triggered more fires and pest outbreaks, potentially turning some regions from a sink for carbon to a source. In the tropics, corals are predicted to be wiped out by 2C of heating.\nA cascade of tipping points could occur because, for example, the melting of Arctic sea ice amplifies heating by exposing dark ocean that absorbs more sunlight. That may increase the melting of Greenland ice and permafrost areas. \u201cMultiple risks can interact, with one change reinforcing another, and with warming of just a degree or two sufficient to result in dramatic cascading effects,\u201d said Williamson.\nProf Martin Siegert, at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThe new work is valuable. They are being a little speculative, but maybe you need to be.\u201d He pointed out that the extremely rapid rate at which CO2 was being pumped into the atmosphere was unlikely to have ever occurred on Earth before. \u201cIt may mean that tipping points can occur in unexpected ways as there is no geological precedent for this rate of CO2 change.\u201d\nThe article reports that preliminary results from the latest climate models suggest global heating will be greater than expected, increasing the risk of tipping points. Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, disagreed on that point. However, he added: \u201cI completely endorse their call for action. Although possibly low probability, the risks they identify are real.\u201d\nLenton said action would still have real benefits, by slowing the impacts and giving more time for people to adapt. He said: \u201cThis article is not meant to be a counsel of despair. If we want to avoid the worst of these bad climate tipping points, we need to activate some positive social and economic tipping points [such as renewable energy] towards what should ultimately be a happier, flourishing, sustainable future for the generations to come.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-106": {"text": "Coalition MPs split over Scott Morrison's apparent shift on climate policy\nModerate Liberals have seized on Scott Morrison\u2019s apparent shift on climate change policy to argue the government will do more to cut emissions, as some conservatives push back against any \u201csymbolism\u201d that could damage the economy.\nIn a sign of the challenge facing the prime minister as he seeks to \u201cevolve\u201d climate change policy, government MPs have split over the prime minister\u2019s comments on the weekend that the Coalition wanted to reduce emissions \u201ceven further\u201d than current commitments.\nWhile saying Australia\u2019s 2030 emission reduction targets remain government policy, Morrison said he wanted to do \u201cbetter\u201d and would only rely on the use of carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol if needed.\nAustralia is the only country relying on carryover credits to meet its Paris 2030 target of 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2030, which critics say do not represent the cuts required to limit global warming to as close to 1.5C as possible.\nKatie Allen, the Liberal MP for the Victorian seat of Higgins, welcomed Morrison\u2019s remarks, telling her constituents that she would be a \u201cstrong voice\u201d in the party room for stronger action on climate change.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited we are starting to move in the right direction \u2013 but we have a lot more to do,\u201d Allen told her supporters on Facebook.\n\u201cI have been and will continue to be a strong voice for Climate Action inside the tents.\u201d\nWhen asked if she supported the aim of net zero emissions by 2050 and lifting \u201cclean energy ambitions\u201d in line with the global efforts to keep the world below 1.5C warming, Allen said she agreed more needed to be done.\n\u201cI\u2019m working on influencing that agenda.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO\u00a0say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The\u00a0Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre\u00a0says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.\nDry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.\u00a0\nDryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.\nThe year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.\nNot a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.\nNSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.\nAnother moderate Liberal, Jason Falinski, said the party would continue to \u201cdrive responsible policy on climate change\u201d.\n\u201cWe need practical and sensible policy here and seek ambitious action globally,\u201d he said.\nBut as moderates welcomed the shift, conservative MPs were warning against a change in policy.\nThe Queensland Nationals MP Llew O\u2019Brien told the Courier Mail that if Australia went beyond its current commitments, it would be \u201cpure symbolism at the expense of the economy\u201d.\nThe former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce also issued a thinly veiled warning that the government risked a backlash in the bush if it moved to ramp up emission reduction targets.\n\u201cTo the person in the weatherboard and iron, the solution is not: you\u2019ll lose your job and we\u2019ll put up your power prices, because that is not a solution, that is another problem,\u201d Joyce told Guardian Australia.\nJoyce said the royal commission into the bushfires needed to be \u201cabsolutely pragmatic\u201d in its focus, looking at how to prevent a repeat of the crisis without straying to \u201cglobal\u201d issues.\n\u201cIf it goes off on a path of a macro global view, it will not ultimately bring people together, it will tear people apart,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGlobal outcomes must be managed globally.\u201d\nThe divide comes as Morrison insists the role of climate change is \u201cnot in dispute\u201d within his ranks, despite several MPs denying the role of a warmer planet as an underlying cause of the severe bushfire season.\nThe Nationals MP George Christensen was the latest to promote his view that climate change was not a factor, telling his supporters on Facebook that climate change is not \u201ca bogey man who can go around lighting bushfires\u201d.\n\u201cI post this because those who are politicising this tragedy by pushing their extreme green political agenda while the fires still burn absolutely disgust me,\u201d he said.\nThe Liberal MP Craig Kelly last week caused a storm of controversy after appearing on UK television to argue that there was \u201cno link\u201d between climate change and Australia\u2019s drought.\nFollowing the appearance, Morrison told his MPs that backbenchers should not do any international media interviews.", "label": 0}, "text-107": {"text": "irish overview of latest climate science  for policy makers\nContinue Reading...", "label": 1}, "text-108": {"text": "New climate tests for pipelines are unnecessary\n\nThe federal government is about to roll out new regulatory requirements for Canada\u2019s energy industry. The new rules will require the environmental reviews of pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals\u2014critical energy infrastructure projects\u2014to consider the greenhouse gas (GHGs) effects of those projects.\n\nThe move to have pipelines and LNG terminals pass climate change tests raises many questions. How will the tests be conducted? What will be the standards that proposed projects must pass? Will the tests result in \u201csocial license\u201d for projects?\n\nBut most importantly, are these new regulatory requirements necessary? Do pipelines and LNG terminals increase emissions enough to realistically effect climate change? The answer to these last two questions is no.\n\nContrary to much of the environmental ire levelled against Canada\u2019s oilsands, the GHGs produced by extracting oil from them represents but a sliver\u20140.1 per cent\u2014of global emissions.\n\nEven expansion of the oilsands would likely have a minimal impact on GHGs. In 2014, when the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that oilsands production would increase by more than three million barrels a day over the next 25 years, the now executive director of the IEA said, \u201cthe emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China\u2014not even one day.\u201d\n\nAnd that was probably an understatement. According to recent reports, China has been burning up to 17 per cent more coal a year than had been thought, with early estimates indicating that China likely released about 900 million metric tons more CO2 from 2011 to 2013. To put this into perspective, Alberta recently placed a cap on oilsands emissions equivalent to 100 million metric tons.\n\nGiven that the total impact of the oilsands on emissions is relatively low, the effects of any one pipeline would be even smaller. Climate scientist Paul Knappenberger gives us a sense of just how small of an impact a single pipeline would have on emissions.\n\nFor his congressional testimony on the Keystone XL pipeline, Knappenberger used estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the additional emissions that may result if the pipeline gets built. Using a climate model developed with the support of the EPA, Knappenberger calculated that \u201cthe average temperature rise works out to less than 0.00001 degree C per year. That is 1/100,000 of a degree.\u201d\n\nIn fact, transporting oil by pipeline may actually lower GHG emissions. In its review of Keystone XL, the U.S. State Department found that, depending on the scenario (only rail, rail/pipeline or rail/tanker), transportation alternatives to Keystone XL could increase annual CO2 emissions from transport by 27.8 per cent and 41.8 per cent.\n\nIt\u2019s not only pipelines that will be subjected to climate change tests, so too will LNG terminals. British Columbia\u2019s LNG industry has already been hampered by costly regulatory delays, which may result in the province forgoing export revenues of C$22.5 billion per year in 2020, rising to C$24.8 billion per year in 2025 if the industry does not get off the ground. The new regulatory requirements may only further the delays.\n\nAgain, the irony here is that natural gas has the potential to significantly reduce GHGs by displacing coal-fired electricity in places such as China, which consumed more than 50 per cent of global coal consumption in 2014. In the United States, switching from coal to natural gas for electricity is estimated to be responsible for 19 per cent of the reduction of CO2 emissions that has taken place in the U.S. since 2007.\n\nThe effect of pipelines and LNG terminals on climate change is negligible at worst and positive at best, based on their ability to actually reduce GHG emissions. The new climate change tests are unnecessary and will add to the regulatory barriers and compliance costs that Canadian energy faces.", "label": 1}, "text-109": {"text": "the disgraceful use of children to promote the climate change delusion\nDr Jay Lehr and Tom Harris post at www.americaoutloud.com: \"The climate crusade, promoting a world-wide delusion for which there exists not a shred of physical evidence, is again using children.

COP26 is regarded by many as one of the last realistic chances to put the world on track to meet the Paris goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of global heating are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.\nClimate campaigners are concerned that the UK has got off to a slow start both in its hosting of the conference and in its own actions to reach the target of net zero emissions by 2050, enshrined in law under Theresa May\u2019s government last summer.\nJohn Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian: \u201cMichael Gove is not usually a man lost for words, given he is perhaps the best debater in government.

When the University tried to stop Dr Ridd doing this, Dr Ridd spoke out against University management \u2013 making all the documentation public including on his new website.\nI would really like the court case to be about academic freedom and the science \u2013 to lay bare the evidence.  But when I went to the first day of the hearing of an application in the Federal Circuit Court last Monday (11th June \u2013 the hearing continued on 12 June 2018) for an order for reinstatement of Dr Ridd\u2019s employment pending determination at trial, it quickly became evident that there would be no testing of the actual scientific evidence relied upon by Dr Ridd to claim that scientific institutions like AIMS and ARC Centre \u201ccan no longer be trusted\u201d and \u201cspin their story\u201d.\nYesterday (19th June), Judge Jarrett gave his reasons for making orders declining to reinstate Dr Ridd but allowing him to amend his primary application to include a claim for the university taking \u201cadverse action\u201d against him for exercising a workplace right (i.e. his intellectual/academic freedom pursuant to the enterprise agreement). On hearing the reasons I was concerned to discover that it may all come down to poorly worded clauses in an enterprise agreement.  In particular, was Dr Ridd allowed to exercise his academic freedoms free of the constraint of the university\u2019s \u2018aspirational\u2019 (according to His Honour) code of conduct, and was he permitted to say anything publicly about what many ordinary Australians would consider a straight-forward case of the university bullying him into silence?\nOn the first day of the preliminary hearing Barrister Ben Kidston for the applicant (Dr Ridd) argued eloquently about how the case was about \u2018academic freedom\u2019.  He went-on for over an hour moving from the big picture to the detail with respect to specific clauses in a code of conduct and the enterprise agreement, and back again.  All the while His Honour and the audience listened intently \u2013 no one interrupted.   Again yesterday, His Honour cited the poorly worded specific clause which  the university has been relying on to silence Dr Ridd, and observed that it was open to two interpretations.\nHis Honour didn\u2019t mention the Union.  The National Tertiary Education Union has an interest in the enterprise agreement and like Dr Ridd, they say that the relevant clause in the agreement shouldn\u2019t be used to silence the employee but rather, amongst other things, that the obligation of confidentiality only applies to the University\u2019s management of the disciplinary process.    Any other interpretation means that university academics would be obliged to suffer any disciplinary action by the University (legitimate or otherwise) in silence \u2013 they would never be able to publicly defend themselves in the court of public opinion, court proceedings being the only practical option.  One wonders if the Union realises the implications to its members.\nYesterday, when His Honour gave his reasons for declining the application by Dr Ridd for an injunction \u2013 for his temporary reinstatement as a Professor at James Cook University pending the trial \u2013 he didn\u2019t deal with many of the arguments advanced for Dr Ridd e.g. the effect of the clause of the enterprise agreement which states that the code of conduct is not to \u201cdetract\u201d from the intellectual freedoms, the interaction of the express right to disagree with the University\u2018s decisions and processes pursuant to his intellectual freedom and the purported obligation to keep disciplinary proceedings again him confidential, whether a conflict of interest, apprehended bias or actual bias, exists by reason of the university\u2019s commercial relationship with AIMS, GBRMPA and ARC and the effect that this has on the obligation to afford Dr Ridd procedural fairness and natural justice in the determination of the disciplinary complaint (which concerned comments he made about those bodies).\nThat is not intended to be critical of His Honour. His Honour took a broad brush approach and did not descend into the detail of the arguments and the evidence, as all His Honour was required to do was to ascertain whether Dr Ridd had a prima facie case, and not to decide the case itself.\nYesterday, His Honour found that Dr Ridd had an arguable prima facie case in relation to the alleged breach of the enterprise agreement by JCU and that it took adverse action against him, but that the balance of convenience did not favour his reinstatement pending trial primarily because:\n1. an award of damages would be an adequate remedy if Dr Ridd was successful at trial; and\n2. the university paid Dr Ridd the equivalent of six month\u2019s pay upon his termination \u2013 so he was not presently without income to support himself and (it seems) that a trial would likely occur before the expiration of that six month period; and\n3. Dr Ridd had previously turned down an offer of an undertaking by the university  to suspend the disciplinary proceedings pending determination of the proceeding. It is important to note that that undertaking would have required Dr Ridd to remain silent about the disciplinary proceedings that had been taken against him by the university.\nOf course, in making this determination the Judge was entirely ignoring (as he was entitled to) the very nature of Dr Ridd \u2013 a man of integrity who will not be silenced even if costs him his job, his career and results in vicious bullying.\nWhen Christopher Murdoch QC for the respondent (JCU) argued on the first day of the hearing he explained that the University\u2019s core issue was the breaking of confidentiality, in particular Dr Ridd was not allowed to tell anyone that he had been censured.  Never mind that he had been censured for daring to speak out against a culture where scientific integrity is perhaps sacrificed for profit.\nSo, when I blogged about this issue of Peter Ridd being censured and the need for everyone to contribute to his GoFundMe Campaign back in May, I very deliberately emphasised the importance of being able to speak out.   The most important thing, I wrote, is to not be silenced.\nI was also thinking of the famous Edmund Burke quote: The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\nDr Ridd has done something.   First, he detailed the scientific facts as an expert on these issues including in the scientific literature.  For example, there is his article published in Marine Geology (Volume 346, pages 392-399) in which he explains that the only reason Glenn De\u2019ath found an apparent decline in coral calcification rates was because he didn\u2019t consider the age effect on coral growth.

In a report released late yesterday it acknowledged issues with the performance of just two of these: Goulburn Airport (Goulburn) and Thredbo Top Station (Thredbo). These are the same two weather stations that I reported at my blog were not recording temperatures measured below minus 10 degrees on the 5th and 18th July, respectively.\nWhile the Bureau strenuously denied it was setting limits, the Minister Josh Frydenberg nevertheless insisted on a review of the entire AWS network.\nThe Minister phoned me late yesterday to let me know that the report had just been published, and that the Bureau\u2019s investigations confirmed that Goulburn and Thredbo were the only sites where temperature records had been affected by the inability of some Bureau AWS to read low temperatures.\nWhat are the chances? Of the nearly 700 weather stations, I stumbled across the only two with problems.\nGoulburn was discovered because my friend Lance Pidgeon lives nearby and was up early on the morning of 2 July concerned his pipes were going to freeze and burst \u2013 while watching the live AWS temperature readings tick-over on that weather station, then letting me know when the record for July of minus 10.4 was reached: only to see it rounded up to minus 10.0.\nThredbo was discovered because, after making a fuss about Goulburn, I wanted to check that the Bureau had actually lifted the limits on readings below minus 10. So, two weeks later I decided to get up early and watch the one-second reading at one of the stations in the snow fields on the Sunday morning of 16th July thinking it might be a cold morning. Why did I choose Thredbo \u2013 of all the weather stations in the Australian Alps? Simply because my school friend Diane Ainsworth died in the landslide there twenty years ago.\nNever mind \u2013 I\u2019m vindicated!\nThe Bureau has now acknowledged that it had inadvertently set limits on how cold temperatures could be recorded at Goulburn and Thredbo.\nTo be clear the equipment has a general operating range to minus 60 degrees Celsius, but smart card readers \u2013 with a nominal range to only minus 10 degrees Celsius and that stop reading all together at minus 10.4 \u2013 were inserted placing limits on the actual recordings, not the measurements.\nAccording to the report published late yesterday, the cards were inserted into the Goulburn weather station in September 2002, and into the Thredbo weather station in May 2007. So, for a period of nearly 15 years there has been a limit on how cold temperatures can be recorded at Goulburn, and for nearly 10 years at Thredbo.\nThis Goulburn weather station was first opened in 1990, and had previously recorded temperatures below minus 10 degrees Celsius in 1994,1999 and 2000 \u2013 with a record cold minus 10.9 recorded on 17 August 1994.\nThe Thredbo weather station opened in 1966, and recorded an average of 2.5 days per year below minus 10 degrees until 1996 when an automatic weather station was installed \u2013 replacing the previous liquid-in-glass manually-read thermometers.\nSince the AWS was first installed, back in April 1997 there has been a reduction in the average number of days per year when temperatures have fallen below minus 10 degrees Celsius, as shown in the chart.\nFurther, since May 2007 when the MSI2 sensor interface card was replaced with the MSI1 card (see page 50 of the new report from the Bureau) there has been no potential to record below minus 10.4.  Yet not far from this location, at Charlotte Pass, an all-time record low temperature of minus 23 degree Celsius was recorded on 29 June 1994; this was with an old style liquid-in-glass thermometer \u2013 not with an AWS.\nHow can this review possibly conclude that there are no problems with the other 693 automatic weather stations \u2013 and there has been no impact on official temperature records from the limits it now acknowledges were placed on recordings from Thredbo and Goulburn?\nSurely, there is now evidence enough for a proper external review to be initiated, this should be a Parliamentary Enquiry, through the House Energy and Environment Committee.", "label": 1}, "text-117": {"text": "Politics makes Liberal allsorts of us all\nRichard Wilson (Letters, 4 December) is incorrect when he states that Michael Heseltine stood as a National Liberal in the 1959 general election and implies that he has returned to the Liberal fold.\nBy 1959, the term \u201cLiberal\u201d was used by some Conservatives, most of whom had no connection with British liberalism, in a variety of ways.

These labels were sometimes used to acknowledge previous mergers of National Liberal and Conservative associations but were often used with no justification whatsoever.\nIn an interview with David Dutton for his authoritative history of the National Liberals, Heseltine, who stood as a Conservative and National Liberal, said that the use of \u201cNational Liberal\u201d was just a \u201chistoric relic; it played no part in the campaign\u201d.\nThe historic Liberal party described such Conservative candidates as \u201cliquorice allsorts\u201d.

That includes the second Jeremy Corbyn gave it in his opening statement. When it was finally discussed \u2013 for a scant 45 seconds in the last 10 minutes \u2013 Corbyn was heckled after highlighting the effects our changing climate would have on the world\u2019s poorest, with a jeer of \u201cOh, here we go!\u201d. For those of us who work on raising awareness and finding solutions to the climate crisis, it was chilling. Corbyn himself looked shocked and seemed to gesture to the audience as if to say, \u201cSee what I\u2019m working with?\u201d\nThe urgency required to deal with our environmental crisis means this has to be the climate election\nImplied in the audience intervention was the idea that caring about the plight of the world\u2019s poorest is the preserve of tiresome, do-gooding snowflakes. Who cares about the people at the whims of climate change-related extreme weather events? They\u2019re on the other side of the world anyway, right? \nThankfully, it is increasingly a minority of Brits who laugh off the climate crisis. Just this week Ipsos Mori noted that, when asked to list the most important issues facing Britain today, the environment and pollution had leapt up the chart, with 21% of respondents saying it was important to them. This is its highest recorded score since July 1990, a six-percentage-point rise from September, pushing this topic into fourth place (after Brexit, health and crime but above education, inequality, housing, the economy and immigration). Similarly, polling from YouGov at the end of last month shows a majority of voters say climate change will influence the way they vote. For under-25s, it\u2019s near three-quarters.\nBut we clearly can\u2019t rely on demographic changes to push the dial towards climate action. We need action now. Climate activists always say this, but what we do in the next few years really is vital. The urgency required to deal with our environmental crisis means this has to be the climate election, whether we\u2019d rather be talking about Brexit or not.\nThe heckle seemed to derive from the view that the Labour leader is a bleeding-heart liberal who puts Brits last. Without wanting to suggest he should cave in to nationalist rhetoric at the first sign of resistance, Corbyn might well have avoided this by pulling the conversation back to a more domestic frame, skewering the prime minister on the recent floods, the Tories\u2019 near-ban on onshore wind or their lack of action on cold, uninsulated homes. The Labour leader did move on to refer to \u201cunusual weather patterns\u201d and extreme air pollution in the UK, as well give a plug to Labour\u2019s \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, but it seemed almost like an afterthought. I\u2019m sure in his post-debate debrief he was told this was a missed opportunity, and many of my fellow activists in the climate movement might be taking this as a sign that we need to be careful to always speak to domestic concerns first.\nAnd yet, at the same time, we can\u2019t keep sugar-coating the impact of our emissions on the rest of the world. We should be able to have a grown-up national debate on the climate crisis as an issue of global inequality, including the often exploitative and damaging role the UK has played. And why not have it at a point when voters are at their most engaged and politicised?\nThe sort of ambitious climate action we need in order to limit the damage globally is going to be difficult. It will require radical action against the big oil corporations \u2013 but it also means a change in our individual behaviour and routines too. We need drastically heightened levels of tree planting \u2013 it can\u2019t just be a few more saplings here and there \u2013 and that\u2019s going to mean more of us eating less meat. We need to cut flying, and driving too, and change our heaters and cookers. It\u2019s vital we get these conversations right or they could go sour, fast.\nAnd although comments like those made in the leaders\u2019 debate are beyond the pale, changing hearts and minds will have to involve challenging parochial approaches to climate action too. We need to do this well. Protests for climate action have been extremely powerful in the last year, and will no doubt continue to be so throughout the election and into next year. Looking ahead, we may be better served by a community-organising approach, one that focuses more on personal relationships and, above all, listening to people across the UK, rather than simply shouting our campaign messages ever louder. Older people who may not identify with environmental protest groups need to be listened to, engaged with and have clearly explained to them the ramifications of inaction on climate change. Otherwise, jeers such as \u201cOh, here we go!\u201d could be just the beginning of a climate crisis culture war, where eco-fascism rises to the surface.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean simply agreeing to views we find abhorrent, but neither does it mean dismissing them in the way Corbyn\u2019s \u201cSee what I\u2019m working with?\u201d gesture seemed to imply either. We need conversations, genuine ones where we listen to each other, and we need to be bold enough to go out and have them with people we disagree with. We can speak to a variety of values and approaches when it comes to climate change without pandering to banal nationalism. But we need to listen to them and \u2013 above all \u2013 involve them in the changes our society needs to avert climate catastrophe.\n\u2022 Alice Bell is co-director at climate change charity Possible and is writing a book on the history of the climate crisis.", "label": 0}, "text-119": {"text": "Newstart recipients six times more likely to suffer poor health, researchers find\nLast year, Tamara Burt had to reschedule her job agency appointments five times in a row.

She thinks it might be chronic fatigue syndrome but she also has a range of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\u201cIf I go out for just as much as an hour, I end up feeling really woeful for at least three days,\u201d she said.\nOn Monday, a new study will confirm Burt\u2019s story is likely a common one.\nThe study shows Newstart recipients are six times more likely to face poor health outcomes and suffer an \u201cincreased prevalence of disease in multiple categories\u201d.\nIn what researchers describe as the first report to look at broad health outcomes for Newstart and disability support pension recipients, the Monash University study finds these people reported \u201cstark\u201d differences in their health outcomes compared with those in paid work.\nAustralia\u2019s 700,000 Newstart recipients were more likely to be hospitalised than wage earners, more often reported \u201cmental and behavioural problems\u201d and generally faced an \u201cincreased burden of ill health\u201d.\nThe lead researcher, Prof Alex Collie, told Guardian Australia that an increase in the rate of the unemployment benefit could turn these health outcomes around and help get people back into work.\nUsing data from the National Health Survey, the researchers were able to analyse self-reported health conditions, and the use of health services and medicines among Newstart and the disability pension recipients compared to those earning a wage.\nKey findings of the study include:\nNewstart recipients were 6.8 times as likely to described their own health as poor. Those on the disability pension were 18.3 times more likely to report poor health.\nNearly half (48.6%) of Newstart recipients reported \u201cmental or behavioural problems\u201d, compared with 21% among wage earners.\nBoth disability pensioners and Newstart recipients were significantly more likely to report having five or more conditions than wage earners.\nNewstart recipients were at 1.5 to 2 times increased risk than wage earners of hospitalisation.\n70% of disability pensioners reported a behavioural condition, despite only 16% saying it was their primary disability.\nThe report comes as the Morrison government faces growing calls to increase the rate of the Newstart allowance, which is currently $277.85 a week \u2013 or about $40 a day \u2013 for a single person. The Australian Medical Association called for an increase to Newstart in July.\nCollie said while overseas research found one of the reasons people went on to government benefits was ill health, the situation was compounded by poverty and financial stress.\n\u201cMy personal view is that an increase in the rate of Newstart would help people to become more healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would help them to afford the things that a lot of us take for granted like food and housing, which are important things if you\u2019re trying to be healthy.\n\u201cAnd not doing just means we\u2019re putting those people in positions where it\u2019s less likely that they\u2019re going to be able to live a healthy life.\u201d\nThe report also found people on government benefits were less likely to attend health professionals where there were out of pocket costs, such as the dentist or a physical therapist.\nBurt last went to a dentist was about five years ago. \u201cThat wound up being a birthday present from my grandfather,\u201d she said.\nShe has struggled to afford her mobility scooter and to see specialists who do not bulk bill and her mental health plan only allows her 10 sessions with a psychologist a year before she needs to pay.\nThe researchers argue that Australia\u2019s welfare and health systems are not well-linked. Collie said there were multiple assessments welfare recipients underwent to determine their eligibility for payments.\n\u201c[These could be] used to identify the health needs of that person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might trigger action in the healthcare system, to make sure that person\u2019s health needs are being addressed.\u201d\nGuardian Australia reported in April that the number of sick and disabled people who were on Newstart rather than the disability pension had reached a record high 200,000.\n\u201cOur prediction is that because of the changes to the rules around who gets access to the DSP, and who gets access to Newstart, that there that will be an increase in poor health in both of those groups,\u201d Collie said.\nBurt said she could not get on to the disability pension because she was \u201cnot considered disabled enough\u201d.\n\u201cMy condition is not diagnosed so that makes it really hard as well,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended getting the form, I ended up going through and filling out what I could, and it\u2019s like, \u2018I can\u2019t fill it out any further here\u2019.

She examined data from across the globe to study the effects of people being socially isolated or lonely, or living alone.\nLoneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%\n\u201cEach of these significantly predict risk for premature death,\u201d Holt-Lunstad said.\n\u201cLoneliness increases earlier death by 26%, social isolation by 29% and living alone by 32%.\u201d\nHolt-Lunstad didn\u2019t find that one cause of death was more prevalent than another. The risk of every cause of death \u2013 including heart disease, cancer, stroke, renal failure \u2013 increased from isolation.\nA period of a few weeks in isolation should not lead to the inflammation and risk of cardiovascular trouble that Holt-Lunstad described. People could still see an impact on their health, however.\n\u201cWe do have evidence that these [periods of shorter isolation] can have immediate and short-term kinds of effects on our physiology. But, for instance, if your blood pressure is elevated acutely, that\u2019s going to have a different kind of an effect than if your blood pressure\u2019s elevated chronically,\u201d Holt-Lunstad said.\n\u201cFor those with underlying pre-existing conditions, those acute elevations might precipitate some sort of acute event. But for most of the rest of us, who may not have some kind of underlying condition, we hope that this would just be acute and wouldn\u2019t have these long-term effects.\u201d\nOne of the reasons people can suffer in social isolation is because personal relationships can help us cope with stress, Holt-Linstad said.\n\u201cFor instance: the ongoing uncertainty of what\u2019s going on right now in the world, your body\u2019s response to that may differ. Depending on the extent to which you feel like you have the resources you need to cope with that. And that in large part may be dependent on whether or not you feel like you have others in your life you can rely on. That you\u2019ve got someone who has your back or you can count on, or you can get through it together.\u201d\nDhruv Khullar, a physician and researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said short periods of isolation can cause increase anxiety or depression \u201cwithin days\u201d.\n\u201cWe have evolved to be social creatures. For all the history of humanity, people have been in family structures, people have been in groups, we\u2019re evolved to kind of crave and rely on that interaction with other human beings,\u201d Khullar said.\n\u201cSo when we don\u2019t have that it\u2019s a huge void in the way that we go about being human. This is something that has been kind of hard-wired into who we are as beings.\u201d\nKhullar, who stressed the crackdown on social gatherings was necessary, said people do at least have a wealth of options to stay connected. Texting, video calling or even the phone could potentially help avert the sense of isolation or loneliness, Khullar said.\n\u201cTech isn\u2019t a perfect substitute. Physical contact, being face to face with people, there\u2019s all sorts of subtle social cues that we pick up on that we rely on, that are ingrained in us over generations and millennia,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I do think you can get part of the way there by engaging with others digitally. I think the richer the format, probably the better \u2013 so a phone call is better than a text, a video conference is probably better than a phone call.\u201d\nOlder people, who are more at risk of Covid-19, may be less technologically savvy, and may have fewer connections to begin with. They might not be able to video conference or even send a text message. Khullar said it was important to reassure them that help is at hand.\n\u201cLet\u2019s look out for the people that are most vulnerable,\u201d Khullar said.\n\u201cMake sure that you\u2019re reaching out to them to make sure that they\u2019re doing OK, that they understand that there are people still looking out for them that they\u2019re bonded with, that they\u2019re connected with.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-121": {"text": "Suspend all mortgage and rent payments for NHS workers. Now\nA letter to chancellor Rishi Sunak following my conversation with an A&E nurse who is working with suspected Covid-19 patients, without even a proper face mask\nJulia, not her real name, is a close friend, a nurse in her 50s at a hospital in Kent. This is distressing, but it\u2019s what she told me on Thursday morning.\n\u201cI have just completed four 12-hour shifts over five days. There are no hazmat suits for this ward, though we have six Covid-19 contacts in isolation. I have a pair of gloves, a paper face mask with a plastic shield and a plastic apron. It\u2019s a fucking joke.\n\u201cThe policy keeps changing. Now they are telling us we don\u2019t need a hazmat suit for looking after Covid-19, just the apron, mask and gloves. I\u2019m working with a healthcare assistant who is 71 and a nurse who is 72. They should be at home, but they just say \u2018who is going to do it otherwise?\u2019.\n\u201cI was running six patients on the ward who were supposed to be in the Covid-19 pod. We do have a pod, and some do go into isolation, but some don\u2019t. It\u2019s completely ad hoc. The swabs are taking three to five days to come back from Southampton, where we send them. Luckily, my Covid-19 suspects came back negative. We nurses are not being tested.\n\u201cBoth isolation rooms on our ward were blocked for a deep clean yesterday. So the people coming in with suspected Covid-19 are put in the same cohort as other suspects. The problem is, if you haven\u2019t got it, the risk is you will get it from being in the same cohort with someone who does test positive. There are only 12 ventilators in our hospital.\n\u201cThe deep-clean taskforce are heroes. They are on the lowest pay band in the NHS \u2013 band one or two, if they\u2019re lucky. The demand on them has gone up massively. I haven\u2019t had time to get to the shops. When I did get there, there was nothing. Thanks a lot, world, for looking after the people who look after you.\n\u201cMy partner is self-employed and had to shut up shop earlier in the week. Our income has halved. This morning I rang Lloyds Bank to put our mortgage on hold. It said there was an hour wait to get through. After an hour and a half I still couldn\u2019t get to speak to anyone. I drove to a local branch. But they said I just had to ring that number again. They wouldn\u2019t even add a note to my account. I\u2019m just going to stop the direct debit for the mortgage and see what happens.\n\u201cI\u2019m really hacked off that the chancellor has announced \u00a3330bn to support business, without even mentioning healthcare workers. Obviously, we need more hazmats and more ventilators, but you need trained nurses to work them, too. If I die from this, I want compensation for my family. I have two children. I want to see my partner and them looked after.\u201d\nJulia deserves more than this. I hate the constant wartime analogies, but this is an emergency like no other we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes. Normally, I write about personal finance for the average reader \u2013 and, of course, there are lots of sensible things I could advise you to do (there is a good list here). But the health service is our defence, and it\u2019s their health, resources and personal finances we should be utterly focused on.\nBritain has run an economy based around financial services that gifts the people at the top huge rewards for work that is, for the most part, socially useless. Our most socially useful workers are being treated appallingly.\nWhat should we be doing? As chancellor, Rishi Sunak, you should order the immediate suspension of all rent and mortgage payments for NHS workers, with no interest or accruals added later. You should direct what\u2019s left of our manufacturing industry into urgent production of goods for the NHS. You should temporarily double the pay of all NHS workers, and set out how the government will treat the wounded and veterans of this battle. There\u2019s no time to lose.

The scientists calculated that this increase would result in about 2,100 more fatal injuries every year in the US alone.\nPeople tend to go outside more and drink more alcohol on hotter days, while higher temperatures are known to increase rates of violence and suicide. The analysis did show a small reduction in the number of deaths related to falls among elderly people, probably because there is less ice in winter.\nPrevious research on the impact of the climate emergency on health has focused on chronic diseases such as heart failure and infectious diseases including malaria. But deaths from injuries currently make up about 10% of all fatalities around the world and the impact of global heating on this had been little studied until now.\nThe scientists say young people play vital roles in supporting societies and economies and that measures to tackle deaths from injury must be a public health priority.\n\u201cOur results show how much climate change can affect young people,\u201d said Prof Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London. \u201cWe need to respond to this threat with better preparedness in terms of emergency services, social support and health warnings.\u201d\nInjury deaths were expected to increase in all nations as temperatures rose, he said, although local factors would influence the extent of the increase\u00a0\u2013 for example, the standard of road safety or level of gun control. The world is currently on track for a 3-4C temperature rise, suggesting the increase in injury deaths could be even higher.\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, is based on data on recorded deaths from injuries in every county in the mainland US between 1980 to 2017. It also used temperature data to find the months when the average temperature was 2C higher than usual. This enabled the researchers to account for the fact that people adapt to normal local conditions but are affected by unusual temperatures.\nComparing the data allowed the scientists to estimate the annual increase in deaths that would result from a 2C rise. Men are already much more likely than women to die from injuries and the researchers found that 84% of the additional deaths were among men.\nThe most affected age group was 15-34. Road crashes accounted for 42% of the extra deaths and suicide 30%. Deaths from violence and from drowning both made up about 14% of the total. Drownings increase in hot weather as more people swim.\n\u201cThere is a long history of work that shows injuries are fundamentally seasonal,\u201d said Ezzati. \u201cSome of this is obvious \u2013 people drown more in summer. We also know that warmth influences both our physiology and our behaviour.\u201d\nThe reasons deaths from suicide and violent assault increase in hot weather are not fully understood. But the researchers said it was possible that people spending more time outdoors had a higher risk of confrontations.\nPeople also tend to be more agitated in hot weather, and may drink more alcohol, which could lead to more assaults. Previous research indicates that high temperatures are associated with higher levels of mental distress, especially in young people.\nInjuries already kill more that 5 million people a year, more than HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and such deaths are rising. Policies to tackle the climate emergency should include measures to combat deaths from injuries, said Shanthi Ameratunga and Alistair Woodward of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in an accompanying commentary on the research.\n\u201cThe need to address this major public health problem is particularly urgent in low- and middle-income countries that experience over 80% of the global injury burden and are generally more vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThe public health community tend to forget that injury deaths are actually a pretty big factor [in overall mortality],\u201d said Ezzati. \u201cThe emphasis on young people is an important aspect of the story, as they are educationally and economically active.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-123": {"text": "How do you think your shopping habits will change after lockdown?\nWith high streets struggling under lockdown and boycotting fashion becomes more popular as people stay at home, we want to hear how your shopping habits may change once shops reopen.\nHow has your attitude towards shopping changed during lockdown?

The group, formed under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, provided guidance to the government based on the National Climate Assessment, a major compendium of climate science released every four years.\nDocuments released under freedom of information laws subsequently showed the Trump administration was concerned about the ideological makeup of the panel. \u201cIt only has one member from industry, and the process to gain more balance would take a couple of years to accomplish,\u201d wrote George Kelly, then the deputy chief of staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a June 2017 email.\nThe advisory group has since been resurrected, however, following an invitation from New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and has been financially supported by Columbia University and the American Meteorological Society. It now has 20 expert members.\nThe panel is now known as the Science to Climate Action Network (Scan) and has now completed work it would have finished for the federal government, releasing a report on Thursday warning that Americans are being put at risk from the impacts of a warming planet due to a muddled response to climate science.\n\u201cWe were concerned that the federal government is missing an opportunity to get better information into the hands of those who prepare for what we have already unleashed,\u201d said Richard Moss, a member of Scan and a visiting scientist at Columbia University, who previously chaired the federal panel.\n\u201cWe\u2019re only just starting to see the effects of climate change, it\u2019s only going to get much worse. But we haven\u2019t yet rearranged our daily affairs to adapt to science we have,\u201d he added.\nThe fourth National Climate Assessment, released on the day after Thanksgiving last year, detailed how climate change is already harming Americans, with sobering findings on future impacts. At the time, Trump said he didn\u2019t believe the report.\n\u201cThe impacts and costs of climate change are already being felt in the United States, and changes in the likelihood or severity of some recent extreme weather events can now be attributed with increasingly higher confidence to human-caused warming,\u201d the report, the work of 13 US government agencies, states.\nOn current trends, the US economy is set to lose $500bn a year from crop damage, lost labor and extreme weather damages, the report found. Rainfall levels and flooding have increased in much of the country, with the amount of the US west consumed annually by wildfires set to increase as much as sixfold by 2050, according to the assessment.\nBut these warnings have been only intermittently heeded in decisions made by cities and states across the US, due to a lack of knowledge, political will or funding. The US has no national sea level rise plan, for example, and the Trump administration has scrapped rules around building infrastructure in areas deemed vulnerable to climate change. These circumstances have led to haphazard planning that results in certain dwellings repeatedly lost to flooding or fire.\n\u201cWe live in an era of climate change and yet many of our systems, codes and standards have not caught up,\u201d said Daniel Zarrilli, chief climate adviser to New York City, one of the few US cities with such a person. \u201cIntegrating climate science into everyday decisions is not just smart planning, it\u2019s an urgent necessity.\u201d\nIn its new report, the Science to Climate Action Network recommends the creation of a \u201ccivil-society-based climate assessment consortium\u201d that would combine private and public interests to provide more localized help for communities menaced by floods, wildfires or other perils.\n\u201cImagine working in state or county government \u2013 you have a road that is flooding frequently and you get three design options all with different engineering,\u201d Moss said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the capacity to know what is the best option to avoid flooding, you just know what costs more.\n\u201cClimate issues aren\u2019t being raised in communities. They may know they are vulnerable but they don\u2019t know whether to use, for example, wetlands or a flood wall to stop flooding. We need to establish best practices and guide people on how to apply that locally.\n\u201cThis is extremely urgent.

With every contemptuous act or incendiary choice of words, Boris Johnson inflicts further damage on our democracy and makes it harder to see how the divisions of Brexit can ever be healed.\nHe and his party have now sunk to a new low. Care must always be taken in linking words with actions. But the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, police warnings about the rising far-right threat, and the huge increase in online and other abuse, would lead any responsible leader to treat people\u2019s fears with respect. Anti-Brexit lawyer Jolyon Maugham revealed on Thursday that, on police advice, he has installed a panic button and bought a stab vest. Yet Mr Johnson appears intent on sowing further discord, repeatedly referring to the Brexit extension sought by parliament as a \u201csurrender bill\u201d \u2013 a phrase that appears calculated to provoke English nationalists to fury. When MPs urged him to moderate his language, pointing out that such phrases appear in the death threats and abuse they receive, he dismissed their concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d. On Thursday he failed to turn up to answer questions about these exchanges. \nThe difficulties now confronting the UK are enormous, and disagreements about the best way forward are fierce. But to reject Mr Johnson\u2019s demagoguery, as MPs including his former cabinet colleague Justine Greening did on Thursday, is not to place style over substance. It is to recognise that rhetoric can be dangerous, and one of a prime minister\u2019s tasks is to set the tone.\nPoliticians of all parties, commentators and others have their part to play. Prorogation was an outrage, but it was not a coup, and Mr Johnson is not a dictator. In such conflicted times, metaphors such as \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d, \u201cpull the trigger\u201d or \u201cdecapitation\u201d can take on disturbing connotations. At the extreme, abuse and threats, online and in real life, come from the left as well as the Brexit-supporting right.\nGiven the political and constitutional impasse, with the Queen and supreme court drawn into politics in a way that few people would have imagined, it is not hard to see how things could get worse. Mr Johnson\u2019s populist posture, and particularly his embrace of a strongman persona that is toxic to many female parliamentarians, makes comparisons with President Trump inevitable. We don\u2019t yet know how the public views the reversal of the prorogation, but we know how the prime minister is trying to portray it. Thankfully, British broadcasters bear little resemblance to the highly partisan US networks.\nBritain is in the midst of a crisis. The vote for Brexit exposed and deepened social divisions, but also revealed flaws in our institutions. Electoral reformers have long argued for changes that would see us move towards a more consensual and less tribal politics, as well as introducing democracy to the House of Lords. Female politicians in particular have argued that the adversarial, debating-society aspect of the House of Commons is out of date, and contributes to the sense of alienation from Westminster by sections of the public.\nConsideration of such questions lies in the future. For now, the priority must be to stop Mr Johnson from causing more harm. Those Conservative colleagues who have stood by him so far must now speak up against a slide into antagonism that appears as calculated as it is reckless.", "label": 0}, "text-127": {"text": "There is an antidote to demagoguery \u2013 it\u2019s called political rewilding\nYou can blame Jeremy Corbyn for Boris Johnson, and Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump. You can blame the Indian challengers for Narendra Modi, the Brazilian opposition for Jair Bolsonaro, and left and centre parties in Australia, the Philippines, Hungary, Poland and Turkey for similar electoral disasters. Or you could recognise that what we are witnessing is a global phenomenon.\nYes, there were individual failings in all these cases, though the failings were very different: polar opposites in the cases of Corbyn and Clinton. But when the same thing happens in many nations, it\u2019s time to recognise the pattern, and see that heaping blame on particular people and parties fixes nothing.\nIn these nations, people you wouldn\u2019t trust to post a letter for you have been elected to the highest office. There, as widely predicted, they behave like a gang of vandals given the keys to an art gallery, \u201cimproving\u201d the great works in their care with spray cans, box cutters and lump hammers.

They wage war on the institutions that are supposed to restrain their powers while, in some cases, committing extravagant and deliberate outrages against the rule of law. They use impunity as a political weapon, revelling in their ability to survive daily scandals, any one of which would destroy a normal politician.\nIn 2014, Finland started a programme to counter fake news. The result is that Finns have been ranked the people most resistant to post-truth\nSomething has changed: not just in the UK and the US, but in many parts of the world. A new politics, funded by oligarchs, built on sophisticated cheating and provocative lies, using dark ads and conspiracy theories on social media, has perfected the art of persuading the poor to vote for the interests of the very rich. We must understand what we are facing, and the new strategies required to resist it.\nIf there is a formula for the new demagoguery, there must also be a formula for confronting and overturning it. I don\u2019t yet have a complete answer, but I believe there are some strands we can draw together.\nIn Finland, on the day of our general election, Boris Johnson\u2019s antithesis became prime minister: the 34-year-old Sanna Marin, who is strong, humble and collaborative. Finland\u2019s politics, emerging from its peculiar history, cannot be replicated here. But there is one crucial lesson. In 2014, the country started a programme to counter fake news, teaching people how to recognise and confront it. The result is that Finns have been ranked, in a recent study of 35 nations, the people most resistant to post-truth politics.\nDon\u2019t expect Johnson\u2019s government, or Trump\u2019s, to inoculate people against their own lies. But this need not be a government initiative. This week, the US Democrats published a guide to confronting online disinformation. They will seek to hold Google, Facebook and Twitter to account. I would like to see progressive parties everywhere form a global coalition promoting digital literacy, and pressuring social media platforms to stop promoting falsehoods.\nBut this is the less important task. The much bigger change is this: to stop seeking to control people from the centre. At the moment, the political model for almost all parties is to drive change from the top down. They write a manifesto, that they hope to turn into government policy, which may then be subject to a narrow and feeble consultation, which then leads to legislation, which then leads to change. I believe the best antidote to demagoguery is the opposite process: radical trust. To the greatest extent possible, parties and governments should trust communities to identify their own needs and make their own decisions.\nOver the past few years, our relationship with nature has begun to be transformed by a new approach: rewilding. Bizarre as this might sound, I believe this thinking could help inform a new model of politics. It is time for political rewilding.\nWhen you try to control nature from the top down, you find yourself in a constant battle with it. Conservation groups in this country often seek to treat complex living systems as if they were simple ones. Through intensive management \u2013 cutting, grazing and burning \u2013 they strive to beat nature into submission until it meets their idea of how it should behave. But ecologies, like all complex systems, are highly dynamic and adaptive, evolving (when allowed) in emergent and unpredictable ways.\nEventually, and inevitably, these attempts at control fail. Nature reserves managed this way tend to lose abundance and diversity, and require ever more extreme intervention to meet the irrational demands of their stewards. They also become vulnerable. In all systems, complexity tends to be resilient, while simplicity tends to be fragile. Keeping nature in a state of arrested development in which most of its natural processes and its keystone species (the animals that drive these processes) are missing makes it highly susceptible to climate breakdown and invasive species. But rewilding \u2013 allowing dynamic, spontaneous organisation to reassert itself \u2013 can result in a sudden flourishing, often in completely unexpected ways, with a great improvement in resilience.\nThe same applies to politics. Mainstream politics, controlled by party machines, has sought to reduce the phenomenal complexity of human society into a simple, linear model that can be controlled from the centre. The political and economic systems it creates are simultaneously highly unstable and lacking in dynamism; susceptible to collapse, as many northern towns can testify, while unable to regenerate themselves. They become vulnerable to the toxic, invasive forces of ethno-nationalism and supremacism.\nBut in some parts of the world, towns and cities have begun to rewild politics. Councils have catalysed mass participation, then \u2013 to the greatest extent possible \u2013 stepped back and allowed it to evolve. Classic examples include participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre in Brazil, the Decide Madrid system in Spain, and the Better Reykjavik programme in Iceland. Local people have reoccupied the political space that had been captured by party machines and top-down government. They have worked out together what their communities need and how to make it happen, refusing to let politicians frame the questions or determine the answers. The results have been extraordinary: a massive re-engagement in politics, particularly among marginalised groups, and dramatic improvements in local life. Participatory politics does not require the blessing of central government, just a confident and far-sighted local authority.\nIs this a formula for a particular party to regain power? No. It\u2019s much bigger than that. It\u2019s a formula for taking back control, making our communities more resilient and the machinations of any government in Westminster less relevant. This radical devolution is the best defence against capture by any political force. Let\u2019s change the nature of politics in this country.

The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for McKenzie\u2019s conduct, and accused Scott Morrison of being \u201cup to his neck in it\u201d because he refused to sack her.\nBefore the latest revelation, McKenzie\u2019s position had been backed by Morrison, the Liberal deputy leader, Josh Frydenberg, and Nationals colleague David Littleproud.\nPorter said he \u201cdid not know the individual circumstances\u201d but noted it is \u201cnot unusual for a local member to be a member or patron of a club that might get a grant\u201d.\n\u201cIn this case of course the local member was also a minister \u2013 as to the procedures of that particular grant I don\u2019t have the information to comment.\n\u201cThe situations are different depending on your level of involvement \u2013 being a mere patron or a paper member of a club is different from having a very active role in a club.\u201d\nPorter said it was \u201cfair\u201d of the auditor general to advise better conflict of interest policies, but noted that recommendation was directed at Sport Australia.\nPorter acknowledged that McKenzie had \u201cbrought in considerations that were different\u201d to Sport Australia, but argued ministers can exercise \u201cexecutive authority\u201d to depart from recommendations and take a \u201cslightly different\u201d view in selecting from eligible projects.\nThe auditor general\u2019s report found that 70% of projects approved by McKenzie in the second round in March 2019 were not recommended by Sport Australia, rising to 73% in the third round in April 2019.\nPorter then argued the sports grants did not constitute \u201crorts\u201d or \u201cpork barrelling\u201d because they did not favour one side of politics over the other, with more Labor seats awarded grants than if McKenzie had not intervened.\n\u201cHaving ministerial authority and oversight on those things is completely fair and reasonable \u2013 and all of these projects were deemed to be eligible.\u201d\nPorter said there was a \u201cclear distinction\u201d between McKenzie deciding her own ranking of projects and a minister awarding a grant to an ineligible project, as he said occurred in the Ros Kelly affair, without proper record keeping.\nPorter said he did not believe there was \u201csomething here that requires some further level of attention in terms of probity \u2026 based on what I\u2019ve seen\u201d.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Liberal MP Tim Wilson told Sky News it was \u201cultimately a decision for the National party about who is deputy leader\u201d but said it was up to McKenzie how to allocate funding between eligible projects.\nABC News Breakfast revealed that Somers Yacht Club received $172,606 and its treasurer Tim Brock had thanked the health minister Greg Hunt\u2019s office for \u201cwork behind the scenes\u201d to help win the grant.\n\u201cWhat we do is \u2013 like all MPs \u2013 and what all MPs should be doing is fighting for and advocating for projects within their electorate,\u201d Hunt said.\nHunt said MPs should support worthy projects by writing letters of support and \u201cmaking the case for them\u201d.\nA Facebook video shows a yacht club treasurer in @GregHuntMP's electorate thanking him for the \u201cwork behind the scenes\u201d securing just over $170,000 from the controversial sport grants program.@paulwkennedy asks the Minister what that meant. pic.twitter.com/JY4drNgV8y\nMcKenzie is likely to face renewed scrutiny when parliament resumes in February, with minor parties the Greens, Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation and Centre Alliance offering to support a Senate inquiry into the program.", "label": 0}, "text-129": {"text": "Backups like Snowy 2.0 Would Work Better with Conventional Power Plants not Wind/Solar\nWe have about a dozen pumped-hydro plants in the US. In some places (that\u2019s why they\u2019re not abundant) it is economically feasible to store energy by pumping water uphill to a higher reservoir, and then release it when demand is high.\nHydro has the advantage of being a system that can turn on or off in a hurry. Typically, a dam has a lot of independent water turbines. So you can turn on (say) 50 MW, 100 MW, and so on.\nGreenies look at storage systems as their salvation. (Indeed, solar and wind are nearly worthless without back-up.) What they fail to realize is that back-up is far better used with conventional power.\nIf a back-up system (of whatever type you care to mention) is used with wind or solar, it has to have enough storage to last for days \u2014 possibly even weeks \u2014 to keep the grid from going down.\nNow look what happens in you increase conventional baseload power (the cheapest, most reliable) beyond the actual baseload demand. During times of low demand, you store the excess energy, and then release it during times of high demand. The upshot is that you need to store only something like 20% of one day\u2019s energy rather than 100% energy for many days.

A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, who also refused to take part.\nThe Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson\u2019s place, accusing them of \u201cconspiring\u201d with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case.\nGove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence.\nThe opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate.\nJohnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d.\nThe leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives\u2019 pledge for net zero by 2050.\nThe expansion of Heathrow airport \u2013 passed by MPs last year \u2013 and the HS2 rail link were all discussed.\nSi\u00e2n Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted.\n\u201cThe question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry.\nChallenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d\n\u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon.\nThe Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper.\n\u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said.\nMore than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets.\nCorbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d\nHundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who was present at the studio \u2013 said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he \u201cwould have made a big, big contribution\u201d.\nHe insisted that Gove\u2019s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: \u201cGove on!\u201d\nOn leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson\u2019s failure to attend and the Tories\u2019 green policies.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today.\u201d\nHe told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said.Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d\nThe scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in \u201ca state of planetary emergency\u201d.\nTo meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as \u00a320bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \nSturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. \n\u201cIf we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,\u201d Sturgeon said.\nSwinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. \u201cBrexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,\u201d she said.\nPrice said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: \u201cWe have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.\u201d\n", "label": 0}, "text-131": {"text": "Duncan Hamilton wins William Hill Sports Book of the Year for third time\nDuncan Hamilton has won the 31st William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, becoming the only author in its history to have won three times.

And for the first march, planned for Thursday in The Hague, organisers say they hope for a rather modest turnout of about 3,000.\n\u201cThe commitment of Belgian youth seems to be greater than that of Dutch young people,\u201d said the Dutch newspaper Trouw on Friday. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nCertainly the attitude of the Dutch government has not been particularly welcoming of the truancy movement.

Truly, you were one of the finest. Lord\u2019s 2019 is already shorthand for the greatest one-day cricket match in history. Wimbledon served up its longest and most dramatic men\u2019s final ever and introduced tennis\u2019s most dazzling talent in more than a decade, Coco Gauff, to the world. Meanwhile the Women\u2019s World Cup shattered viewing records and rust\u2011encrusted prejudices, while the Ashes embedded itself deeper into the public\u2019s consciousness than at any time since 2005.\nYet that was barely half of it. Will we ever forget Megan Rapinoe repeatedly sticking it to Donald Trump or the USA women\u2019s football team winning the World Cup while engaging in confrontation with their own federation in a bid to be paid as much as their less successful male counterparts? Or, come to think of it, Kane Williamson\u2019s remarkable sportsmanship after the cricketing gods had conspired against New Zealand when a throw to the wicketkeeper on the third last delivery of the Cricket World Cup clunked off Ben Stokes\u2019s bat and ran away to the boundary, turning a likely victory into eventual defeat?\nAnd then, as a forerunner to the glorious summer, there was Tiger Woods, who somehow defied the multiple spinal surgeries, serious knee issues and the passage of time to win his first major in 11 years on a delirious Sunday at Augusta. Many reckoned it was the greatest comeback in history \u2013 although it is difficult to dismiss Niki Lauda\u2019s fourth place finish at Monza in 1976 six weeks after half his face was scorched when his Ferrari burst into flames.\nThere was something else, too. In an age of weariness and wilfulness, mistrust in our politicians and political processes, of exhausting fractiousness and fake news, sport repeatedly provided sweet relief.\nThere are antecedents for this, most notably in 1934 when, as Robert Winder\u2019s fine book, Half-Time, points out, \u201cthe simplicities of sport\u201d became very appealing in a year when 50,000 marchers converged in Hyde Park to protest against poverty and unemployment, Hitler was murdering critics of the Nazi regime and \u201cthe dreadful silhouettes of new demons were darkening the public discourse as tangled ideas about war, peace, social progress and imperial decline quarrelled in the mist\u201d.\nIt was against this backdrop that Fred Perry became Wimbledon\u2019s first English men\u2019s champion for 25 years, Hedley Verity bowled England to victory against Australia at Lord\u2019s with figures of 15 wickets for 104 and Henry Cotton, having been recommended a diet of minced steak, carrots and red wine while convalescing from stomach ulcers in Biarritz, found his health and golf game in better shape than for years as he won his first Open.\nSuch was Britain\u2019s sporting success in 1934, incidentally, that the New York Times even ran a piece, \u201cBully for John Bull\u201d claiming: \u201cIt\u2019s about time they declared a Bank Holiday over there, to celebrate the comeback of Great Britain in sports!\u201d However Winston Churchill was less blinded to the realities elsewhere, writing a week after Perry\u2019s victory: \u201cI look with wonder upon the thoughtless crowds disporting themselves in the summer sunshine. All the while, across the North Sea, a terrible process is astir. Germany is arming.\u201d\nThere have been great British sporting summers since then, most notably in 2012 when an unprecedented harvest of Olympic medals was matched by a glut of think-pieces hailing how open-facing these isles had become. True, in London that summer everyone seemed to carry a permanent smile on their face, as if serotonin has been pumped into the water supply. But, with Britain in a permanent state of cultural civil war, those days now seem like a mirage.\nSeven years on it is also harder to trust what we saw given that 132 athletes who competed at London 2012 have now been disqualified for performance-enhancing drugs \u2013 while Richard McLaren, the Canadian lawyer who investigated Russia doping, has suggested that those Games were \u201ccorrupted on an unprecedented scale\u201d. Meanwhile Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Mo Farah, two of the British stars of the Olympics, no longer carry quite the same sheen, either given Wiggins has faced questions over therapeutic use exemptions and mystery packages while Farah\u2019s former coach, Alberto Salazar, remains under investigation by the US Anti\u2011Doping Agency \u2013 although both men deny any wrongdoing.\nAt least in 2019 we know we have flawed heroes for these flawed times. Anyone who has read Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian\u2019s brilliant biography of Tiger Woods knows that for years off the course he was the living embodiment of Philip Larkin\u2019s This be the Verse. His father really did fuck him up, at least emotionally. And while Steve Smith has batted with a sustained brilliance rarely seen since the days of Bradman and Brilliantine, he has been repeatedly reminded of his past misdemeanours every time he steps to the crease. Stokes, who will rightly win the 2019 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, has also faced turmoil of his own.\nThis year we were also fortunate enough to continue to witness three of the all-time greats \u2013 Woods, Roger Federer and Serena Williams \u2013 still rage against the dying of the light while others, such as Jofra Archer and Rose Lavelle, sparked into flame.

The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms and went into self-isolation. \nBut while Johnson said he would be able to continue to run the government\u2019s response to the crisis alone in his Downing Street flat, public health experts rounded on his attitude to the infection and accused him of being \u201cnonchalant\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d to behave appropriately.\nThe prime minister has previously been accused of failing to keep an appropriate distance from other senior figures in public, and has continued with parliamentary duties this week, raising the possibility that he may have infected others in the cabinet and beyond.\nOn another day of rapid growth in the number of deaths caused by the virus, Johnson issued a video message revealing that he had developed \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. But he added: \u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was subsequently spotted running out of No 10 and along Downing Street, apparently hoping not to be noticed.\nNot long afterwards, Hancock issued his own statement saying he too had tested positive, and would be working from home. And later in the day, Prof Whitty, who had advised the prime minister to get tested, said he too was displaying symptoms.\nThe three men leading the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic \u2013 Johnson, Hancock and Whitty \u2013 must now do so from quarantine, as cases continue to surge.\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is the designated stand-in for Johnson if the prime minister proves unable to continue with his duties, but that contingency plan has not yet been activated.\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove announced at Friday\u2019s Downing Street press conference that another 181 people had now died from the virus, taking the total across the UK to 759.\nExperts questioned whether Johnson had been shielded from the virus effectively enough, and asked why ministers and other colleagues who have worked closely with him in recent days were not being tested.\nThe deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said detailed contact-tracing was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d at this stage of the outbreak, but that the men would have been tested because of their importance to the government\u2019s response to the crisis.\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cNo 10 is considered a workplace. The advice to staff here and the prime minister\u2019s colleagues is that they don\u2019t need to do anything in terms of self-isolation unless they start to suspect that they have symptoms, in which case they should follow the Public Health England advice.\u201d\nDespite urging the nation in a solemn broadcast on Monday evening to \u201cstay at home\u201d where possible, Johnson continued to carry out his parliamentary duties, including prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 though the Downing Street press briefings have been carried out by video link since Monday.\nProf Susan Michie, director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London, said: \u201cThose in leadership positions should practise what they preach. If leaders do not adhere to their own recommendations, this undermines trust in them, which in turn can undermine the population\u2019s adherence to their advice. The advice was to go to work only if essential or if you could not work from home and could guarantee your own and others\u2019 safety by keeping at least two metres apart.\n\u201cGiven the transmission routes, of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the prime minister and health secretary have tested positive.\u201d\nDr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, said: \u201cThe government has been too slow to act on this, and they\u2019ve been slow as individuals. I was surprised to see prime minister questions going ahead this week \u2013 it was clearly unnecessary.\n\u201cIt reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner, and raises questions about the ability of people in power, including the prime minister, to discipline themselves. They should all have been more careful.\u201d \nProf Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cLeaders need to lead by example. It wasn\u2019t a good thing that he was telling people that he was going around shaking hands and being quite nonchalant about the virus.\u201d \nJohnson received the result of his test at midnight, hours after he was seen outside the door of No 10 clapping in support of NHS workers alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\nBoth Johnson and Hancock have been in repeated contact with other senior political figures, including cabinet members and advisers, in the last few days. But no other ministers would be tested for the virus unless they showed symptoms, Downing Street said.\nIt is unknown how Johnson contracted the illness, but officials confirmed that other people who worked in No 10 were self-isolating after showing symptoms. \nJohnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cFrom the moment he had symptoms, he took steps to ensure that he wasn\u2019t in close contact with anyone.\n\u201cHe did really want to take part in clapping NHS staff.

However, many of them will occur immediately before or after the infant\u2019s check, to make the best use of mothers\u2019 and NHS staff\u2019s time.\nUntil now many women have either not had a postnatal check or had only a very brief one during their baby\u2019s appointment, often because of time pressures. That has left many feeling unable to raise issues about their own health and led to concerns that some conditions are being missed.\nThe change has been widely welcomed. It is expected to lead to better identification of mental health problems that can arise from pregnancy and birth such as postnatal depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and quicker treatment for those who need it.\nNHS England has agreed to pay the \u00a312m cost of the initiative as part of a new five-year contract with GP leaders in England, under which they will expand the services they offer. Women are expected to have at least 10 minutes with the GP or nurse carrying out the check.\n\u201cThis additional funding for the six-week postnatal check will enable GPs to ensure that the mother receives a proper maternal check, as well as the baby, which is so crucial.

It would be wrong to regard such warnings as a bluff. When push comes to shove, such MPs are likely to be in no mood for compromise. This attitude will have been hardened if Boris Johnson becomes party leader despite his obvious flaws \u2013 especially since Brexit has radicalised Conservative members so much that they would rather break up the United Kingdom than not leave the EU. Depressingly the no-deal option is openly flirted with by both leadership candidates, shamelessly proffered to Tory members in exchange for their votes.\nIt is important to remember that even with the DUP\u2019s support, a few Tory rebels can bring down a wayward government by leaving it. What also seems clear is that the new Conservative leader will not have a majority for either his central policy or for his government. That means Theresa May will in all probability have to assess which party leader will command a majority in the Commons. If it is not the Tory leader then it will be Jeremy Corbyn. If neither can put together the votes then Britain will be heading for a general election. Where Tory rebels would go from there is a tantalising question. Some have argued that the shape of the civil war in the party resembles the infighting that was a prelude to Robert Peel\u2019s 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, which protected British grain against cheaper imports. Peelites such as William Gladstone, who split the Tories by defecting to what ended up as the Liberal party, could justifiably claim to be on the side of the future rather than the past. That is still a seductive argument that could be used by their would-be heirs today.\nHowever, the recent experience of Change UK has shown that while there are many contenders for the inheritor of Gladstone\u2019s mantle, their claims have yet to be realised in substance. Well-established mainstream parties are not given to significant splits in the modern era \u2013 not least because no substantial breakaway has given rise to a significant new competitor or one that could ally with an existing rival. Both Labour, which endured a traumatic schism in the 1980s, and the Tories are being stretched by Brexit. For the Conservatives there is a more existential threat because it faces a surgent rightwing nationalist Brexit party of Nigel Farage.\nThe battle for the soul of the party, between rationalists and ideologues, could quickly become one that splits the Tories so badly that they end up out of power for decades. Even if the party stays together there is another existential threat: the electoral system. Having benefited from first past the post for decades, the Tories could become its victim. The reason is that under current arrangements once a party falls below a certain level of support, which is about 25%, the number of seats it wins collapses. With Mr Farage and Brexit rumbling on, the country could very well have four parties that can muster that share of the vote. Both Labour and the Tories risk voters defecting to the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats. The result of any election could be chaos. It should be noted that British democracy has never been specifically associated with just one way of voting. First past the post in single-member constituencies was not the original system, nor one that many reformers had sought. It was a postwar creation that ought to be reconsidered in the light of the debacle of Brexit.

Exxon has previously attempted to block an investigation into its practices, claiming its first amendment rights were being violated.\nUnderwood said: \u201cInvestors put their money and their trust in Exxon \u2013 which assured them of the long-term value of their shares, as the company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions. Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.\n\u201cInstead, Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations.\u201d\nNew York\u2019s lawsuit paints a picture of corporate malfeasance whereby Exxon told investors it was applying a \u201cproxy cost\u201d to its extraction of fossil fuels to account for the risk of governmental action to address climate change. In practice, the lawsuit alleges, Exxon applied much lower proxy costs than it initially stated, essentially assuming that existing climate regulations would remain in place, unchanged.\nThis led to inaccurate information about investments in major projects, such as Exxon\u2019s oil sands operations in Alberta, Canada, the lawsuit states. Canada has recently outlined a national plan to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution in a bid to reduce emissions.\nExxon\u2019s role in covering up the impact of climate change has come to light in the recent years, with the company aware for decades about the consequences of burning fossil fuels only to downplay this in public.\nThe company now says it accepts climate change is real and a threat, even pledging $1m toward a campaign to put a price on carbon.\nThis support comes with the caveat that mounting lawsuits aimed at making Exxon pay for damage wrought by climate change are dismissed. In July, a federal judge kicked out a lawsuit lodged by New York City that took aim at the five major oil producers, including Exxon.\nThe New York state lawsuit does not concern the impact of climate change, but rather Exxon\u2019s role in communicating the risk of climate regulation to investors.\n\u201cBig oil may finally face some consequences for its role in wrecking the climate,\u201d said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate campaign group 350.org. \u201cThe New York attorney general is standing up for investors who may have been swindled, and indirectly for the seven billion of us who will suffer from Exxon\u2019s lies.\u201d\nExxon was contacted for comment.\nAttorneys general in California and Illinois, asked if they would join the New York suit, said they planned to take a \u201cclose look\u201d at the securities fraud law the state is suing under.\nThe case, \u201chas been a topic of mutual conversation among various state AGs, and we are all going to take a close look at the filing,\u201d California attorney general Xavier Becerra said.\nCalifornia would need to consider how its own laws apply, Becerra said. In Illinois, the power to join this type of case lies with the secretary of state, attorney general Lisa Madigan explained.\nShe said: \u201cThe overall message here is that Exxon and others that were really at the forefront of causing climate change conditions in our country and around the world long knew that this was taking place and withheld that information to the detriment of not just their investors but ultimately all of us around the country.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-139": {"text": "'There is now a real movement for change': what first-time voters think\nWhile polls have indicated that the majority of young voters will support Labour in the general election, voting intentions among 18- to 25-year-olds vary as much as they do among older voters depending on the area.\nIn the Lancastrian seaside town of Morecambe, the Conservatives had a majority of just 1,399 votes in 2017 but Labour hasn\u2019t entirely convinced the sixth formers of Morecambe Bay academy.\nEthan Furlong, 18, said he was voting Conservative because Labour is \u201call about free everything\u201d.

That then affects me,\u201d she said.\nHannah Yates, a passionate Labour voter in High Peak, said her dad also earned enough to be taxed more: \u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t mind being taxed that little more if it can go to the NHS or universities \u2013 it\u2019s not like it\u2019s being taken and thrown to the wind \u2026 For the working-class people who have to work three jobs to make ends meet, they need all the help they can get.\u201d\nTaylor Marsden said Corbyn was \u201cthe first politician I can actually believe in.

Yes, probably - and disappointed that taxpayer money was spent in this way.\n\u201cThe class action \u2013 if it comes to that \u2013 I believe is a worthy thing. Governments should not be able to act in this reprehensible manner.\u201d\nSlater and Gordon practice group leader, Andrew Baker, noted that one of the \u201cmain advantages\u201d of a class action is that any claim \u201cwill automatically cover all groups that fall within the class\u201d.\nHe said this was an \u201cimportant feature\u201d given clubs \u201care probably going to be reluctant\u201d to bring individual claims because they will need to apply for grant funding in future.\nIn its scathing report, the ANAO said: \u201cA significant shortcoming was that, while the program guidelines identified that the minister for sport would approve [community sport infrastructure grant] funding, there are no records evidencing that the minister was advised of the legal basis on which the minister could undertake an approval role, and it is not evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was.\u201d\nIt noted that although the sports minister has a power to direct Sports Australia \u201cit was not used\u201d.\nThe attorney general, Christian Porter, told Guardian Australia the government had noted the comments concerning the legal basis for ministerial involvement and \u201cgiven the lack of any conclusive view offered by the auditor general, the prime minister has sought further consideration of the issue, which I am attending to\u201d.\nMcKenzie and the prime minister Scott Morrison insist that all projects granted funding were eligible and no rules were broken in the administration of the scheme.\nOn Monday the sports grants scandal drew in Morrison after revelations that he had personally handed out grants in his electorate of Cook, including a $200,000 grant to the Lilli Pilli Football Club.\nThe ABC reported that Lilli Pilli Football Club had started works in October 2018, despite Sports Australia guidelines stipulating that projects that have already commenced works are not eligible for funding.\nA spokesman for Sports Australia told Guardian Australia the club has \u201cbeen making progressive upgrades to [its] facilities\u201d and its grant application, submitted in September 2018, related to the second stage of projects.\n\u201cThe club\u2019s second stage projects included the fit-out of gender-neutral change-rooms and a community room,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSport Australia notified the club of their successful grant application in December 2018, with work commencing on their second stage projects in January 2019.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-143": {"text": "'Team Oil': ex-oil worker seeks to educate legislators on climate change\nBill Bray makes sure to wear his ExxonMobil baseball cap to the farmers\u2019 markets and Rotary clubs he visits in Texas to talk about climate change.\nA retired oil industry engineer and manager, Bray is now a volunteer with the Citizens Climate Lobby. The grassroots group wants Congress to pass legislation to limit the greenhouse gas pollution that\u2019s heating up the planet. And when Bray introduces himself to a staffer or lawmaker in Washington DC, his career is the first thing he brings up.\nIn the 1990s, while still in the industry, he sent a letter to then president George HW Bush calling for higher energy prices, which would slow consumption, he told them.\n\u201cPeople thought I was totally off the reservation,\u201d Bray joked during a team lunch with other former oil workers during a trip to the US capital this week.\nNow ExxonMobil is one of a number of major oil companies backing a tax on carbon pollution, he notes.\nCitizens Climate Lobby aims to meet with every legislator twice a year and check back with them in between.\nMany of its members are progressive and are now hoping to see more buy-in from newly elected Democrats as the party took the majority in the House in the midterm elections earlier this month. But Bray displays a Conservative Caucus ribbon on his nametag at meetings.\nAt training sessions for hundreds this week, volunteers from around the country learned how to talk to policymakers and people in their communities even if they don\u2019t have similar political beliefs or backgrounds.\nIn one hotel conference hall, newcomers were taught to discuss specific impacts, including changing landscapes, extreme weather and lost crops.\nLarry Peranich, a volunteer from San Diego and another member of the Conservative Caucus, told the room how his house was damaged in a wildfire in 2003.\n\u201cThe problem is lately bigger and bigger. I have a knot in my stomach, I know what people are going through,\u201d Peranich said, referring to the killer fires that are decimating California communities.\nAfter those stories, Citizens Climate Lobby members are supposed to pivot to optimism and proposed solutions.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to dangle people off that cliff without giving them hope,\u201d said Brett Cease, volunteer education and engagement coordinator.\nIn another meeting room, volunteers discussed \u201cwhat works with Republicans\u201d. Peter Thomas, from San Diego, practiced his pitch for taxing carbon and returning it to people \u201con an equitable basis\u201d, language that might resonate with Democrats or Republicans.\nSession leaders explained how to use storytelling to connect on a personal level. They played a humorous video of author Kurt Vonnegut describing narrative arcs that appeal to people.\nThe next day, volunteers put their training into practice at offices on Capitol Hill.\nBray, who was matched with Republican offices, had mixed results. One staffer had a firm grasp of the climate change problem but said the office couldn\u2019t support any pricing mechanism because it would interfere with free markets. A second lawmaker who was retiring and denies the science that shows climate change is manmade agreed to the meeting and engaged in a long discussion but declined to give the volunteers advice about how to move forward.\nBut, \u201cfundamental to Citizens Climate Lobby is we want to talk with everyone\u201d, Bray said.\nHis \u201cTeam Oil\u201d sometimes shares information with lawmakers about how the fossil fuel industry thinks about climate change. They have a number of liaisons to specific companies. On meetings via phone they also collaborate on white papers that delve into the technical and engineering questions involved in limiting greenhouse gas pollution.\nCitizens Climate Lobby has outlined a specific proposal that members pitch. The group wants the government to institute a carbon fee and dividend program, to tax pollution and return the money collected from industry to consumers to offset costs. Other advocates \u2013 from liberal, conservative and non-partisan organizations \u2013 are offering similar plans, but most Republicans oppose climate legislation and Democratic leaders also don\u2019t have a strategy in place for a comprehensive solution.\nRegardless of their views, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are more likely to meet with their own constituents on climate change than with Washington-based advocates.\nWill Koren, who founded the New Orleans chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby, had meetings with staffers for five of the six members of the Louisiana delegation.\nClimate change is particularly thorny in Louisiana, which is sinking and also facing sea-level rise, tougher hurricanes and worse flooding because of rising temperatures, but is also reliant on the oil industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for anybody to come forward,\u201d Koren said. Some of the lawmakers reject manmade climate change but others agree it\u2019s a concern and \u201cget stuck in the politics\u201d, he said.\nKoren, who works as a sales consultant in the restaurant industry in New Orleans, started the chapter there after his sister\u2019s home flooded in a freak rain event in Baton Rouge in 2016.\n\u201cThere is no stopping what\u2019s happening. If I didn\u2019t have this outlet, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be functional,\u201d Koren said. \u201cI know I\u2019ll be gutting more houses. I know all my friends might have to move. But what else do you do?\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-144": {"text": "I'm into health food and hot yoga. I'm also addicted to vaping\nI like to think of myself as a healthy, calm lady-boss who aims to inspire others. My morning routine consists of transcendental meditation, light therapy and boxing before 8am. When I\u2019m not in front of my computer or traveling for a public speaking gig, I\u2019m usually in a hot yoga class. And so it may surprise my clients, family, and friends that I am one of the 50 million people around the globe addicted to e-cigarette juice.\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard the phrase \u201cJuuling\u201d, you probably picture a teenager who rips a Juul that\u2019s hidden in the sleeve of their hoodie, holding in the hit so as not to get caught vaping in math class, not a middle-class woman in her early 30s who gets HydraFacials and sips turmeric tea.\nThe juice, better known as e-liquid, in a vape or e-cigarette usually contains nicotine and other ingredients like propylene glycol, and vegetable glycerin, which is heated to create an inhalable aerosol. Juul is the most popular vaping product. Using influencer marketing and with celebrity endorsements like Dave Chappelle hitting his Juul during his 2017 Netflix special, Sophie Turner proclaiming having her Juul taken away was the secret to acting, and an Instagrammable photo of Katy Perry sporting her Juul at the Golden Globes, the company went from selling an unknown product to owning the category and from $200m in sales in 2017 to $1.3bn the following year. According to a Jama study, more than one in four students (28% of high schoolers) vape nicotine. Dr Karen Wilson of the American Academy of Pediatrics said that she sees \u201ckids that are using four pods\u201d \u2013the nicotine equivalent of four packs of cigarettes \u2013 a day. Adults who vape often use it as a smoking cessation tool. And some adults have entered vape culture, mixing and selling custom flavors and labeling themselves as do-it-yourselfers, cloud chasers, sub-ohmers, coil builders or modders. When it comes to culture I appreciate, I\u2019m more of a literature or health food aficionado. I\u2019ve never discussed my mod or coil on Reddit, nor do I know how to blow a vape cloud in the shape of a jellyfish.\nLike many, I was surprised when the number of people with a severe lung illness linked to vaping had reached over 2,600 cases and nearly 60 deaths\nYet, like the teenager we envision being naively pressured into the habit, three years ago I adopted the common belief that e-cigarettes are less harmful than other forms of tobacco. Like many, I was surprised when the number of people with a severe lung illness linked to vaping had reached over 2,600 cases and nearly 60 deaths. Recently, we\u2019ve learned that the key culprit behind those illnesses is probably black market THC vapes using specific additives including a form of vitamin E. Even so, the FDA and Trump administration are pushing for a national ban on most e-cigarette flavors and San Francisco became the first major US city to ban sales altogether. Students in Texas can face felony charges and expulsions from school for having a vape in their backpacks. It\u2019s an effort to keep the product out of the hands of teens, but the move will affect adults, too \u2013 free-thinking adults who vape for a variety of reasons such as to quit smoking or for the subculture \u2013 people like myself.\nI was first introduced to vaping as a tool to quit smoking three years ago when I visited my family in Michigan. In my parents\u2019 living room playing with my niece and nephew, my brother puffed clouds of white smoke from a device that looked like a walkie-talkie with a short antenna. My stepdad shook his head with every drag. My brother held the cloud in his mouth and said: \u201cIt\u2019s just vape.\u201d\nTechnically, I had given up my half-pack a day habit and quit smoking years before, but the urge was still there. One beer and I\u2019d hide out in the garage with my mom bumming her Marlboro Lights in Michigan or find myself standing in the smokers\u2019 circle outside my favorite East Village bar. Smoking was a form of social currency around other people. Alone, it offered an escape, a ceremony that felt secret and sacred.\nVaping had the same benefits but felt better than smoking because I could conceal my device in a pencil case like the colorful pens I carry around. It didn\u2019t leave a lingering odor that others could detect. No one gives you side-eye or a judgmental cough if they can\u2019t see or smell it. Home in Brooklyn, I noticed vaping was everywhere. Soon, a friendly guy behind a cloud of strawberry vanilla at the local smoke shop set me up with my own device.\nThe danger of vaping is that it\u2019s hidden in plain sight. Smoking is banned in nearly all public spaces, but we haven\u2019t figured out how to stop people from vaping. You can do it nearly anywhere without being noticed, and the amount of nicotine being consumed is also hidden, clicked into a sleek, Stanford University-born device. Juuls don\u2019t create a large cloud and can easily be hidden in your hand. Airports, the movies, classrooms, places where we would never think to light up a cigarette are spaces where you can take a hit without causing a scene.\nInitially, it seemed innocuous, and yet, from the beginning, it negatively affected my lifestyle. Instead of the co-working spaces and coffee shops I patronized, I soon opted to work from home so I could enjoy mid-meeting puffs of mango delight. Once, I excused myself to the bathroom during a quarterly in-person meeting with my most loyal client. In the stall, I took a small toke and held it securely in my mouth until I was certain it disappeared. My relaxing moment turned to burning fear as the fire alarm sounded throughout the building. I thought about flushing my device; instead, I ran outside to meet my colleagues with a red face. I spent the night Googling whether I had caused the alarm to sound. Although it was a routine drill, after that incident, bargaining with myself to work from home became part of my morning routine.\nWe need to share tangible ways for people to quit \u2013 and that information should be as easy to find as the steps to fix a leaking pod\nIn April, when I started boxing, my hunch that vaping was hurting my body was solidified. As soon as I got good enough to throw a strong jab, the congestion in my lungs hit like a body shot and moved its way up my torso until my ears were plugged. It was time for me to quit.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that experts say withdrawal from vaping can be more challenging than quitting conventional cigarettes. The first time I tried to break my own two-pod-a-day addiction, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t buy another pack. I changed my walking route so I wouldn\u2019t pass my local smoke shop every night. But by mid-morning of day one, I searched pockets of pants in my dirty laundry and old purses for pods with enough juice to get me through the day. I ended up watching a YouTube video where a shirtless high schooler with a seashell necklace told me that putting a leaking pod into the freezer for three minutes would reactivate it. \u201cNinety-nine-point-nine of the time it works. For you kids who are addicted to this thing like I am \u2026\u201d But I was not a kid, I was a 31-year-old grownup. The shame I felt when I popped my last non-working pod into the freezer felt like rock bottom.\nVaping wasn\u2019t something I could stomp out on the ground and move on from. Strong willpower, my embarrassment, and at the time, the CDC\u2019s recommendation that people give up vaping of all kinds until the cause of the lung damage was determined \u2013 none of it mattered. The benefit of being an adult with this addiction is that I had the resources for cessation products, and if necessary I could work with an addiction specialist. It took hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of the highest-dose patches and a mix of nicotine mints and gum for me to stop searching for loose pods around my apartment. With 5 million teens caught in this trap, I don\u2019t think bans on e-cigarette flavors will stop resourceful young people like the shirtless high schooler from finding ways to fend off the agitation, inability to focus, and headaches that come with trying to quit. Instead of imposing unreasonable laws, we need to figure out and share tangible ways for different people who are addicted to quit \u2013 and that information should be as easy to find as the steps to fix a leaking pod.\nAfter I\u2019d been off the juice for a month, I was walking to my office one morning when I saw an empty cartridge on the sidewalk. I asked myself, if this were full, would I pick it up and use it? The answer was yes. Another hit, another drag, another puff, just one more. It doesn\u2019t have a flame, but it never burns out.", "label": 0}, "text-145": {"text": "Mind control, levitation and no pain: the race to find a superman in sport\nCandlestick Park, San Francisco, 1964. The wind is whipping off the Bay on a typically cold night at the ballpark. Mike Murphy takes his seat in Section 17. A jazz band pipes up and the vendors shout their wares: Hamm\u2019s or Falstaff beers, Oscar Mayer hot dogs with Gulden\u2019s mustard. Murphy is close enough to talk to the San Francisco Giants players \u2013 but he\u2019s not interested in hero worship. He wants to put a voodoo curse on the opposition, the LA Dodgers.\nHe tells two friends it\u2019s called a \u201cwhammy\u201d or \u201coccult backlash\u201d. He\u2019s been practising for years, perfecting the very particular cries and exact hand gestures to transmit negative energy to players. He reckons he\u2019s a baseball witch doctor, sending psychic waves to scramble minds and zap energy from muscles.\nWhile sitting in the bleachers at Candlestick Park, Murphy asked for assistance from the fellow Giants fans around him to explore his powers, explaining with a straight-face that the gestures had been developed by shamans in the Amazon basin to kill enemies. If they wanted the Giants to win, this would help. And so he exhorted the crowd to close their two middle fingers over the thumb, leaving the index finger and little finger pointing, like devil horns, towards their target. And he told them to shout and wail as they thrust their horns towards the Dodgers players.\nThat night would prove Murphy\u2019s most successful as a conjuring cheerleader; according to his account, he enlisted almost 200 fans, all their negative energy flowing through him as he stood at the front, like the arrowhead. With several hundred horns pointing towards the tip, he began to feel dizzy. Whenever the wave of gestures and curses was at its strongest, the Dodgers began to make inept plays. The Giants went on to win.\nMurphy staggered out of the stadium, drained, exhausted and fearing a heart attack. But believing that he had made it happen.\nBaguio City, the Philippines, 14 years later. Mental combat has begun for the World Chess Championship. Anatoly Karpov, the golden boy of the Soviet Union, is playing Viktor Korchnoi, a defector the regime loves to hate. Despite sitting opposite each other for hour after hour, day after day, they have not spoken. But somebody is talking to Korchnoi. There is a voice inside his head. It is incessant. Over and over and over it berates him: \u201cYOU. MUST. LOSE.\u201d\nKorchnoi recognises the voice. It\u2019s not his. It belongs to the man sitting in the front row of the audience since the match began. His heart starts to beat a little faster. He begins to sweat.\n\u201cYOU. SHOULD. STOP. FIGHT. AGAINST. KARPOV.\u201d\nThe demands keep coming. Korchnoi is not afraid but he is angry. He understands perfectly what is happening. The man is trying to control his thoughts.\n\u201cYOU. ARE. TRAITOR. OF. SOVIET. PEOPLE.\u201d\nThe man sits cross-legged, dressed immaculately in a white shirt and dark brown suit, reclining with a hint of arrogance. He looks like an accountant, albeit a somewhat demented one. A slight smirk plays across his face. His eyes are terrifying, bearing into Korchnoi. He does not blink until Korchnoi is defeated.\nBoth of these stories are true. Murphy, the zany hippy in bell-bottom jeans warbling occult orders, would, in time, have the US government dancing to his tune. And Dr Vladimir Zoukhar, the immaculately dressed communist spook, staring demonically for comrade and country, was considered the KGB\u2019s mind control expert. Both men were protagonists in an extraordinarily paranoid chapter of human history: the cold war.\nMurphy was no regular football fan. Known as \u201cthe godfather of the human potential movement\u201d, he co-founded the Esalen Institute, a famed new age retreat and pillar of the counterculture movement in 60s California. It was a centre for eastern religions, philosophy, alternative medicines, and a fair amount of nude hot-tub bathing. Controversial eroticist Henry Miller swam at the hot springs in the grounds, Beatle George Harrison once landed his helicopter there to jam with Ravi Shankar, and Timothy Leary, whom Richard Nixon called \u201cthe most dangerous man in America\u201d, taught regular workshops on the benefits of LSD, claiming that women could orgasm hundreds of times during sex when under the influence. And most recently, in the final frames of Mad Men, advertising executive Don Draper was seen smiling on Esalen\u2019s lawn.\nWhile Murphy was establishing Esalen, if Soviet state security wanted to place a negative or damaging thought in someone\u2019s head, they called Zoukhar. That\u2019s why Zoukhar was at Korchnoi\u2019s match; communism trumped capitalism if it could produce a world chess champion. Korchnoi, hang-dogged and pot-bellied with his mistress in tow, was not the image they were going for. He could not be allowed to win against Karpov, the poster boy for true Soviet values.\nMurphy and Zoukhar hailed from opposite cultures teetering on the brink of nuclear Armageddon. But for all their differences, America and the Soviet Union held a common belief: the existence of superhumans. Both world powers believed in a race of cosmic beings who could, just like in the sci-fi movies, slow down time, speed it up, change their body shape, feel no pain, levitate, see into the future, and more. With boggle-eyed mind control and harnessing the occult, both nations believed they could put a thought in someone\u2019s head, or stop a man\u2019s heart at 100 paces. Both nations thought these powers would win them the war. From the west coast of America to the far corners of the Soviet Union, yogis, shamans and psychics were sought out to aid these alternative war efforts, with millions spent on attempts to create a real life Superman or Wonder Woman.\nSince the first millennium, Hindus and Buddhists have believed that spiritual practice \u2013 like yoga \u2013 was capable of giving rise to a siddhi, a Sanskrit word that roughly translates as \u201csuperpower\u201d. Siddhis included an ability to master pain, levitation, invisibility, being able to read minds at a distance \u2013 basically, any comic book superpower you can think of. And in America, Murphy was Professor X, and Esalen was his Westchester Academy.\nAs a trust-fund kid at Stanford University, Murphy had once wanted to be a priest, maybe a scientist; his parents preferred doctor. But on the second day of spring classes in 1950, Murphy went to the wrong classroom and ended up listening to a comparative religion lecture. It was providence. Murphy was hooked. He quit his class, enrolled in Indian philosophy and devoured The Life Divine, a 1939 book by Indian mystic, yogi, guru and poet Sri Aurobindo. It was a handbook for spiritual powers. From then on, Murphy would dedicate his life to the pursuit of the extraordinary.\nHunter S Thompson was Esalen's first security guard; Aldous Huxley, then often high on mescaline, helped establish it\nIt just so happened that there was a big chunk of Murphy family land on the cliffs of Big Sur, California, which would do nicely as a base for teaching superpowers. Murphy provided the land , and his friend Dick Price, a co-founder, brought the cash. Before Esalen even opened, in 1962, the plot needed a security guard; a young Hunter S Thompson, pioneer of gonzo journalism, got the job.\n\u201cHe was 21,\u201d Murphy told me, on our first phone call. \u201cUnpublished. Fully armed. With a small arsenal. He seemed to love tracer bullets. He\u2019d fire hundreds out into the night sky so every night was like the fourth of July. Sometimes he\u2019d fire his gun out of the unopened window of one of the houses that was on the grounds.\u201d\nThompson was the first of many colourful and culturally significant characters in the Esalen story. Aldous Huxley, the English novelist and psychedelic grand philosopher, followed. He was another inspiration for Murphy, who attended a Huxley lecture at the University of California with Price, entitled Human Potentialities, in 1962. Huxley, then often high on mescaline, was a key figure in Esalen\u2019s establishment, before his death a year later from throat cancer.\nMurphy believed that the best place for the superpowers to reveal themselves was on the sports field. Sports, he said, was the west\u2019s yoga. He collated thousands of stories of athletes describing siddhis experiences. John Brodie, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, once told Murphy that he could move the ball with the power of his mind and reported seeing rivals shape-shift to avoid tackles. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of the martial art aikido, was said to be able to make himself invisible. Murphy found \u201cscores\u201d of reliable witnesses who had seen Ueshiba elude attacks, with one writing: \u201cCompletely surrounded by men with knives, Ueshiba disappeared and reappeared at the same instant, looking down at his attackers from the top of a flight of stairs.\u201d\nWhat about a human passing through solid matter? Murphy cites Pel\u00e9, one of the world\u2019s greatest footballers, as once saying: \u201cI felt that I could dribble through any of their team \u2026 that I could pass through them physically.\u201d In 1970, ice hockey star Bobby Orr was said to have called on abilities of thought projection to hypnotise Chicago Black Hawk players during a four-game winning sequence on the way to the Stanley Cup finals for his Bruins team.\nUnsurprisingly, the American military and CIA began to take note of Esalen. Prompted by intelligence reports about the Soviets experiments, the Americans felt they had to start programmes of their own, in which Murphy would become a key figure. His friendship with Democratic senator Claiborne Pell, a supporter of Esalen and Murphy\u2019s jogging partner, was instrumental. In White House intelligence meetings, Pell spoke forcefully of the benefits of supporting their experiments. He argued that if the Russians had it, and the Americans didn\u2019t, they would be in serious trouble.\nMurphy was an adviser for the Jedi warrior training programme at West Point Military Academy in New York. Code-named Project Jedi, soldiers in the programme were taught invisibility, seeing into the future and extraordinary intuition, like knowing how many chairs were in a room before walking in \u2013 but also stopping the hearts of animals. It was similar to the First Earth Battalion (FEB), best known from the movie The Men Who Stare at Goats. Jim Channon, the founder of the FEB, thought it a good idea that each of his \u201cwarrior monks\u201d should carry pouches of herbs into battle, give out flowers as a sign of peace, and play indigenous music to calm and confuse the enemy. Channon had been given a small Pentagon budget and two years to research ways for the US military to use new age methods in warfare. He spent most of that time at Esalen, being taught by Murphy.\nIn 1975, the Chicago Tribune reported that the CIA was attempting to develop a new kind of \u201cspook\u201d, after finding a man who could \u201csee\u201d what was going on anywhere in the world. CIA scientists would show the man a picture of a place, and he would then describe any activity going on there at that time.\nIn fact, there was more than one of these men. Russell Targ, who had taught this psychic power at Esalen, was one; another was Uri Geller. (You might have heard of him and his bendy spoons.) There was a whole team of psychics based at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California, as part of the CIA\u2019s Stargate programme to find psychic warriors. Targ and Geller would sit in that office, close their eyes, breathe deeply and then after a few minutes draw the location of Soviet missiles. Sometimes, they were right.\nBy contrast to the Soviet plan, Targ and Geller seemed harmless. \u201cThey were using it to kill people,\u201d Targ said. The Russian term for superpowers was \u201cHidden Human Reserves\u201d.\n\u201cThey created a replica of the Oval Office and they would have people in there 24 hours a day concentrating on the US president in such a way to try to muddle his thinking,\u201d said Jim Hickman, a key figure at Esalen during the cold war. Hickman spent much of the 70s and 80s travelling in the USSR to research siddhis, often with Murphy at his side. Hickman told me they learned about strange, disturbing things. Even stranger and more disturbing than a whole bunch of Dr Zoukhars trying to influence the thought patterns of a head of state from great distances? \u201cThere was much deeper work going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew that we were only talking to the people they let us talk to.\u201d\nIn one creepy experiment, scientists implanted electrodes in a mother rabbit\u2019s brain, took her young litter off to a submarine and killed them one by one\nThose people were probably among the 60 Soviet-based scientists who worked at what was called Special Department 8. Their job was to investigate distant mind control. It was just one of 40 centres at Science City, Novosibirsk, in south-west Siberia, which housed thousands of scientists and their families from across the communist bloc, in a kind of nerdy utopia. Road names included Calculators Street, Thermophysics Street and Hydrodynamics Square. Here, Soviet scientists were attempting to prove the existence of extrasensory perception (ESP). In one creepy experiment, the scientists implanted electrodes in a mother rabbit\u2019s brain, took her young litter off to a submarine and, when it was deep below the surface, killed them one by one. At each synchronised time of death, the mother\u2019s brain reacted.\nAt the Kharkov University Neurology Institute, the rat brains were attached to electrodes and put in solution. The best Russian psychics, having been tested in research centres dotted around the state, were brought in to transmit emotions and thoughts to the brains. The most popular response recorded was laughing but the brains also \u201cenjoyed\u201d sums. (It is not known whether the brains were better at fractions or algebra.)\nUnsurprisingly, some of the morally questionable experiments began to make the experts feel uncomfortable. One lab was even shut down in 1974 as the resident scientists en masse rejected what they called \u201cthe negative work\u201d.\nIt is widely believed that a mega-secret lab was set up in its place, in a sub-sub-basement below the Filatov Institute in Odessa. Only clandestine couriers knew how to access these secret paranormal departments. KGB guards made sure there were no unwanted visitors. There, death row prisoners were \u201cbombarded\u201d with pulsing magnetic fields to see if they would become clairvoyant. Years later, in 1991, one Dr Bryukhanov would publicly claim that he had run the project and said they had believed that animals they tested it on had developed the ability to see through walls. Alas, their small animal brains could not cope with the onslaught from the magnetic fields, and simply disintegrated. The prisoners reportedly suffered the same, horrible fate.\nBy 1984, the cold war was heating up. The Doomsday Clock, the timepiece those cheery folk at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists kept ticking to judge how close man-made global catastrophe was, nudged the little hand to three minutes to midnight and oblivion. Luckily, help was at hand in the most unlikely of places. The hippies, gurus, shamen and yogis wanted to start a thaw and they knew exactly how to do it: nude hot-tub bathing.\nWith their friends in Washington giving them a nod and a wink, a series of Soviet \u2013 American exchanges had been organised from 1980. After several visits, Murphy and Hickman revealed they had discovered a Soviet Esalen: a group of believers and free thinkers who believed in the existence of siddhis. Contacts ranged from the obligatory psychic to Kremlin influencers. As a result, astronauts and cosmonauts, writers, KGB agents, military veterans, politicians (like Claiborne Pell) and diplomats were frequently invited to Esalen. There, they were told to sit crosslegged on the floor with pillows and just talk to each other. Then it was time to jump in the hot tub.\nThe idea behind the exchanges was to convince Americans and Russians to recognise that they were not so different after all. The brains at Esalen wanted to call this project The Institute for Theoretical Studies. When someone pointed out that the acronym for that was TITS, it was renamed the Esalen Soviet-American Exchange Program. It still exists today, albeit under a different name \u2013 Track Two: An Institute for Citizen Diplomacy \u2013 and is run by Murphy\u2019s wife, Dulce.\n\u201cWe had KGB guys and CIA guys at Esalen talking to each other,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe KGB knew communism wasn\u2019t working. It was their job to know everything \u2026 they could fucking see it. When we hosted people, it was just confirming what they already knew.\u201d\nThe exchange programme\u2019s biggest coup was bringing Boris Yeltsin to America in 1989. At the time, as a critic of the communist regime, Yeltsin was considered a political lightning rod. It was a visit that played a part in ending the cold war.\nYeltsin\u2019s aides had contacted Russian activists connected to Hickman and Murphy, and took part in Esalen\u2019s exchange programme.They asked the institute to ask if they would be interested in hosting Yeltsin.\n\u201cIt turned out to be a gigantic deal \u2019cos he flipped!\u201d Murphy said.\nWhen Boris Yeltsin visited a Houston grocery store, he sobered up quickly. He was shocked by the bountiful aisles \u2013 with no queues \u2013 and felt sick with despair\nYeltsin spent most of the trip drunk. But when he visited a Houston grocery store, called Randall\u2019s, he sobered up pretty quickly. One of the Communist party\u2019s great lies was that America staged its wealthy image through fake stores. He was shocked by the bountiful aisles of meats, cheeses and vegetables. He asked why no one was queuing. He stopped shoppers to ask how much they earned per month and what they spent on food. Yeltsin became upset. \u201cWhen I saw those shelves crammed with hundreds, thousands of cans, cartons and goods of every possible sort, for the first time I felt quite frankly sick with despair for the Soviet people,\u201d Yeltsin later wrote in his autobiography. Two years after that supermarket trip, he quit the party, stood on a tank in Red Square and became a capitalist. It was the start of the Iron Curtain\u2019s fall.\nBut neither side stopped searching for a superman. Murphy, now approaching his 90s, is still looking. Every year he holds a conference, the Sports, Energy and Consciousness festival in San Francisco, where he holds workshops advising people how they can experience the siddhis. The American military haven\u2019t stopped, either, spending millions of dollars a year on research for \u201calternative powers\u201d. And just like the Russians and their chess experiment, they are using the sports field as a training ground.\n\u2022 This is an edited extract from Ed Hawkins\u2019 new book The Men on Magic Carpets: Searching for the Superhuman Sports Star (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99).", "label": 0}, "text-146": {"text": "Matt Hancock asks MPs and peers for views on adult social care reform\nMatt Hancock has written to MPs and peers, urging them to help secure a cross-party consensus on reform of the adult social care system, as the government commits to finding an answer to the ongoing problem.\nIn his letter, the health secretary says he is determined to find a sustainable solution to the problem of people being hit by large costs that are hard to plan for when their loved ones require social care.\n\u201cWe know this will not be easy,\u201d Hancock said in his letter. \u201cThe number of reports that have been published in recent years with different suggested approaches shows how difficult it is to reach agreement on the best way to reform the social care system.\u201d\nThe government has committed to the principle that nobody should be forced to sell their home to pay for care, saying that everybody accessing care must have safety and security.\nThe letter sets out a two-step timeline for social care reform talks. The first phase began on Friday, calling for the views of MPs. The next steps will be structured talks in May on reform options. The letter says Hancock welcomed \u201call views, proposed solutions, and concerns about reforming the way people pay for adult social care\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAny solution also needs to consider the financial impact on taxpayers as a whole, and the competing demands on taxpayers\u2019 money from other public services.\u201d\nBut Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health and social care, said: \u201cThe prime minister promised voters that he had a plan to fix the social care crisis but now all we see is an open-ended invitation for comments.\n\u201cAs we have repeatedly said, cross-party talks can only be effective when the government comes forward with their proposals for reform. It\u2019s clear that it doesn\u2019t have a plan to fix the crisis in social care.\n\u201cLabour has offered to engage in meaningful cross-party talks and we would be happy to do so, but the process outlined by Matt Hancock is another consultation that provides no help to a system in crisis.\u201d\nCaroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, agreed: \u201cUnfortunately, this announcement, issued on a Friday afternoon, will not fill anyone who cares about the future of social care with much confidence.\n\u201cIt is always good for ministers to seek alternative views, but it is very disappointing that they appear not to be offering any of their own at this stage. A cross-party process would surely have a greater chance of success if ministers were setting out some kind of basis for discussion, rather than leaving it to everyone to pitch in from their own starting point.\u201d\nJames Heywood, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: \u201cWe welcome the government starting the ball rolling on seeking cross-party consensus on social care reform. This issue has been ducked by successive governments, and the 2017 election campaign showed that meaningful reform is more likely to be achieved with cross-party support.\u201d\nCatherine Foot, the director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: \u201cThese steps towards a solution to the social care crisis are welcome but must lead to real action on what is one of the most pressing issues we face today.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-147": {"text": "Hundreds of workers defy Amazon rules to protest company's climate failures\nHundreds of Amazon employees defied corporate policy to publicly criticize the company for failing to meet its \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d in the climate crisis.\nMore than 340 tech workers at Amazon used the hashtag #AMZNSpeakOut in public statements that condemn the company for not taking sufficient action on the climate crisis.\nThe action comes in direct opposition to an Amazon policy barring employees from speaking about the company\u2019s business without prior approval from management. That policy was introduced after employees vowed to participate in the global climate strikes of September 2019.\n\u201cEvery person who shared a statement had to decide for themselves that whatever the consequences, they needed to stand up for what they felt was right,\u201d Victoria Liang, a software development engineer at Amazon who joined the public action, said. \u201cThe climate crisis is just that urgent. We just couldn\u2019t be silenced by these policies on issues of such moral weight.\u201d\nEmployees at Amazon have increasingly criticized the company in recent years for its contracts with large oil and gas firms. In spring 2019, more than 8,700 employees signed an open letter to the CEO, Jeff Bezos, urging him to take bolder action on climate change. The presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have also offered support of employees for speaking out.\nThe employee activism is part of a broader trend in the tech industry of employee walkouts and protests against corporate policies. Google workers staged internal protests over sexual harassment policies in 2018 that continued into 2019 and gig workers at Instacart and Uber have organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits. In June 2019, workers at the online furnishings retailer Wayfair walked off the job to oppose the company\u2019s contracts with detention centers for immigrants.\nAn Amazon spokeswoman said the company was aware of the employee actions. She added that the external communication policy had been updated in spring 2019 but was not directed at any one group of employees. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 and 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\u201cWhile all employees are welcome to engage constructively with any of the many teams inside Amazon that work on sustainability and other topics, we do enforce our external communications policy and will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems,\u201d she said.\nIn January, at least three employees said they were threatened with termination for speaking publicly about environmental issues, stoking further protests against the new policy.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to work at Amazon, but policies that silence employees who are challenging us to do better runs counter to our own leadership principles,\u201d said Nolan Woodle, an associate contracts manager at Amazon. \u201cWhen there is an issue of such importance, we have to be able to talk about it. Silencing employees is simply not the right approach.\u201d\nMeanwhile, other companies appear to be responding to employee unrest. In January 2020, Microsoft announced it would be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by the end of the decade after a number of global actions orchestrated by employees.\nAmazon\u2019s big tech counterpart Google also appears to be making public responses to the organizing. On the job platform LinkedIn on Monday, someone listing himself as a hiring manager at Google left a post that appeared to attempt to recruit defectors from Amazon to the company.\n\u201cI recognize your courage and bravery to speak out about climate change,\u201d he wrote, linking to a post on how Google is \u201cworking to battle climate change\u201d.

Launched just six weeks ago, it secured 32% of the vote. Taking to the stage having just been re-elected at the South East England count, Nigel Farage proclaimed that if Britain did not leave on 31 October, then his new party would face down the Conservatives and Labour at the next general election.\nThose who point out that the parties committed to a no-deal Brexit only achieved around a third of the vote \u2013 and were outvoted by unambiguously pro-remain parties \u2013 are missing the point. Farage\u2019s project has always been to reshape the right of politics. His has never been a majoritarian project, but it never had to be. Ten years after taking over as Ukip leader in 2006, Farage had successfully manoeuvred the European Union to the centre of British politics, leading to the vote to leave.\nJust as Farage used the 2014 European election result to force the Tories into offering the 2016 referendum, he will use the 2019 result to push the Tories into backing a no-deal exit by making the end of October deadline firm. Farage knows there is no other deal on offer than the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, thrice-defeated in parliament and politically dead. To demand that date is to insist on no deal.\nBizarrely, having campaigned for a no-deal Brexit in these elections, Farage also demanded a place in the UK\u2019s negotiating team, trumpeting the business experience of many of his party\u2019s candidates. But this wasn\u2019t a sincere demand to negotiate for nothing \u2013 it is part of a strategy to avoid the blame in no-deal chaos. If the UK does crash out on Halloween, you can be sure that Farage won\u2019t take any responsibility for it. He will claim he would have negotiated a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d, yet another cloak for an unquestionably extreme policy.\nBut Farage\u2019s message was not just about Brexit. During the campaign, he and his populist troupe of pantomime villains launched a full-frontal assault on the establishment. Farage used tactics reminiscent of the \u201cstab-in-the-back\u201d policy first adopted by the far right in Germany in the 1920s, becoming a central piece of the Nazi narrative in the 1930s. He repeatedly claimed that the British negotiating team were the \u201cenemy within\u201d, that May\u2019s deal could \u201conly have been signed by a nation defeated in war\u201d, and that the people had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d. Combined with his attacks on the media, Farage has adopted the Trump playbook: undermine sources of facts so that people are left to trust only their instincts, not institutions. Farage himself may not be a demagogue, but in this campaign he has laid the foundations for demagoguery.\nYet there are still reasons to be hopeful. The labour movement is and has always been the most powerful force against the far right in this country and across Europe. From Cable Street to the BNP, it has always fought back. It was not deployed properly in these elections, leaving Farage free to storm across the battlefield. The Labour leadership\u2019s disastrous strategy was to sit these elections out; the architects of that approach in the leader\u2019s office are now under pressure to quit. Farage won\u2019t be so lucky again.\nAs Tory leadership contenders commit to no deal in the face of the rise of the Brexit party, it has become more apparent that one-nation Conservatives will stand in their way. Even the chancellor, Philip Hammond, left open the possibility that he would vote for a no-confidence motion to prevent a no-deal exit. The Labour party has sat on the fence on a negotiated exit, but has always been clear that it will oppose a no-deal Brexit, and this appalling result should shock the party into mobilising to fight for the people to have the final say and for the country to vote to remain.\nFarage is shaping British politics once again and in a dangerous direction. It is time for all decent people to resist his devious tune. The European elections aren\u2019t a wake-up call to deliver Brexit at any cost. They are a clear message to fight the only Brexit now available \u2013 a no-deal crash-out that could tip millions more into poverty and humiliate this country on the world stage.

The New York Times announced the process and date for revealing which candidate it will endorse on the very crowded Democratic ticket, and Facebook reiterated its policies (or maybe lack of them) on political advertising.\nMany things have happened since the 2016 election to both the press and technology companies, in terms of examining their respective roles in democracy. And while there have been plenty of laments that too little has changed in the intervening four years, the truth is that one thing \u2013 control of the media \u2013 has changed significantly.\nIf you want to find out what one of the house journals of the Democratic establishment thinks of the party\u2019s candidates, mark your calendars for 19 January. The New York Times has been putting a thumb on the electoral scale since 1860, but this time its opinion desk is moving if not towards radical transparency, then at least towards a little reader-driven openness, by publishing transcripts of candidate interviews and offering some insight into its deliberations.\nThe antediluvian practice of a news organisation declaring for a candidate and party is a necessary ritual, not least for the news organisations themselves, and it has the benefit of stoking public conversation around the democratic process. Insofar as influence goes, though, it is more akin to a vicar saying daily prayers in an empty church. News organisation endorsements are not what win elections. What do win them are narrowly targeted ad campaigns, according to people who sell narrowly targeted ad campaigns.\nIf one is to believe the internal communication to Facebook colleagues from executive Andrew Bosworth, which surfaced last week, the 2016 election was won not by the interference of Russian troll factories, or by the psychometric salesmen at Cambridge Analytica, but because Trump, in Bosworth\u2019s words \u201cran the single best digital ad campaign I\u2019ve ever seen from any advertiser\u201d.\nGiven the Trump campaign spent heavily on Facebook and benefited from teams of Facebook employees embedded within the campaign, Bosworth might have substituted \u201che\u201d for \u201cwe\u201d. The rambling memo, which included a mishmash of insights from Lord of the Rings and the philosopher John Rawls, was a rather effective way of informally signalling how Facebook management was thinking about its role in elections ahead of 2020.\nPresidents and prime ministers can succeed by telling lies and avoiding any accountability in terms of public scrutiny\nBosworth started his missive by explaining why Facebook would not use its own tools and practices to decide the outcome of the next election, even if that meant the election of a lying candidate. Facebook will, it seems, only put its thumb on the scale for a candidate or campaign when paid to do so, as a vehicle for targeted advertising.\nBosworth\u2019s memo provided an early smokescreen for an announcement later in the week that Facebook was holding fast to its policy of not fact-checking or removing untruthful statements in political advertising. For those concerned about the fairness of elections, this was a disappointing response. Even a very low bar for claims would be better than no bar and, much more importantly, an agreement to stop using the targeting methods which segment voters on an individual level would limit the vast opportunities to run dishonest campaigns.\nIt has always made commercial sense for Facebook to refuse to be the regulator for political advertising, for two key reasons. First, it doesn\u2019t actually have the human capacity or skill to reliably check and remove untruthful campaign material.\nAnd second, because some of its biggest and most powerful clients \u2013 political parties and governments \u2013 don\u2019t want it to. On a broader principle, media companies should be setting their own standards for what is acceptable and ethical \u2013 but they should not be setting the rules for the rest of society.\nIn 2016, the Trump campaign ran 5.9m different advertisements in six months, compared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s negligible 66,000, each one a subtle variant which can be created, tested and targeted. It is a system that cannot be effectively policed without either a change of business model or more stringent external regulation. The persuasion of societies happens through multivariate testing of different messages, whether buying bed sheets or elections.\nWe know a great deal more about the dynamics of how information and misinformation is deployed during elections than we did in 2016. Media gatekeepers, which are now principally companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple, are still struggling to develop both methods and organisational cultures that meet the role.\nThe persuasion of societies happens through multivariate testing of messages, whether buying bed sheets or elections\nThose that have been losing control of gatekeeping over two decades, the news organisations, have bigger problems. In the past four years the media in the US and UK have learned what other parts of the world woke up to some time ago: namely, that politicians can be elected without ever engaging with the news media.\nPresidents and prime ministers can succeed by telling lies and avoiding any accountability in terms of public scrutiny. This is a global phenomenon \u2013 Narendra Modi, India\u2019s charismatic authoritarian leader, has never held a press conference. The White House press secretary has not held a briefing for half a year \u2013 not even in the last week, when the US has teetered on the brink of a war.\nPoliticians across the spectrum understand that there is little to be gained by subjecting themselves even to good faith questioning. When the Conservative government is reportedly considering no longer participating in a serious programme such as Newsnight because its new policy editor, Lewis Goodall, was active in student politics a long time ago, it is hoping to read the last rites over any type of difficult public questioning. Who would seek out this kind of scrutiny when they could just stick to their own accounts on social media?\nWhat comes with it \u2013 the trolling, disinformation, virtual and real threats \u2013 only serve to remove the more fair-minded. Set against this trajectory, Facebook\u2019s policy of applying less scrutiny to political advertising than other types looks more reckless than reasonable.\nEven with the impossibility of policing, the reduction in revenue and likely evasion of any rules, it would be good to know that the new gatekeepers understand the importance of demonstrating their own values.

On Sunday the Observer, in backing Corbyn\u2019s play, still referred to him as \u201ccareless of division and widely distrusted\u201d. Dominic Grieve, in a cautious not-quite-rejection of the plan, referred to Corbyn as a \u201cdeeply divisive figure\u201d.\nAs criticisms go, it is a fair one. There have been few figures since Maragaret Thatcher who have polarised politics in quite the same way. Yet, as a criticism, there is something off about it. Should politics not be divisive? Is it not, when you get right down to it, a conflict of opposing forces trying to wrestle power from each other? How did we get to a place where \u201cdivisive\u201d was seen as a criticism rather than a bald statement of simple fact?\nTwenty years ago there was a feeling of consensus across the west\u2019s elite thinkers. The big questions of politics had been solved; there was a right answer after all. Economic growth led to development; development led to the blooming of liberal values; more liberal and open economies were better for growth. The whole thing was a virtuous cycle that could be packaged and exported across the world. Yes, there was the occasional war, or massive terrorist attack, and yes global warming was a looming problem, but those were mere details. The future was bright.\nAnd yet, it doesn\u2019t seem to have worked out that way. Tony Blair tried to harness the dynamism of capital to fund a more equitable society, but without structural reform at its foundation the project was washed away like a house built on sand at the first sign of economic crisis. In 2010 the Liberal Democrats, supported by an army of voters who had been sold a promise of a more liberal alternative to Gordon Brown, tried to ally with the Conservatives to moderate them. Five years later those same voters punished them for their folly after the Tories proved inherently immoderable. As much as we believe we can cling to the tiger\u2019s back, there is an inexorable logic to the power of capital that eventually consumes all our attempts to tame it.\nThe promise of the virtuous cycle was not broken by \u201cdivisive\u201d figures \u2013 they have simply exposed it as false. Productivity growth and technological advancement have given us a society with an abundance of resources, and yet Iain Duncan Smith still comes out and tell us there\u2019s nothing in the pot, and you all have to work until you\u2019re 75. People are right to ask where all the wealth has gone, and why there\u2019s nothing left for them. How can we be producing so much more per person than we were 100 years ago, yet still can\u2019t spare any of that surplus even for our retirees?\nCorbyn is a divisive figure, but so is Boris Johnson, so were Theresa May and David Cameron, so was Blair\nThe answer is that we could, but Iain Duncan Smith does not want to. He prefers to maintain a system where that surplus can be stashed away by the increasingly rarefied financial elite, even though they are already the richest humans to have ever lived. This position is not called \u201cdivisive\u201d, even though it is surely going to prove immensely unpopular. Being divisive does not, under examination, mean causing division, but drawing attention to divisions that already exist.\nBarack Obama, one of the most conciliatory moderates ever to hold the office of president of the US, was accused of stoking racial divisions. Why? Because his mere existence as a black man put a spotlight on the unhealed wounds and the festering white supremacy that people had chosen to believe were mere relics of the past. The New York Times has been accused of being divisive with the publication of its 1619 project, which examines slavery\u2019s pivotal role in shaping American history, for the same reason.\nTo be divisive is to not let people look away. It is to turn and say to those who have been ignored for being inconvenient: \u201cWe believe you, you\u2019re not making it up, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s real and it\u2019s bad and it should change.\u201d That upsets people who are comfortable with things the way they are \u2013 which is really what divisive means, when it comes down to it.\nCorbyn is a divisive figure, but so is Boris Johnson, so were Theresa May and David Cameron, so was Blair. It\u2019s just that the people who were divided away by them weren\u2019t considered important. The poor, the \u201cloony left\u201d, the disabled, the foreign \u2013 none of them mattered and so the solid core of people who remained could say: \u201cLook how unified we are, look how we compromise like adults.\u201d But it\u2019s a shallow kind of compromise, where you only ask the people who already broadly agree with you.\nCorbyn\u2019s divisiveness in this context is what underlies his appeal, and that\u2019s why the calls for him to step aside for a more unifying figure are so tone-deaf. If he were acceptable to the current holders of power in this country, then he wouldn\u2019t be any use to us. \nExposing division is not the same as causing it. Eventually we are going to have to stop saying \u201cyou\u2019re dividing us\u201d and start asking: \u201cWhich side do I need to be on?\u201d\n\u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy", "label": 0}, "text-153": {"text": "Oil regulator to revise remit to address climate crisis\nBritain\u2019s oil industry watchdog plans to overhaul its mission to wring as much value from the North Sea\u2019s oil reserves as possible before the UN climate talks this year.\nThe Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) was due to meet a government minister on Wednesday afternoon to discuss how the regulator, which was set up to extend the life of the North Sea, could play a part in tackling the climate crisis.\nAndy Samuel, the OGA\u2019s chief executive, told delegates at an industry conference that the watchdog was considering how it could help the UK meet its climate targets and would open a consultation on how to redefine the OGA\u2019s strategy within the coming months. \u201cWe will be discussing this with a minister this afternoon,\u201d he said.\nThe overhaul follows a pledge by Ofgem, the energy regulator, to play a bigger role in helping to meet the government\u2019s climate targets, after coming under fire for failing to prioritise the climate emergency.\nThe OGA was established five years ago by the government to extend the life of the North Sea, after the oil price crash cast doubt over the future of the UK\u2019s ageing oil basin. Since then, the statutory duty has raised questions over whether it is compatible with the government\u2019s commitment to tackling the climate crisis.\nThe regulator\u2019s new strategy is expected to align its work safeguarding North Sea jobs and investment with the UK\u2019s legally binding ambition to cut carbon emissions virtually to zero by 2050.\nThis is likely to pile pressure on North Sea firms to shrink their carbon footprints by reducing flaring and methane leaks, and even use renewable energy to run the rigs.\nThe OGA is also likely to push for companies to collaborate on big investments in carbon capture technology and clean hydrogen production, which could help the UK meet its net zero targets.\nThe strategy may also mean the North Sea produces fewer barrels of oil if companies shift their portfolios from oil towards gas in line with future demand forecasts.\nBob Ward, a director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, welcomed the OGA\u2019s attempt to \u201creconcile the UK\u2019s target for net zero emissions by 2050 with its strategy for maximising economic recovery\u201d from the North Sea.\n\u201cIf the world is serious about achieving the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal, it should mean a global decline in demand for oil and gas. The North Sea has relatively high operating costs compared with other basins, so its oil and gas might be among the first to be priced out of global markets if overall demand falls,\u201d he said, speaking on the sidelines of the International Petroleum Week conference.\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy did not respond to a request for comment.", "label": 0}, "text-154": {"text": "It\u2019s sad, but the nature of public discourse today is becoming more and more about preventing public discourse. As often as people say they want to \u201chave a conversation\u201d about contentious issues, most really don\u2019t. They want to stifle debate, not encourage it.\nTerms like \u201chate speech,\u201d \u201cdog whistle,\u201d and \u201cdenier\u201d are routinely used in the effort to muzzle those who dare to disagree.\nThe reaction to the proposed\u00a0Presidential Committee on Climate Security\u00a0(PCCS) is just the latest example of the trend. The people and organizations that use the term \u201cdenier\u201d to belittle anyone who disagrees with some portion of climate-change orthodoxy are apoplectic about the formation of such a committee. One cannot help but wonder why.\nIf the science is so abundantly clear that the climate is changing almost entirely because of human activities, that those changes are so terrible that extreme measures are called for\u2014at whatever the cost\u2014and that the United States can unilaterally implement mitigation that will have a meaningful and measurable effect, then I would think those who believe all of the above would welcome the creation of the PCCS.\nIt would provide them with a unique opportunity to prove how certainly the \u201cscience is settled\u201d with respect to those diverse aspects of climate change I have described.\nEveryone\u2019s an Expert\nThere\u2019s no shortage of people who have no, or close to no, understanding of climatology, physics, atmospheric chemistry, thermodynamics, or the economics of emissions reductions who are ready to weigh in on climate change with all the certainty of scientists who were once sure that a mysterious substance named \u201cphlogiston\u201d was responsible for the phenomenon we call combustion.\nIn the late 18th\u00a0century, the great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier definitively proved that phlogiston theory was so much hooey. His willingness to question the conventional wisdom of his day may or may not have contributed to him having his life and torso cut short by the mob and the guillotine in 1794.\nClimate change alarmists rush to quote anyone who agrees with them as experts, such as the 58 military veterans who\u00a0signed a letter\u00a0belittling the proposed formation of the PCCS. If any of those veterans understand more about climatology, physics, atmospheric chemistry, thermodynamics, and the economics of emissions reductions than yours truly, I\u2019d love to know it.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that none of them understand any of those issues to a degree that even begins to approach that of climate-change skeptics and professional climatologists like Drs. Roy Spencer and Judith Curry.\nI\u2019m sure the veterans are well intentioned, and I\u2019m certain they are fully qualified to weigh in on questions such as, \u201cIf sea levels rise by X amount, will that affect our naval bases?\u201d But are they experts in the incredibly complicated climate models that are used to predict disaster? Are they experts in all the complex physics and thermodynamics at play? Do they understand the tremendous cost of radical forms of mitigation such as eliminating fossil fuels? I don\u2019t think so.

On the one hand, we\u2019re to believe that their case is so incredibly strong that it should be accepted by everyone without question. On the other hand, given the opportunity to show how settled the science supposedly is, they decline to do so.\nPresumably either, 1) they are unable to boil down the complex aspects of climate science to terms laymen can comprehend, meaning they are lousy teachers, or 2) the public is incapable of understanding, meaning we\u2019re all a bunch of idiots.\nSome have likened climate-change skepticism to belief in a flat Earth. Should the government sponsor a debate about the concept of a flat Earth? Well, if there was sufficient flat Earth belief out there so as to block desperately needed action to prevent global catastrophe, yes!\nNot only should we have that debate in those circumstances, scientists would be lining up in droves to destroy the flat Earth believers. There are so many easily accessible, understandable proofs that the Earth is spherical\u2014proofs dating back to ancient Greece, by the by, that the debate would be a slam dunk victory for reason and sound science.\nIf climate change alarmists are certain that their evidence is as strong and compelling as all of the evidence demonstrating how the Earth is not flat, why would they not embrace the opportunity to do so on the big stage? After all, the fate of the entire planet is supposedly at stake.

Opponents say those targets were unambitious and based on earlier favourable accounting rules won by the Howard government more than 20 years ago.\nLaurence Tubiana, a former French environment minister and architect of the Paris accord, told the Financial Times: \u201cIf you want this carryover it is just cheating. Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system, because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement.\u201d\nUsing the credits would reduce what Australia needs to do to meet its 2030 target of a minimum 26% cut in emissions below 2005 levels by more than half. Analysts said there was no legal basis for Australia using the credits as the Kyoto and Paris agreements were separate treaties, and noted officials had acknowledged Australia was the only country planning to still count them.\nThe conference fell victim to the base positions of a handful of major polluting countries, Australia included\nIn a last-ditch bid to reach agreement on Saturday, a group of nations, led by Costa Rica and including Britain, Germany and New Zealand, released a set of minimum standards for a deal. Described as the \u201cSan Jose principles\u201d, they included an explicit prohibition on the use of carryover credits and other Kyoto-era allowances sought by some major developing countries, particularly Brazil.\nCosta Rica\u2019s environment and energy minister, Carlos Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, called out \u201cAustralia, Brazil and the US\u201d for blocking progress. The group said the steps were necessary to keep open the possibility of limiting industrial global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible, a goal agreed in Paris four years ago.\nJapan, not a signatory to the principles, told the final plenary meeting that it also opposed the use of Kyoto-era credits.\nThe proposed ban was opposed by Australia, Brazil and a small group of other countries. Australian negotiators at the talks argued carryover credits were beyond the scope of a debate over international carbon markets, a main focus of the Madrid talks, and should not be included in that rulebook.\nObservers at the talks said Australia\u2019s team argued using carryover credits was a non-negotiable instruction from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and they were not authorised to compromise.\nRichie Merzian, a former Australian climate diplomat, now with the Australia Institute, said Morrison was increasingly associated with Donald Trump and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro as leading culprits unmoved by fires raging in New South Wales, California and the Amazon. The US has formally signalled its intention to leave the Paris agreement next year.\n\u201cThe conference fell victim to the base positions of a handful of major polluting countries, Australia included,\u201d Merzian said. \nDean Bialek, a former Australian diplomat at the UN, now principal adviser at Mission 2020, the group led by former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said Australia\u2019s diplomatic contribution to the talks was \u201ccynical, irresponsible and ultimately destructive\u201d.\nHe said that it went to the conference to reveal that 80% of its Paris target would be met through an accounting trick showed that Morrison\u2019s claim Australia would meet its Paris target \u201cin a canter\u201d was legally baseless.\n\u201cAlong with the position of the US, it brought to the surface for developing countries that some developed countries were not serious about their commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do this at a time when large swathes of the country are ablaze is frankly unacceptable and would be to the vast majority of the Australian community.\u201d\nAustralia was represented at the talks by the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, but he left on Wednesday, leaving the final negotiations to officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\nOn Monday, Taylor said Australia had \u201creconfirmed\u201d its commitment to the Paris agreement and would continue to work through the UN process to deliver the only outstanding element of the Paris rulebook. He said the latest data showed national emissions were coming down.\nAccording to the government\u2019s quarterly greenhouse accounts, emissions dipped by 0.1% over the year to June, mainly due to a slump in agriculture linked to the drought and Queensland floods. Emissions from industry and resource extraction continued to rise.\nThe Morrison government released emissions projections during the talks that showed it was relying on the use of carryover credits, which it now describes as \u201coverachievement\u201d, to meet its Paris goal. The government assessment found without the credits Australia was expected to achieve just a 16% cut below 2005 levels by 2030. Government advisers previously found Australia\u2019s fair share under a meaningful global deal would be at least 45%.\nA survey of Australian businesses by the Carbon Market Institute released at the talks suggested three-quarters did not support relying on carryover credits.\nCarryover accounting rules were allowed under the Kyoto protocol to encourage countries to be as ambitious as possible. They were not mentioned in the original text of the Paris agreement.\nThis year\u2019s talks focused on what is known as Article 6, governing the workings of the global carbon markets, which are meant to allow countries to pay for emissions cuts where in the globe they are cheapest.\nFew countries came with updated plans to reach the Paris goals. Analysts say much deeper cuts than promised at Paris are needed if countries are to achieve the goals of limiting warming to well below 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible.\nThere were fears the issue of future emissions cuts would be sidelined at the talks, but a \u201chigh ambition coalition\u201d of the EU and many smaller developing countries pressed for a resolution to ask all governments to formulate stronger national plans.\nThe next major round of talks is in Glasgow next November.", "label": 0}, "text-156": {"text": "Artist Gavin Turk arrested in London climate change protest\nThe British artist Gavin Turk has said every member of the public will feel the impact of the climate emergency sooner rather than later, after he was arrested during mass civil disobedience in central London.\nTurk, who was among 82 people arrested during a coordinated occupation of five bridges in the capital, said the pressure to force governments to act to reduce climate change was \u201cthe new future\u201d.\nHe was among scores of people arrested for the obstruction of a public highway on Lambeth Bridge on Saturday in a mass protest to force governments to take action on climate change.

In one case Woolworths failed to declare more than $100,000 in donations to the NSW Liberals and Nationals while seeking to secure minor approvals for a supermarket at Mullumbimby.

After several seconds of deafening silence, Weather Channel meteorologist and global warming activist Heidi Cullen attempted to change the subject. Cullen said our focus should be on longer time periods rather than the 10-year period mentioned by Obama. When pressed, however, she contradicted Obama\u2019s central assertion and said warming has slowed, not accelerated.\nSeveral minutes later, Sen. Jeff Sessions returned to the topic and sought additional clarity. Sessions recited Obama\u2019s quote claiming accelerating global warming during the past 10 years and asked, \u201cDo any of you support that quote?\u201d\nAgain, a prolonged and deafening silence ensued. Neither Cullen nor any of the other experts on the panel spoke a word, not even in an attempt to change the subject.\nBoxer may have envisioned her high-profile global warming hearings as an opportunity to build momentum for congressional or EPA action to restrict carbon dioxide emissions.

Billed as an international multi-sport women\u2019s festival, the event brought together roughly 150 athletes, including Olympic champions and grand slam winners, to compete for Team Americas and Team World in tennis, gymnastics, basketball, ice hockey, figure skating, beach volleyball and table tennis.\nThe mission of the Games, founded by longtime sports executive Jerry Solomon, was to create a platform to celebrate and elevate women athletes. The Aurora Games will be held every two years and has already committed to return to Albany for 2021 and 2023.\nAt a time when women in sports are fighting for equitable pay on the soccer pitch, an end to sexual assault in gymnastics and more professional leagues in ice hockey, the Aurora Games set out to establish a new bar for the production of women\u2019s sports. Whether it succeeded is an open question.\nThe most urgent topics in women\u2019s sports today have been pay equity, creating a professional environment and visibility. It would be difficult for the Aurora Games to successfully be a progressive women\u2019s sporting event without the participating athletes being compensated appropriately.\nTeam Americas ice hockey coach and Aurora Games advisory board member Digit Murphy told the Guardian that ice hockey contracts were set at $2,500 and covered travel, meals, accommodations and other expenses.\n\u201cThey worked for four to five days and they got compensated handsomely. All their expenses are paid, all the bills are paid \u2026 we felt that it was a good number. We felt like it was more than they\u2019re getting paid for a month of the season, for a weekend.\u201d\nMany of the players participating in the Aurora Games played in the now defunct Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League or the National Women\u2019s Hockey League. In the 2018-19 season, women\u2019s pro hockey salaries in North America ranged from $2,000 to $10,000 dollars for a seven-month season.\nMurphy noted she was asked to keep her equipment budget under $10,000, but did not know exactly how much was spent on the ice hockey events. Requests made for the details of the athlete contracts, including compensation, were not offered at the time of publication.\nWomen athletes largely agree pay equity is a process as opposed to a concrete destination. En route to larger salaries, women are also fighting for work conditions appropriate for world class athletes.\n\u201cMy first metric is the athletes. If the athletes say to me, \u2018Hey, thanks for doing this, but this is a stupid idea. No one\u2019s ever gonna play this again.\u2019 That\u2019s not a good metric. The feedback from the athletes so far has been exactly the opposite. That they\u2019ve been really appreciative \u2026 they\u2019ve been talking about how great of an idea it is, how important it is how, how happy they are, to be part of it to be part of the first one that is really meaningful.\u201d\nAthletes have expressed the same sentiment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing and everything around it has been good,\u201d said Swedish ice hockey player Rebecca Stenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first of its kind, so [we\u2019ll] see how it goes. I hope there\u2019s gonna be a lot more of these events and I hope that people see women\u2019s sports in another perspective.\u201d\nAmerican figure skater Mirai Nagasu added, \u201cGrowing up, I was told \u2018I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m a girl.\u2019 I should stick to Barbies and dolls and that\u2019s not always the case. I preferred bugs and throwing myself and taking really hard falls. Skating is a little like parkour with a lot more glitter \u2026 we put sunglasses on how hard we work. We make it look easy, that\u2019s our job. But it\u2019s really cool to be a part of something focused on women and females.\u201d\nHowever, there have been a few things that were not in line with creating the best athlete experience. For starters, the equipment for the first several events, most notably gymnastics and basketball, were damp from the condensation the arena ice created.\nAurora games be like: safety?!? Don\u2019t know her pic.twitter.com/4Ms5kSdnGJ\nDuring Thursday\u2019s basketball shootaround and evening event, towels were placed near the benches and camera crew areas so no water made its way onto the court. During the ice hockey open clinic, a participating athlete noted there was \u201ca lot of work\u201d needed to get the ice to decent condition. The athlete also expressed concerns for the ice along the boards.\nWarmups for tonight's game! #AuroraGames pic.twitter.com/Co94odWItB\nThere were also reports that the beach volleyball participants were not scheduled to have practice time until the day of their event, which had an 11am start time. Reports indicated the players were not originally offered an alternative practice area but that one was secured Saturday.\nSome of these issues were likely due to all six events happening at the same arena in six consecutive days. Albany has already been secured for the 2021 and 2023 Aurora Games. However, Solomon may rethink having all the events in the same arena.\n\u201cWe probably need to be outside of one building,\u201d Solomon said ahead of Thursday\u2019s basketball event. Albany was not a first-choice destination, but was the best choice at the time. While the idea of having all the events in one building was tempting, it proved difficult.\nAnother lesson from the inaugural Aurora Games is that visibility for women\u2019s sports remains an issue. Part of that is drawing on a more global market, Solomon said Thursday. Even if the Aurora Games was able to offer competitive contracts, and could offer a better venue experience for next time, did they do enough to draw in media attention in the first year?\n\u201cWhen you start to get into all this, you find out that the women get 4% of the coverage overall around the world in sports, as men. I actually don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible,\u201d Solomon told the Guardian.\nTo combat that, the Aurora Games partnered with ESPN in their first year. In May, the network announced it would air coverage from all six nights on ESPNU and ESPNews.\nPrint and online media covered the Games as well, but the press corps on hand for the events Thursday through Saturday was sparse. Some told the Guardian they felt the Aurora Games could have done a better job drumming up media attention.\nThe Aurora Games had consistent local coverage and national American outlets such as espnW and The Athletic covered Lindsay Whalen, the coach of the Team Americas basketball. CBC and the Wall Street Journal, and The Telegraph also covered the sports festival. The latter two questioned whether the Games would be successful in drawing crowds.\nOn Sunday, the event announced they drew an overall attendance of 20,423 over six nights, or an average crowd of approximately 3,400 for each session. The Times Union Center has a maximum capacity of 17,500 with the lower bowl seating 6,000 fans, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMurphy was pleased with the crowd of 2,851 fans that watched Team Americas defeat Team World in tennis on Friday night. The lineups included Rogers Cup champion Bianca Andreescu, former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka and two-time major champion Garbine Muguruza.\nThe biggest crowd of the week was for women\u2019s gymnastics, as 4,210 watched American gymnast and viral sensation Katelyn Ohashi scored a perfect 10 on the floor exercise to help Team Americas to the victory.\n\u201cI feel great. I think that it\u2019s a start. There\u2019s a lot of men\u2019s teams that would like 2,000 people at their events that are just starting \u2026 I think generating the buzz and excitement, it was very well done,\u201d she said.\nSolomon added: \u201cSuccess, or lack of success, for the Aurora Games can be measured in a lot of different ways, and by different people in different ways \u2026 Here tonight, you\u2019ll see a basketball game. The one thing we know, they\u2019re great athletes, they\u2019re going to put on the best show that they can. And, you know, if you like basketball, you probably gonna have a good time tonight. But there\u2019s not gonna be a lot of people in the stands. And so, you know, the critic will say, \u2018See, there\u2019s no market for this.\u2019\u201d\nSolomon was right: it wasn\u2019t a great crowd. There were just over 2,500 fans on hand to watch Team World edge out Team Americas, 85-77. However, that will not convince him the event wasn\u2019t a success.\n\u201cI went to the first Super Bowl. It wasn\u2019t sold out. The tickets were cheap. And if somebody had said, well, 50 years from now, the Super Bowl is going to be the biggest thing on the planet. It would have sounded stupid.\n\u201cThe Aurora Games are named after the Roman goddess of the dawn. And Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. And so I think there are a lot of people who are very, very excited about what we\u2019re doing. And I think that we\u2019ll sort of see how it all goes.\u201d\nDrawing a conclusion as to whether the 2019 Aurora Games was successful is complicated. Criticism of the attendance and venue challenges is fair. So too is Solomon\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d approach.\nUltimately, the six-day festival held this year is a baseline. It is natural for media to question the success of an event by clear-cut metrics like attendance, ticket sales, viewership and profitability. As of now, we only have the attendance numbers.\nIt is worth noting that the 2019 Aurora Games sought to do something that has never been done and they were successful in that. One could measure the volume of attendance, sponsors or salaries for events in one of the six sports to gauge success. However, that is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course, the Olympics is the closest analogue to the Aurora Games, but with a 119-year head start. Not to mention, it includes men and women.\nSolomon sees the Aurora Games as an idea whose time has arrived. Eighteen years ago, he was approached by a group wanted to start a linear 24-hour women\u2019s sports network. Solomon didn\u2019t believe 2001 was the right time, but the idea stuck with him. By 2016, she began to see an opportunity to host a women\u2019s sporting event like none other.\n\u201cI really saw this as, this should be a platform for women athletes that shows what they\u2019re all about, because they\u2019re great. And they\u2019re entertaining. And they\u2019re personable, and they have stories, and their role models \u2026 but they get lost in the comparison to the men and in the bigness of the men,\u201d he said.\nThe \u2018bigness\u2019 Solomon is referring to all revolves around money. The average baseball team, a sport many believe to be struggling to keep fans, is estimated to be worth $1.78bn. Alternatively, an owner could buy a women\u2019s professional softball team for $250,000 and operate a franchise for roughly $1m, according to sports economist David Berri.\nAs of yet, we don\u2019t know if the Aurora Games made a profit or operated at a loss. It is also unclear if Solomon has fully detailed how to measure success of the first-of-its-kind event.\nHowever, the baseline has been set. The Games recruited over 150 athletes, secured over 20 sponsors, and drew an overall crowd of 20,000 fans. With 2019 as a guidepost and with the city of Albany already committed for two more games, Solomon and his team must move the needle.", "label": 0}, "text-164": {"text": "UK citizens\u2019 assembly on climate emergency announced\nA citizens\u2019 assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK\u2019s carbon emissions.\nSix House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday.

Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation; to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,\u201d said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee.\nShe said there needed to be both strong government action and buy-in from the public for the environmental, health and employment benefits that achieving zero emissions could bring to be realised. \u201cI hope the citizens\u2019 assembly will demonstrate that, when all is considered, there is strong public support \u2013 even demand \u2013 for the government to take the action necessary,\u201d she said.\nGreg Clark MP, the secretary of state responsible for climate action, welcomed the citizens\u2019 assembly. \u201cInitiatives to engage the public will be vitally important to appreciating the challenges of getting to net zero and giving people a say in shaping the future policies to achieve the target,\u201d he said.\nBut Roger Hallam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: \u201cWe have a citizens\u2019 assembly that will give recommendations.

But measures such as a diesel tax in France have been seen as unfair.\nExtinction Rebellion mounted large-scale protests in April and young people inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have put further pressure on politicians to act rapidly. The government has already announced that young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the net zero target. Extinction Rebellion is also protesting in the Scottish parliament on Thursday to demand a citizens\u2019 assembly.\nAreeba Hamid, at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe citizens\u2019 assembly shows our politicians are starting to take this major existential threat a bit more seriously, but for it to work, it needs to be more than just a glorified public consultation.

Readers have asked whether they can pause their insurance, particularly as they are set to receive only 80% of their wages. The answer? Unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy. \nInsurers say they set the premium at the start of the policy and the cost reflects the risk at that time. You could try lowering your predicted annual mileage, or take drivers off the policy, but this will rarely achieve big savings \u2013 especially when admin fees of about \u00a330 are applied.\nIf you really need to cut your outgoings, you can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a statutory off road notification (Sorn), and cancelling the insurance. Check the savings and fees before you go ahead. You will also save the car tax for any full months it is off the road.

Users need to apply within eight weeks of their last journey.\nFor season tickets in the rest of the country, passengers have to go back to the train company that sold them the ticket. Operators hope to have a remote system in place soon. Users have eight weeks to apply.\nMost universities have said students will no longer have to pay for halls of residence now they are closed. The fact that many students may not have emptied their rooms is not a barrier.\nUnite, one of the biggest private hall providers, is also waiving charges \u2013 but only if the student says they will not be returning next term. Those not returning must inform it by email by 5pm on 10 April. \nSky and Virgin Media are offering customers the chance to pause sports channels, which typically cost about \u00a330 a month. You have to log on to actively ask for the delay and you will still have access to the channels. Once sports restart, customers will be automatically billed again. BT is offering customers a month\u2019s worth of credit. Again, you have to ask for it \u2013 online.\nGyms mostly shut at the start of the lockdown and have paused memberships accordingly.

Other treatments and surgeries are being delayed to cope with the influx of coronavirus patients.\nThe UK government has promised to cover the cost of any future legal actions by providing indemnities, but the MDU says this could still cost the country vast sums and expose those who have volunteered to \u201cextremely distressing\u201d and potentially career-damaging hearings.\nThe cost of medical negligence in the NHS has climbed steeply in recent years. In 2018, NHS Resolution estimated the accumulated claims it was facing amounted to \u00a383.4bn.\nThe MDU, which is the largest medical defence organisation in the UK, is concerned that a deluge of medical liability lawsuits could be served on healthcare workers long after the memory of their sacrifices and the circumstances of the pandemic has faded.\nWith medical staff taking difficult decisions about patient care in challenging conditions, the MDU wants them to be able to work without fear they will be unfairly judged in the years to come.\nIt accepts that doctors should be accountable for their actions and it is therefore calling for a public debate over legal immunity and whether the NHS should be able to be sued for patient care related to the Covid-19 outbreak. It says any compensation paid out would be a drain on NHS resources and the taxpayer as well as being damaging to staff morale.\nDr Christine Tomkins, the MDU\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur practitioners are being asked to work in conditions that are drastically changed. We have not received any claims yet [related to coronavirus] but we aware of some complaints about treatment of patients.\n\u201cThis could be a very great drain on healthcare resources. It would take money from frontline services. We want to have sensible debate about it. It\u2019s for society to decide whether it\u2019s proper in such wholly exceptional circumstances.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cDoctors are having to work in very difficult circumstances. These are people who, very bravely, are working to the best of their ability. It should not be underestimated how distressing allegations of clinical negligence are for doctors.\n\u201c[Medical negligence] claims are already out of control. Awards are based on 1948 legislation which says that all future care will be [paid for as] private [medical care]. If we keep taking money out of the NHS we reduce its resources. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\u201d \nThe Department of Health has said its emergency clinical negligence indemnity will cover healthcare workers.

The article entitled The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells could better be titled, \u201ccrack open a beer, because the Earth is toast.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s get the obligatory stuff out of the way. Climate change is real, partly man-made, and poses a variety of risks. Depending on how strongly you think the climate is affected by greenhouse gases, where you live, and how well off you are, you could have anything from light concern to serious worry for future generations.\n\nBut rational reactions to climate change\u2014actions that might actually increase society\u2019s resilience to climate variability\u2014are undermined by the endless parade of doom-mongers who exaggerate the risk to the point of absurdity and who insist on completely restructuring society to deal with it.\n\nUninhabitable Earth has been widely read, despite the fact that the article has been discredited as extremist hyperbole, and not simply by the usual people you\u2019d expect (like me), but by 17 establishment climate scientists including the anything-but-skeptical Michael Mann. The article is basically the worst of worst-case scenarios.\n\nBut rather than galvanizing action, this kind of fearmongering generally turns people off. Insisting that worst-case scenarios are the most likely ones, and that the only answer is literally to upend modern technological civilization, leads to the average person just throwing up their hands up and saying \"give me a break.\"\n\nPeople tend to be skeptical of Armageddon for several reasons.\n\nFirst, by the time someone is 25, they\u2019ve probably seen half a dozen doomsday scenarios proposed that didn\u2019t come to pass. Population is growing too fast, we\u2019re all going to starve! The Mayan Calendar ends in 2012 and the Earth will be destroyed. Computers will cease to function after the year 2000 and the world\u2019s technology will shut down, killing millions. If you listen to Paul Ehrlich, Al Gore and Stephen Hawking, we should all be dead a dozen times over by now. Most of us aren\u2019t.\n\nThese claims might \u201cmake bumper stickers great again\u201d but won't (and haven\u2019t for the last 30 years of hysteria) compel the general public to action. The average person just wants a comfortable life. They are not going to believe that doing the things that make for that comfortable life (such as buying a car, buying a house, having a child, having pets, getting health care, educating children, etc.) will ultimately doom humanity to roasting to death in a global conflagration.\n\nSo as I was recently asked on CBC\u2019s On the Money \u201cif the right message on climate change is not \u2018OMG we\u2019re all going to die!\u2019 what should it be?\u201d\n\nAs I mentioned above, climate change is a real thing, just as air pollution is a real thing, but we can manage the risks using conventional policies, conventional engineering and conventional R&D. We do not face imminent catastrophe, and even conventional climate models do not predict serious adverse effects for many decades. Nor do we need to utterly upend human civilization to deal with the risk. Instead, let\u2019s do the small and doable stuff first such as facilitating the natural gas revolution and investing more in the fundamental R&D we need to develop superior energy solutions in the future.\n\nDoomsayers with radical agendas don\u2019t like this rational response to the real risks of climate change because they will not let go of the idea that they can remake humanity by scaring people to death. The last thing they want is to see people taking rational actions such as raising seawalls and coastal highways; fully pricing water to drive diverse sourcing and stability; raising insurance rates in flood- and drought-prone areas; and building more resilient societies by making them wealthier and healthier.\n\nClimate alarmists such as Naomi Klein have always dismissed actions like this as being not only insufficient, but dangerous. They might give people the idea that they can keep their high-tech, consumer-oriented lifestyle without cremating the planet.

This is up from 51% in March.\nJust under half the sample, 43%, believes it is likely bushfires are linked to climate change, and argues it is entirely appropriate to discuss that link during an emergency of the scale we\u2019ve seen around Australia over the past fortnight. When this question was last put to survey respondents in 2013, only 27% of the sample had this view.\nWhile Scott Morrison has accepted the link between climate change and natural disasters, the prime minister has argued \u2013 including in parliament on Monday during a statement on the bushfires \u2013 that it is not appropriate to get into that debate while a disaster is in progress.\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, responded to Morrison\u2019s comments on Monday by arguing Australia does not have the luxury of time to defer important discussions. But Albanese said it was important that public discussion of the issues be \u201csober\u201d and not rancorous.\nVoters most likely to think Australia is not doing enough to deal with the risk of climate change are under 34, and support Labor or the Greens \u2013 although the latest Guardian Essential survey indicates that 46% of Coalition voters in the sample share this view.\nThe poll indicates that 61% of the sample believes that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. That level of support is consistent with readings taken in March this year and October of last year. While that view is supported by 74% of Labor voters in the sample and 89% of Greens voters, it is supported by just under half of Coalition voters, 47%.\nJust over a quarter of the sample (28%) says people aren\u2019t witnessing climate change, they are witnessing a normal fluctuation in the Earth\u2019s climate. Perceptions are different depending on the age of voters. People aged 18-34 are most likely to accept anthropogenic climate change (74%) and voters over 55 are least likely to (50%).\nA separate poll of 25,000 Australians aged 15 to 19, released on Tuesday, shows a sharp rise in concern for the environment and climate change in both cities and regional areas.\nAs part of the 18th annual Mission Australia youth survey, people were asked to name the three most important issues for Australia. Behind mental health, the environment was ranked the second most important issue, chosen by 34% of young people, with more than half of those citing climate change. In 2018, the environment was ranked eighth, nominated by just 9% of young people.\nThe chief executive of Mission Australia, James Toomey, said young people were feeling disenfranchised and this was driving them to find other ways to be heard \u201csuch as climate strikes.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThe growing public dialogue and experience of issues, such as extreme weather events and drought, are clearly affecting young people\u2019s view of the world.\u201d\nEssential said the proportion of people who think it is likely that the bushfires are linked to climate change, but that it is inappropriate to publicly raise this issue during disasters, has remained fairly constant over time. In this fortnight\u2019s poll, 17% of the sample express that view while 14% had that opinion in 2013.\nMorrison defended the Coalition\u2019s record on climate action during question time on Monday. He contended that Australia was in that group of countries which is \u201cbeating, the commitments that we have made to the world, and we will continue to do that\u201d.\n\u201cAustralia is doing its bit when it comes to dealing with climate change,\u201d the prime minister said. But he said the government had no intention of adopting \u201creckless targets supported by the Greens and the Labor party\u201d.\nThe prime minister said it was an \u201coutright lie\u201d to argue that if the Coalition had adopted higher emissions reduction targets then the bushfires would not have happened.\nWhile Australia has committed under the Paris agreement to reduce emissions, pollution has risen consistently since the Coalition repealed the carbon price shortly after winning government in 2013.\nIn an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast last week, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull cut across Morrison\u2019s regular protestations that enough is being done by noting that Australia would struggle to meet its Paris emissions target without rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector.\n\u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nTurnbull also said the Liberal party\u2019s continuing failure to develop a coherent climate and energy policy was costing the country much-needed new investment in power generation.\nThere has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory on 18 May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48.\nThe lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis.\nGuardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues.\nThe poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%.", "label": 0}, "text-172": {"text": "Stop the Punch and Judy politics, Sadiq Khan\nCalling out and isolating extreme voices is part of leadership.

The paper is receiving substantial media attention, but we urge caution before blindly accepting the paper\u2019s assertions.\nAs an initial matter, the authors of the paper are climate modelers. Climate modelers have a vested self-interest in convincing people that climate modeling is accurate and worthy of continued government funding. The fact that the authors are climate modelers does not by itself invalidate the paper\u2019s conclusions, but it should signal a need for careful scrutiny of the authors\u2019 claims.\nCo-author Gavin Schmidt has been one of the most prominent and outspoken persons asserting humans are creating a climate crisis and that immediate government action is needed to combat it. Again, Schmidt\u2019s climate activism does not by itself invalidate the paper\u2019s conclusions, but it should signal a need for careful scrutiny of the authors\u2019 claims.\nThe paper examines predictions made by 17 climate models dating back to 1970. The paper asserts 14 of the 17 were remarkably accurate, with only three having predicted too much warming.\nOne of the paper\u2019s key assertions is that global emissions have risen more slowly than commonly forecast, which the authors claim explains why temperatures are running colder than the models predicted. The authors compensate for this by adjusting the predicted model temperatures downward to reflect fewer-than-expected emissions. Yet fewer-than-expected greenhouse gas emissions undercut the climate crisis narrative.\nThe U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has already reduced its initial projection of 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming per decade to merely 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. Keeping in mind that skeptics have typically predicted approximately 0.1 degree Celsius of warming per decade, the United Nations has conceded skeptics have been at least as close to the truth with their projections as the United Nations. Moreover, global temperatures are likely only rising at a pace of 0.13 degrees Celsius per decade, which is even closer to skeptic predictions.\nEven after the authors adjusted the model predictions to reflect fewer-than-expected greenhouse gas emissions, there remains at least one very important problem, which immediately jumped out at us when carefully examining the paper\u2019s findings: The paper\u2019s assertion of remarkable model accuracy rests on a substantial temperature spike from 2015 through 2017. A strong, temporary El Nino caused the short-term spike in global temperatures from 2015 to 2017. The plotted temperature data in the paper, however, show that temperatures prior to the El Nino spike ran consistently colder than the models\u2019 adjusted predicted temperatures. When the El Nino recedes, as they always do, temperatures will almost certainly resume running colder than the models predicted, even after adjusting for fewer-than-expected greenhouse gas emissions.\nAnother problem with the paper is that it utilizes controversial and dubiously adjusted temperature datasets rather than more reliable ones. The paper relies on temperature datasets that are not replicated in any real-world temperature measurements. Surface temperature measurements and measurements taken by highly precise satellite instruments show significantly less warming than the authors claim. The authors rely on temperature datasets that utilize controversial adjustments to claim more recent warming than what has actually been measured, which further undercuts their claim of remarkable model accuracy.\nContrary to what has been written in many breathless media reports, the most important takeaways from the paper are that greenhouse gas emissions are rising at a more modest pace than predicted, the modest pace of global temperature rise reflects the modest pace of rising emissions, and climate models have consistently predicted too much warming\u2014even after accounting for fewer-than-expected greenhouse gas emissions. A temporary spike in global temperatures reflecting the recent El Nino does not save the models from their consistent inaccuracy.\nJay Lehr, Ph.D., is senior policy advisor for the International Climate Science Coalition.

Just the same, they can enter parliament.\u201d\nLai is part of a group of five young, unorthodox candidates running for legislative seats in Taiwan\u2019s general election on Saturday, in which incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen is seeking reelection against her main opponent, Han Kuo-yu, of the Kuomintang party (KMT). Some like to think of them as the \u201cTaiwanese Squad\u201d, after the four US congresswomen elected in 2018.\nThe election, which sees voters choose their next president as well as their legislative representatives, has implications for regional security, ties with China and the US, as well as the future of the functionally independent country home to 23 million people that Beijing says is an inalienable part of China, despite the fact that the Chinese Communist party has never ruled the island.\nLai\u2019s group \u2013 a coalition known as Democracy frontline, or qianxian, \u201cfrontline\u201d \u2013 includes Freddy Lim, a death metal musician and lawmaker, Enoch Wu, a former special forces officer who was previously an investment banker, Chen Bo-wei, once a movie producer, as well as Hung Tzu-Yung, a marketing executive who got into politics after her army corporal brother died in 2013, causing mass protests over abuses in the military.\nLai was a prominent activist in the 2014 youth-led Sunflower movement against a trade deal with China where she was arrested after chaining herself to other protesters to block traffic. She is also well known for cosplay, dressing up as anime characters.\nThey are popular, often appearing in memes and viral videos, and known for their activism and socially liberal views.\nLev Nachman, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, who focuses on Taiwan, says: \u201cThe biggest thing that makes them similar to the Squad is they are progressive in a way that\u2019s so radically different from what we think of when we imagine what a Taiwanese politician looks like. They are the young progressive faces that a lot of Taiwanese have been looking for.\u201d\nAll five, either independent, third party or members of Tsai\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), are calling for protection of Taiwan\u2019s independence and oppose unification with China, something Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said is \u201cinevitable\u201d, to be achieved by all means necessary, including force.\nLai and her colleagues are part of broader efforts by the DPP, civil society groups and others to mobilise young voters \u2013 a generation sometimes described as tianrandu, the \u201cnaturally independent\u201d born after the mid-1980s and who came of age in a democratic and economically stable Taiwan.\nPrevious generations lived through almost four decades of martial law under the Kuomintang, who fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the communists in 1949, and set up a rival Chinese government. Taiwan had previously been a Japanese colony until 1945. Martial law ended in 1987 and Taiwan has since become one of the most competitive democracies in the region.\nTsai, facing off against Han, the populist plainspoken mayor of Kaohsiung, is depending on younger voters to help repair losses her party suffered in 2018 mid-term elections.\nAfter years of watching surveillance and repression increase in China, including months of police cracking down on protesters in Hong Kong whose one country two systems model is meant to be a model for Taiwan, younger Taiwanese tend to lean toward Tsai. They see her as better able to protect Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, compared with the explicitly pro-China KMT, which advocates for closer economic cooperation and trade.\n\u201cThe role of young people [in this election] is incredibly important,\u201d says Wu Jieh-min, a sociologist at Academica Sinica, noting that Tsai will need them to contest Han. \u201cHan\u2019s supporters are older and their turnout is higher and their intensity is stronger,\u201d he said.\nNew voters between the ages of 20 and 23 make about 6% of Taiwan\u2019s eligible electorate, a proportion large enough to help tip the election for Tsai or secure the hold of pan-green parties, those allied with the DPP, over parliament.\nBut older voters make up the largest voting bloc and voter turnout has traditionally been lowest among younger people. In the 2016 election, average turnout of those between the ages of 20 and 39 was 58%, but 70% for those in their 50s and 74% for those 60 or older, according to data from the Central Election Commission.\nThe Frontline cohort also represents a generation of young Taiwanese who want to move beyond the question of independence to address social issues.\nKevin Zhou, 27, who works in Taipei, says: \u201cMy parents\u2019 generation grew up when the political environment was more restrictive. Having enough to eat was what was important.\n\u201cBut my generation grew up at a stable time. We care about public issues beyond the economy, such as the environment, and gender.\u201d\nFrontline candidates, several of whom have activist backgrounds, have pushed for same-sex marriage, indigenous rights, and reforms aimed at young people such as lowering the voting age from 20 to 18. Freddy Lim has called for more work to investigate abuses during the era of martial law.\nHung Tzu-Yung is running in Taichung and has campaigned on policies to improve air quality and child welfare. Enoch Wu is running in Taipei against the great-grandson of the KMT general and leader Chiang Kai-shek, and has made military reform a key pledge.\nFor Lai, who has called for improved transportation links and elderly care, the point is to align with lawmakers of the same social values in a political landscape where the two main parties are not defined by liberal or conservative policies, so much as by their stance on China and statehood.\n\u201cI belong to the DPP but can this party or every member always have the same values or position as me? Not necessarily, because this is a big party. The good thing about Frontline is that at the very least, the few of us share very similar values. If we are all elected, we can work together and push proposals,\u201d she says. \n\u201cFor so long in political circles, we have not had young people\u2019s voices.

But there have been moments of high drama. In November 1959, for example, the Social Democratic party (SPD) abandoned its historic ambition to replace capitalism with socialism, dropped the Marxist account of class struggle and began to pitch itself as a broad-based Volkspartei (people\u2019s party). History vindicated the decision. For the next 50 years or so, the SPD vied for power with the country\u2019s other great political force, the CDU (and its CSU Bavarian ally), as both parties regularly achieved a vote share of over 40%.\nFamed for their practice of big-tent politics, what the CDU and SPD would give for such numbers now. The agonies of Brexit and the rise of rightwing populism have claimed the political limelight around Europe. But those looking for clues to the continent\u2019s future would do well to watch Germany closely over the coming weeks.\nThe traditional powerhouses, which formed a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d in 2018 to run the country, are each divided and dispirited. A succession of rebuffs in regional elections has led to calls in both parties for more radical and distinct policies. Later this month, in an innovation born of desperation, SPD members will vote in a new leader. They will choose between two joint candidacies, one from the left and one from the right of the movement. To say that there is pressure to get this right would be an understatement. Last month, in state elections in Thuringia, the westernmost of the five former East German regions, the party scored a dire 8.2%, and finished a humiliating fourth. The state was won by the hard-left Die Linke, which has always polled well in the region and on this occasion received almost four times as many votes, its most emphatic win yet. This defeat for the Social Democrats followed a similarly poor result in Saxony, and nationally the SPD is polling at a miserable 15%.\nResults like that in Thuringia point both to Germany\u2019s political fragmentation and to a more general challenge to the country\u2019s economic orthodoxies. The new head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has suggested that Germany should spend more and save less to boost the eurozone economy. One of the four candidates for the SPD leadership, Olaf Scholz, is minister for finance in the coalition government and has reiterated his commitment to the so-called schwarze null (black zero) policy, which commits the country to balanced budgets. But the two leftwing candidates, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, have called for massive investment and an end to the borrowing-averse economics that German politicians have practised since the war. If they are victorious, they are likely to pull the SPD out of the grand coalition and force a snap election.\nMeanwhile, the CDU is conducting its own inquest, having been beaten in Thuringia by the far right nationalists of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). Angela Merkel has already said she will not contest the next federal election, due in 2021. But as the party prepares for its annual congress, which begins in Leipzig on Friday, there is talk of an attempt to block her presumed replacement, the unpopular CDU chair, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Some figures in the party are advocating an end to the ban on pacts with AfD, a terrible move that would significantly shift the centre of gravity on the right of German politics, and represent a definitive break with the liberal immigration policies of Merkel.\nAs has happened elsewhere, the challenges of 21st-century capitalism in western European societies \u2013 low growth, the legacy of deindustrialisation, migration and the fallout from the crash \u2013 have eventually led to a crisis of the political centre. But Germany\u2019s economic pre-eminence means that its response carries a special weight within Europe. Last week, it narrowly avoided going into recession. Its economy remains strong but the boom has ended and German politics will have to respond with more expansionary strategies.

Are they right?\nThe Australian published comments by four Coalition backbenchers suggesting New Zealand\u2019s climate change minister, James Shaw, was a hypocrite for saying there had been an \u201callergic reaction\u201d in the international community to countries wanting to use an accounting measure to meet their 2030 climate target under the Paris agreement.\nThere is no question Shaw was referring to Australia: it is the only country planning to use the measure \u2013 carryover credits claimed for having emitted less than previous self-set targets \u2013 under the Paris agreement.\nThe backbenchers said New Zealand government was itself relying on carryover credits, in this case to meet its 2020 target under the Kyoto protocol.\nThe newspaper followed up with an editorial on Wednesday headed \u201cJacinda Ardern\u2019s climate policy virtue signal exposed\u201d, saying among other things that New Zealand was not on track to meet the 2030 target it lodged in Paris.\nJason Falinski, a moderate from New South Wales, said NZ had shown a \u201clack of consistency and standards\u201d in criticising countries for using the credits. James Paterson, a Victorian senator and former staff member at climate change-denying Institute of Public Affairs, said it was appropriate for Australia to \u201creserve the right to get credit for its success in reducing emissions\u201d.\nThe former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said New Zealand should not be lecturing Australia about environmental policy. Gerard Rennick, a Queensland senator who does not accept mainstream climate science, suggested Australia could reduce its emissions by deporting 600,000 New Zealanders.\nThe Australian editorial adopted the language of the Morrison government, including claiming it was \u201cworking towards\u201d meeting its 2030 target (a 26% to 28% cut below 2005 levels) \u201cwith or without Kyoto carry-over credits\u201d, while New Zealand was forecast to miss its target.\nAt one highly qualified level, yes: New Zealand says it will use 27.7m tonnes of carry-over credits to meet its 2020 target under the Kyoto protocol.\nLike Australia, it \u201cbeat\u201d its target under the first stage of the Kyoto protocol, the precursor to the Paris agreement, which included targets for developed countries up to 2012.\nIt means that, like Australia, it could carry those credits forward and count them against its target for the second stage of the Kyoto deal, which ends this year.\nUnlike Australia, New Zealand would need the credits to meet its 2020 Kyoto target (a 5% cut below 1990 levels). Australia will meet its 2020 target without them.\nNot really. But before we get to that, a couple of caveats.\nFirstly, New Zealand did not actually sign up to the second period of the Kyoto protocol. The former National party government opted not to make its 2020 target legally binding, but said it would still meet the goal using UN rules. Jacinda Ardern has focused on the Paris agreement, including committing the country to net zero emissions by 2050, with a lower target for methane from agriculture.\nSecondly, it is arguable whether Australia is actually meeting its 2020 target. The government usually describes its 2020 target as a 5% cut below 2000 levels. But, according to government projections, national emissions this year will be only 0.3% lower than in 2000.\nThe reason that, despite this, it can still claim to be beating its 2020 target is explained here.\nNew Zealand deserves criticism for not meeting its Kyoto target. But under the most important test \u2013 is what the countries are doing enough? \u2013 both Australia and New Zealand have failed under the Kyoto protocol.\nBoth set inadequate targets based on what scientists say would be their fair share of emissions cuts would be under a meaningful climate deal. Both used creative accounting and loopholes to further limit action.\nNew Zealand is not meeting its low 2020 target and assessments suggest it is not on track to meet its 2030 target (a 30% cut compared with 2005). But it recently passed a zero-carbon act for 2050 and is revising its emissions trading scheme.\nAustralia is meeting its low target using accounting rules, but has not reduced its emissions below what they were 20 years ago. Despite what the government says, it has no evidence it it is on track to meet its 2030 target without using carryover credits. It has no long-term target or, at this point, new policies.\nShaw is not being hypocritical in suggesting Australia shouldn\u2019t use Kyoto carryover credits to meet its 2030 Paris target for one, simple reason: the agreement struck in the French capital is a completely different treaty to Kyoto.\nThe rules of the Kyoto protocol are clear: countries can claim credit against future targets if they beat earlier targets.\nThe Paris agreement does not mention carryover credits, and is legally separate to the Kyoto agreement. Credits from Kyoto have no formal status under it, and New Zealand has no plan to use them its 2030 target.\nThe implied goal of the Paris deal is net zero emissions, which means boosting cuts over time, not finding ways to limit them.\nWhile the Morrison government claims otherwise, Australia\u2019s attempt to use Kyoto credits under Paris has been widely criticised by other countries and remains a point of unresolved disagreement at UN negotiations. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris accord, told the Financial Times: \u201cIf you want this carryover, it is just cheating. Australia was willing, in a way, to destroy the whole system, because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement.\u201d\nShaw\u2019s claim that there has been an \u201callergic reaction\u201d to Australia\u2019s planned reliance on carry over credits might be colourful, but is not hypocritical nor inaccurate. With at least 100 countries signed up to groups that oppose them, it seems a pretty reasonable call.\nBill Hare, from policy and science institute Climate Analytics, puts it more bluntly.\nHe says New Zealand should be applauded for rejecting the use of carryover in the Paris deal, and the hypocrites in this exchange are the Australian politicians who profess to be concerned about climate change while promoting policies, including the use of carryover credits, that will result in higher emissions.", "label": 0}, "text-182": {"text": "Expert quits Home Office drug panel over 'political vetting'\nA criminal justice expert has quit the Home Office\u2019s drug advisory panel, claiming political interference in the appointment process is undermining its independence.\nProf Alex Stevens, a senior member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), resigned over the alleged \u201cpolitical vetting\u201d of panel members by the government.\nThe resignation comes a few months after the crime minister Victoria Atkins vetoed the appointment of Niamh Eastwood, the executive director of the drugs charity Release, after government vetting found she had previously criticised the Home Office and called for drug policy reform.\nStevens said he knew of at least one other person who has been barred from serving on the council after government vetting, amid growing calls for a fundamentally new approach to drug policy.\n\u201cI have resigned because of my concerns over the political vetting of potential members of the ACMD,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese were raised at a meeting in April where I asked for the minister to provide information on how many people had been excluded from serving on the panel.

Eastwood has repeatedly called for legal alternatives to the criminalisation of drug users and the introduction of drug consumption rooms.\nThe Guardian is in contact with two other people who have claimed they were blocked from serving on the ACMD after initially being recommended.\nThe working protocol between the home secretary and the ACMD states: \u201cThe ACMD and ministers are committed to ensuring that the best evidence-based advice is available to government on drug misuse, working together with the common purpose of reducing drug-related harms in the UK.\n\u201cIn doing so, ministers acknowledge the independence of the ACMD and its statutory duties.\u201d\nHowever, the government has been under pressure to adopt an evidence-based approach to drug policy. Drug-related deaths rose to a record 4,359  last year from 1,496 in 2012 and there has been a greater focus on abstinence-based support amid sustained cuts to treatment budgets.\nStevens said the government had ignored the advice of the ACMD on how to reduce the deaths despite accepting a number of recommendations in 2017, eight months after the report he co-authored was published.\nHis analysis of government figures showed a 27% reduction in spending on drug treatment services for adults since 2015-16.\n\u201cThe government accepted the recommendation to maintain investment in opioid-substitute therapy, but it has seen substantial cuts,\u201d Stevens said.\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t resigned because ministers ignore advice, that is their prerogative, but because the ACMD is no longer the independent body it was when I joined it. That means I can no longer be part of the council.\u201d\nSix government drug advisers resigned in protest after Prof David Nutt was famously forced to step down as chair of the ACMD in 2009 after accusing ministers of \u201cdevaluing and distorting\u201d evidence during the reclassification of cannabis as a class B drug, against the advice of the council.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cMinisters are responsible for appointing members to the boards of public bodies and do so in line with the governance code for public appointments.\n\u201cThe names of candidates are submitted to ministers following assessment by an independent advisory assessment panel. It is then for ministers to determine merit and make the final appointment.\n\u201cIt is important that candidates who are considered for these roles undergo appropriate checks to ensure they are suitable to hold these vital public positions\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-183": {"text": "Businesses named on 'A-list' for tackling their climate impact\nSainsbury\u2019s, Lego and H&M are among the businesses to make a prestigious A-list of companies that are deemed to be at the forefront of the charge to tackle the \u201cexistential\u201d climate crisis.\nThe list is compiled by non-profit group CDP which scores companies based on the environmental data they voluntarily disclose on its platform.

Within months, thousands and then millions followed her example.\nSome of the most enthusiastic school strikers have been in Belgium, inadvertently launching a national movement that bridges the country\u2019s entrenched linguistic divide.\nIn the first few months of this year, Belgian teenagers organised 20 weeks of school strikes, events that led to the resignation of a regional environment minister, who had made false claims that the strikes were directed by foreign powers.\nLast month, two of the young women who led the Belgian school strikes embarked on a transatlantic voyage to South America with the initial goal of reaching the UN climate conference in Chile. But events did not go to plan.\nFour weeks into the journey, 36 climate activists from across Europe sailing on the Regina Maris schooner had reached Cape Verde, the island nation off the coast of west Africa, when they heard of Chile\u2019s abrupt decision to cancel hosting the meeting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking news,\u201d wrote Anuna De Wever, one of the founders of the Flanders school strikes, who also voiced \u201cfull support to the people power in Chile\u201d.\nShe and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Charlier, the Francophone voice of Belgium\u2019s school strikes, both aged 18, are the two youngest on board the Regina Maris, which aims to cross the Atlantic by wind power alone. They had hoped to be at the UN meeting \u201cto hold our politicians responsible for their lack of ambition\u201d, De Wever said.\nWith no certainty on where the UN meeting would take place, the group decided to go to South America regardless. The Belgian women wanted to keep a promise to meet South American activists who are working to protect the Amazon. A spokesman for the group said its main aim was unchanged: \u201cPutting the climate impact of aviation on the international agenda.\u201d\nThe day after they left Cape Verde, organisers announced the UN meeting would take place in Madrid.\nThis means the young crew will be on the wrong side of the world just as the meeting is getting under way. Thunberg hopes to get a lift to Madrid, but those on the Regina Maris acknowledge they cannot make it in time. Instead, the activists are rethinking how they will get their message to global leaders in Madrid, as well as putting pressure on domestic politicians.\nBelgium was the second country to undergo the industrial revolution, but its complicated, decentralised politics are hampering efforts to tackle the legacy of coal and steel.\nThe nation of 11.4 million people and six parliaments is on track to miss climate targets in 2020 and 2030, according to the latest progress report from the European commission.\nBelgium has some of the worst traffic jams in Europe, energy-profligate buildings and a saturated railway network.\nThe last straw for Belgian young people came when the environment minister, Marie-Christine Marghem, took a private jet to the 2018 UN climate summit in Katowice, while Belgium declined to join \u201cthe high ambition coalition\u201d \u2013 a group of countries pledging extra efforts to tackle the climate emergency. The text was signed by Belgium\u2019s neighbours, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK.\n\u201cNo, it was not a joke, it was true,\u201d recalled De Wever of Marghem\u2019s flight, in a book about the Flemish school strike movement that she launched with fellow activist Kyra Gantois. \u201cIt was at that point, sitting at the kitchen table, that we looked each other in the eye and said: enough is enough.\u201d\nLaunched by the two young women in Flanders, the strikes soon spread to Francophone regions, making them a rare national movement in a country where the linguistic faultline cuts through political parties, newspapers and television stations.\n\u201cIt is Flemish and French,\u201d De Wever said. \u201cSometimes there are some arguments, especially in politics, but we don\u2019t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us.\u201d\nLeading the movement must have heaped pressure on the young activists. At a recent climate march, Charlier was surrounded by enthusiastic participants asking her to sign their reusable water bottles. De Wever has experienced the ugly side of being in the public eye: she and her friends complained to the police after her tent was ransacked and they were pelted with urine-filled bottles at a music festival this summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot sometimes,\u201d she said, sounding buoyant after thousands turned out to the Brussels gathering of the September global climate strike. \u201cYou get the good and the bad, but at the end of the day, it is all worth it because it is amazing to see so many people coming on the streets, and you get this result,\u201d De Wever said.\nOne of the school strikers\u2019 champions is the Belgian climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He helped the young activists draft a manifesto and said they had succeeded in putting the climate emergency on the agenda. \u201c[The results] are not a full success, but they are not done, their determination to continue is clear,\u201d he said.\nFor now, the school strikers are battling Belgium\u2019s highly decentralised political system. Dave Sinardet, a political science professor at Free University of Brussels, said: \u201cThe federal level is not competent to overrule the regions if they would not reach certain targets.\n\u201cSo instead of having a dynamic where the different regions push each other upwards, they rather have a dynamic where they push each other downwards: everybody is looking at the other one saying, \u2018you should do more\u2019, so that\u2019s clearly a problem.\u201d\nThe political scientist argued the school strikes did not lead to expected gains for climate-action parties at the 2019 elections. While Greens made gains in French-speaking Wallonia and the federal parliament, these were \u201cnot as good as expected\u201d, Sinardet said, while in Flanders, \u201cyou don\u2019t see much climate ambition\u201d.\nIt remains unclear whether Belgium can find a more decisive response to the climate emergency, following election results that left the country more divided than ever. Flanders moved right with gains for the centre-right Flemish nationalists and the far right, while Wallonia swung left, with victory for the Socialists.\nMore than 170 days after the elections in late May, Belgium remains without a federal government, although the country has signed up to an EU plan for net-zero emissions by 2050.\nFor Van Ypersele, a professor at the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, the 2050 target is inadequate. The climate scientist is calling on the EU to reduce emissions to net zero by 2040 to keep global heating below 1.5C, the threshold for avoiding catastrophic climate change.\n\u201cWe are heading on a train which is moving at a 100km an hour towards a wall \u2026 If we only hit the wall when we are travelling at 20km an hour, everyone understands that the damage to the passengers on the train will be infinitely smaller than if we hit the wall at 80km or 60km an hour,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt would be better to get to net zero tomorrow morning [ie in] 2040 rather than 2050.

The leader of the far-right League and Italy\u2019s former deputy prime minister is on trial in the northern city for allegedly defaming the judiciary, but he didn\u2019t show up for the first hearing.\nThe fan club, called I Cinque Sassi (The Five Rocks), emerged in response to the \u201cSardines\u201d, a rapidly proliferating movement against the politics of Salvini and his far-right allies. \u201cThe only fish that interests us is the symbol of the first Christians,\u201d Angela Ciconte, the group\u2019s founder, told reporters outside the court.\nBut they might need more than prayer to effectively compete with the Sardines, who in the last month have packed themselves tightly in ever-increasing numbers into piazzas in city after Italian city.\nHours after the vigil, 35,000 people crammed together like sardines in Turin\u2019s Piazza Castello for the latest demonstration by a movement that sprung up in Bologna in mid-November in reaction to Salvini\u2019s pledge to \u201cliberate\u201d the Emilia-Romagna region from the left in elections in late January.\n\u201cWe are here to say we have had enough of this boorish, vulgar politics cultivated by selfies and fake news,\u201d said Paolo Ranzani, one of the Turin organisers. \u201cBut the left and other political forces are not exempt; politicians need to set an example, right now they\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\nThe Sardines movement began in November after Mattia Santori, 32, from Bologna, sent an urgent message to three friends late at night telling them to meet the next day. It was a couple of days before Salvini and his coalition partners, the smaller far-right party Brothers of Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia, were due to launch their campaign for the Emilia-Romagna regional election at an indoor sports arena in Bologna. Over lunch, the four friends hatched a riposte to Salvini\u2019s boasts about filling Italy\u2019s squares with supporters. The sports arena had a capacity for 5,700 people, and so, via an announcement on Santori\u2019s private Facebook page, the group invited people to a counter-rally at Bologna\u2019s Piazza Maggiore, with the aim of attracting 6,000 people.\n\u201cSalvini and Giorgia Meloni [leader of Brothers of Italy] were announcing themselves as liberators of the region and we wanted to peacefully express our dissent,\u201d said Andrea Garreffa, one of the four friends.\nWhat happened next confounded their expectations: 15,000 people filled the Bologna square. As Salvini\u2019s far-right electoral alliance pursued its campaign, the Sardines converged in other Emilia-Romagna cities before spreading across Italy and beyond. Over 120,000 people are expected to join a national rally in Rome on Saturday.\n\u201cWe feel very moved by what is happening and to see so many people understanding the message that we\u2019re trying to send out,\u201d added Garreffa. \u201cPolitics affects us all and the square is the place to go and discuss and get out of this tunnel vision of social media that divides people instead of building bridges.\u201d\nHolding signs depicting sardines and singing Bella Ciao, the Italian resistance song, the crowd in Turin was made up of a mix of people \u2013 young, old, Italian, foreign, politically engaged or those who have not participated in an election for some time. Their shared aim was to give a strong message against the hate which they say is being cultivated by the far right.\n\u201cWe are fed up with the hateful language and all the racism and we are here to show that there are so many people in Italy who do not think this way,\u201d said Betty Defilippi, 61.\nJuan Puente, a Mexican software programmer who has lived in Turin since 2004, said: \u201cThere is a lot of psychological tension right now and Salvini is polarising, but unfortunately there is no strong political force challenging him.\u201d\nSalvini\u2019s League was ejected from government in August after his failed gambit to collapse a coalition with the Five Star Movement (M5S) and bring about snap elections. His main achievement when in office was to introduce draconian anti-immigration measures, including closing the seaports off to migrants.

While it should have been recognized long ago as an urban myth, one of those stories that hang around regardless of a lack of any supporting facts. Rarely a day goes that a global warming alarmists do not use it to promote their cause of enlarging government and reducing personal freedom through the promotion of fear about our future.\nMany articles have been written to refute this claim but they all dig into the statistical weeds. Common sense alone should set you straight. If the reader wishes he or she read could read the original paper by Naomi Oreskes that started it all in Science Magazine in December of 2004. Be aware you might die laughing.\nThe biased folks who concluded from a truly bizarre survey of science literature that 97% of all authors believe in man caused global warming would have actually been better served had they concluded that 70% of all scientists believe in their premise. That would actually have been possible. However a little common sense should tell us that no large group of people on our planet could ever reach 97% agreement on anything. Yes anything, including the Earth being round rather than flat or the sun rising in the East rather than West, or even the Earth\u2019s gravitational pull.\nSimple proof of this erroneous talking point is provided by the Global Warming Petition Project at the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine in 2015. They obtained signatures on a Declaration from 31,478 American scientists, including 9,021 with Ph.D.s that stated they did not believe man kind had a significant impact on his climate. The declaration included the words: \u201cThere is no convincing scientific evidence that human releases of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases are causing or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth\u2019s climate. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environment of the Earth.\u201d\nThey made all the names available in a paper back book.It is rather doubtful that these people all comprise the 3% of non believers.\nWe do not doubt there are many scientists who do believe that man plays a major role in the determination of his climate. However, among the unsuspecting public who do not stop to consider what we are saying, the near universal comment of \u201cthe 97%\u201d has done a lot of damage. It leads to poor anti fossil fuel legislation in states all across the nation. It leads to some states embracing the Paris Accord which would redistribute $3 trillion of American dollars to nations who use little fossil fuel. These American states could have none but zero impact on the planets thermometer but they can and will damage their state\u2019s economy and their citizens standard of living.\nThe fraudulent 97% consensus is clearly a marketing ploy. What makes science different from religion is that only empirical evidence matters not opinion. Consensus does not matter at all in science.\nIt is not unique in science for incorrect views to hold forth for decades if not centuries before the crowds are turned back by incontrovertible evidence. Medical history is full of the minorities trying to make surgery safer by the simple effort of hand washing. Ulcers were long thought to be a result of type \u201cA\u201d personalities rather than requiring a specific bacteria to allow their development. Einstein himself fought an uphill battle with his theory of relativity.

Not if you can afford it\nBoston has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities.\nNow Boston faces its most existential threat yet \u2013 the rising seas.\nIronically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston\u2019s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise \u2013 in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities.\nThe economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis.\n\u201cIt is an unfortunate quirk of timing,\u201d admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site.\nCity authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 \u2013 a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston.\nThe seeds of Boston\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston\u2019s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands.\nThe core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline \u2013 a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world\u2019s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, according to the World Bank.\nThe sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide.\nDevelopers in Boston are attempting to stare down this challenge, however. Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated.\nBut Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it \u2013 an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor\u2019s first \u201cliving shoreline\u201d \u2013 a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides.\nYou get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor.\nSeawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,\u201d Iselin said. \u201cIn four or five years you\u2019ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape.\n\u201cI think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it\u2019s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.\u201d\nThe developers haven\u2019t left too much to chance \u2013 Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator.\nThese adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible.\nA more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m.\nThese new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the \u201cperception of gentrification is very real\u201d, Iselin conceded.\nBoston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis \u2013 its Climate Ready Boston plan sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms \u2013 but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements.\nThe city has had one near miss \u2013 Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won\u2019t be so lucky next time.\n\u201cWhere I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient \u2013 all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,\u201d said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group the Harborkeepers who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. \u201cThe question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?\u201d\nOriginally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston\u2019s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston\u2019s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries.\n\u201cBoston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants \u2013 Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,\u201d Ayed said. \u201cThat\u2019s still the case but it\u2019s changing. I don\u2019t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can\u2019t. I probably won\u2019t be able to ever afford it.\u201d\nAyed said that Lendlease \u201cdeserves a lot of credit\u201d for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she\u2019s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt.\n\u201cThe bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,\u201d Ayed said. \u201cThe whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.\u201d\nBoston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn\u2019t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city\u2019s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved.\nThe task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America\u2019s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground.\n\u201cAs we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,\u201d said Christopher Cook, Boston\u2019s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them.\n\u201cSuccess is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can\u2019t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won\u2019t have been successful.\u201d\nEven for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this?\nBig cities like Boston can muddle through a lot of these questions themselves but the vast US coastline faces a hopefully mismatched response to the swelling seas. There is no overarching federal government strategy to deal with sea level rise, a phenomena that\u2019s on course to displace an astounding 13 million Americans, according to a University of Georgia in Athens study, with the Trump administration dismantling the few federal requirements to build with the climate crisis in mind.\n\u201cThe challenge is enormous, so much so that it could be paralyzing,\u201d said Cook. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken on challenges over time, though, and this is just the next stage in this.\n\u201cBut we do need strong federal leadership \u2013 frankly we needed it 10 years ago. Washington DC needs to focus on protecting coastal cities, because a lot of them don\u2019t have the flexibility we do.\u201d\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Interestingly, it appears Bosa made the changes to his social media specifically because he is going to a city considered a liberal haven. \u201cI had to,\u201d Bosa told ESPN in a story published this month about his deleted posts. \u201cThere is a chance I might end up in San Francisco.\u201d\nThe first thing that should be said is that Bosa shouldn\u2019t just scrub those likes of posts involving homophobia and the n-word: he should apologise and renounce bigotry. As for his other posts on Trump and Kaepernick: he is perfectly entitled to his political views. Which raises an interesting question: how should players balance their marketability with their off-field opinions? There is no right or wrong answer. It depends on your perspective, your priorities.Colin Kaepernick took a knee knowing he could be ostracised from the NFL. But giving his community a voice was more important to him than slinging footballs, no matter how much he loved his job. Bosa\u2019s priorities appear different. The younger brother of Charger All-Pro Joey, and son of John, an ex-NFL pro with the Dolphins, Nick\u2019s family is well versed in the business of football and its commercial impact. His decision makes financial sense. But his lack of conviction is jarring. Whether you agree or disagree with Bosa\u2019s politics is beside the point. If he truly believed, like really believed in these causes and views, he would use that to promote his message, the way Chris Long, Michael Bennett and Kaepernick have done. San Francisco is liberal, sure. Maybe you distance yourself from some folks in the locker room. Maybe some of the Niners\u2019 more liberal base grabs a Garoppolo jersey instead of a Bosa one. But you show conviction, not timidity. Rational people can respect that.Besides, the reality of sports is this: winning cures all and most fans \u2013 and teammates \u2013 have an ability to avert their gaze as long as the sacks and pressures and W\u2019s are flowing. It\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s the truth. As long as Bosa is devouring quarterbacks, it won\u2019t matter if he\u2019s battling a cocaine addiction or getting a DUI with a stack of guns and a child in the car. Dallas fans still cheered for Greg Hardy despite a domestic violence incident that included throwing a woman onto a bed of guns. Fans and other players will wince at those headlines. Then go back to rooting for the name on the front of the jersey, ignoring the sins of the name on its back.By comparison, questionable social media activity is small potatoes. And here\u2019s the other thing: just because the tweets and likes are deleted, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gone for good. Screen grabs and memories live on. If a Niners fan has already checked out on Bosa due to their support for Kaepernick or their political leanings, deleting tweets will not change their mind. And you can bet they\u2019ll still let out the slightest of fist pumps when Bosa drops Jameis Winston in week one. For some \u2013 like Kaepernick \u2013 having your voice heard is more important than the extra dollars from a sponsorship deal or jersey sales. For Bosa, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not. \nNote: these are the most talented players available, not a prediction of the order in which they will be picked. \n1) Nick Bosa, edge, Ohio State\nQuestionable social media strategy aside, Bosa is widely considered the best player in this year\u2019s draft class on either side of the ball. Bosa missed most of this junior year after undergoing a core-muscle surgery. Yet his place atop draft boards was already assured thanks to a dominant sophomore campaign, in which he had the highest \u201cpass rush wins\u201d percentage in all of college football. Bosa finished the season with 25 hurries, 15 hits, nine sacks and three batted passes. It was a non-stop highlight package. Bosa will be really, really good, really, really fast. No one is a can\u2019t-miss prospect, but Bosa is about as close as you can get.\n2) Quinnen Williams, defensive line, Alabama\nPass rushers and pass blockers, that\u2019s what this draft is all about. Either get someone who can hit the other team\u2019s quarterback or grab someone who can protect your guy. Watch Williams play, and you will instantly be awed by the sheer spectacle of someone so big being able to move so fast. He is damn-near unstoppable off the snap. Talent wise, he would be a top-five pick in any year.\n3) Josh Allen, edge, Kentucky\nYes, Allen is an excellent pass rusher. But he\u2019s so much more than that. He is a defensive chess piece who drifts between a bunch of different positions and makes plays all over the field. He has a turbocharged get-off and has been compared to Chicago\u2019s Khalil Mack.\n4) Ed Oliver, defensive line, Houston\nIf you listen hard enough, you can hear the sound of 32 NFL defensive coordinators cajoling their general manager to find any way possible to grab Oliver in the upcoming draft.\nThanks to the dominance of Aaron Donald, small, twitchy, defensive linemen are all the range. The 287lbs Oliver is still considered small by the Donald-standard. He was even asked to perform linebacker drills by the Titans at this year\u2019s combine. \u201cI\u2019d ask myself to play linebacker too,\u201d Oliver said at the time. He will play inside, outside, and stood up on Sundays. And he will be a potent force for years to come.\n5) Kyler Murray, quarterback, Oklahoma\nThe likely No1 pick is the most electric player in the draft, regardless of position. He is the only quarterback in 20 years who comes close to matching the athleticism of Michael Vick. In the right offense, he can be a special weapon.\nTwo of the major concerns about Murray have been answered: his commitment; his slender frame. He spurned baseball to concentrate on being a quarterback full-time and he turned heads at the combine turning up at a bulked up 207lbs.\nThere\u2019s no disputing his on-field performance or production. He wasn\u2019t as methodically brilliant as Baker Mayfield at Oklahoma but his highs were just as high \u2013 \u201cwow\u201d throws delivered from the most bonkers of body positions; game-breaking runs. Someone will take him first overall.

Although there are undoubtedly many issues stoking the protests and sometimes violent riots on the streets of Santiago, Chile and other Chilean cities and towns, even the liberal Washington Post acknowledges the spark that ignited the public\u2019s passions, driving them to take to the streets, was the government\u2019s decision to curry favor with Western governments and international agencies by pushing expensive energy restrictions to fight purported climate change.\nThe article in the Post states,\n[T]he catalyst [behind the protests] was a proposal to raise public transport fares and energy bills. There is ample evidence from across the world that these will incite rebellion like nothing else\u2014a point that those who hope to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions via a carbon tax should bear in mind. The violent protests of the Gilets Jaunes in France were over higher gasoline taxes, which were seen as penalizing car-dependent people in the provinces while favoring metropolitan elites. Mexico in 2017 saw riots and protests against what was known as the \u201cgasolinazo,\u201d a 20 percent rise in fuel prices that was a part of the government\u2019s partial privatization of Pemex, the monopoly state oil company. Last year, Brazil was rocked by protests and a strike by truck drivers in response to fuel shortages and a sharp increase in the price of diesel.\nIn a May issue of Climate Change Weekly, months before Chile began to burn and the Washington Post took notice, I noted climate politics in the United States and abroad had turned decidedly skeptical in recent years.\nIn the United States in 2016, voters elected a noted climate skeptic, Donald Trump, as president of the United States. In very short order, he kept his campaign commitment to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. In progressive Washington State, voters in 2016 and again in 2018 directly rejected referenda that would have imposed taxes on carbon dioxide to fight climate change, and in Colorado voters rejected an initiative which would have imposed new restrictions on oil and gas production.\nAbroad, starting perhaps with the French yellow vest protests, energy-restricting climate policies and the political parties supporting them have also been taking a beating, sometimes on the streets, certainly at the polls. As I wrote in May, \u201cFrom Alberta to Australia, from Finland to France and beyond, voters are increasingly showing their displeasure with expensive energy policies imposed by politicians in an inane effort to fight purported human-caused climate change.\u201d For example, months of sometimes violent protests forced the French government to rescind its stated plans to impose higher taxes on gasoline and electric power to pay for its climate policies, and Australia\u2019s prime minister was forced to resign after energy prices rose and electric power blackouts occurred as a result of the country\u2019s climate policies. New political parties arose, running explicitly on platforms embracing anthropogenic climate change skepticism and supporting the continued used of fossil fuels, and promptly won seats in parliaments in the Netherlands and Finland.\nThat brings us to Chile, where, despite relatively low coal, natural gas, and oil prices,\u2014prices that have fallen significantly over the past decade\u2014the government hiked fares on public transit and electric power fees across the nation to pay for a forced transition away from inexpensive fossil fuels to expensive, less reliable renewable energy. Chile\u2019s energy price hikes came after the government volunteered to host the next round of U.N. climate meetings and treaty negotiations when Brazil, under its recently elected climate realist government, backed out of hosting the international climate summit.\nChilean President Sebastian Pinera\u2019s green virtue-signaling came at a high cost to the public, and now a high cost to his government as well. In response to the riots and persistent protests, Chile has been forced to put troops on the streets and cancelled its plans to host the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), scheduled for December 2. This leaves the UNFCCC scrambling to find a new host government and city on very short notice for such a meeting, considering the thousands of climate diplomats, bureaucrats, and nongovernmental organization representatives who attend such meetings.\nBecause I can say it no better, I leave you with my Heartland Institute colleague James Taylor\u2019s comments on the lessons to be learned from Chile\u2019s riots over energy price hikes:\nClimate activists and the United Nations are suffering a major black eye this week as protests and riots resulting from high energy prices have erupted in Santiago, Chile.\nThe Chilean protests, like the Yellow Vest protests that erupted in France a year ago, highlight how out of touch the international climate class is with the people they seek to govern and control. Faced with a choice between suffering certain lower living standards today or dealing with speculative climate change in the distant future, people wisely choose the latter.\nThat will continue to be the case until predicted climate harms actually materialize \u20acand negatively affect people, or until wind and solar power can economically compete with conventional energy. So far, neither has been the case.\n\u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 H. Sterling Burnett\nSOURCES: Climate Change Weekly; Climate Change News; Epoch Times; Washington Post\nIN THIS ISSUE \u2026\nFarming is changing the weather in corn country \u2026 Urbanization leads to heavy rains in China\nThe journal Science is reporting on a new study in the journal Geographical Research Letters which concludes farming in the corn belt of the central United States, stretching from the panhandle of Texas up to North Dakota and east to Ohio, is actually changing the climate there, with summer temperatures falling by as much as a degree and rainfall increasing by up to 35 percent, a larger spike than anywhere else in the world. During this climate shift, the amount of corn harvested in this region annually has increased by 400 percent since 1950, from two billion to 10 billion bushels.\nTo determine whether corn farming could be affecting the decline in temperatures and increase in rainfall across the region, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used computers to model five different 30-year climate simulations, comparing \u201csimulations with high levels of intense agriculture to control simulations with no agricultural influence. Unlike the real-life climate changes, the control simulations showed no change in temperature or rainfall. But 62 percent of the simulations with intense agriculture resulted in temperature and rainfall changes that mirror the observed changes.\u201d\nThe MIT researchers then compared these results to historical simulations from computer models operated by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), counting greenhouse gas emissions and other natural and human influences as forcing mechanisms for climate change, but not accounting for changes in agricultural activity. WCRP\u2019s models failed to accurately portray the climate changes in the U.S. corn belt, projecting temperatures there should have increased, rather than falling, and rainfall should have increased much more modestly (4 percent) than has actually occurred (35 percent). After the MIT team ruled out other possible factors, it concluded it was highly likely farming itself is changing the climate on the Great Plains.\nThe MIT team speculates increased water vapor across the region comes from improved photosynthesis, as plants taking in more carbon dioxide also release more water through their stoma. Another factor could be the increased use of large-scale irrigation.\n\u201c\u2018The [influence] of agriculture intensification is really an independent problem from greenhouse gas emissions,\u2019 says Ross Alter, lead author of the study, \u2026 a meteorologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\u201d reports Science. \u201cIn fact, Alter says, heavy agriculture likely counteracted rising temperatures regionally that might have otherwise resulted from increasing greenhouse gas emissions. One other place that shows a similar drop in temperatures, he notes, is eastern China, where intensive agriculture is widespread.\u201d\nThis is the first time researchers have directly compared the influence of greenhouse gas emissions to agricultural activities to account for regional climate changes across the central United States, Nathan Mueller, an earth systems scientist at the University of California, Irvine, told Science.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how agricultural activity can have \u2018surprisingly strong\u2019 impacts on climate change,\u201d Muller said. \u201cFood production is arguably what we\u2019re more concerned about with climate change, [thus] [i]t\u2019s not just greenhouse gases that we need to be thinking about,\u201d said Mueller, because understanding the complex interaction between agriculture and climate is, and will continue to be, critical to anticipating future climate changes and crop yields.\nSOURCE: Science\nA recent study in the journal Asian Agricultural Research finds urbanization is the primary factor in the increased amount of precipitation, especially precipitation coming during extreme weather incidents, across China. The study examined \u201cdaily torrential rain observations from 659 meteorological stations in China from 1951 to 2010\u201d and found rapid urbanization likely \u201ctriggered a significant increase in heavy rains in China.\u201d\n\u201cChina\u2019s county-level population and annual average of visibility days were significantly correlated with China\u2019s interdecadal heavy rainfall amount, rainy days, and rain intensity,\u201d the study states.\n\u201cChina\u2019s interdecadal heavy rainfall amount, rainy days, and rain intensity increased significantly, with an increase of 68.71 percent, 60.15 percent, and 11.52 percent, respectively. Rapid urbanization factors, including secondary industry output, urban population ratio, annual average haze days, are likely to be the main causes of the increase in heavy rains in China,\u201d the study concluded, based on the distribution and timing of extreme rainfall events when compared to the distribution and timing of urbanization, attendant densification, and the increase in air pollution from industrialization.\nOther, lesser factors influencing extreme precipitation events, based on their less direct correlation to the intensity, number, and pattern of extreme precipitation events, include variable natural climate factors such as the West Pacific Subtropical High, the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Interdecadal Oscillation, and the Antarctic Oscillation. The study\u2019s author concluded climatic factors had only one-third as much effect in driving extreme precipitation events as urbanization.\nSOURCE: WuChu (USA - China) Science & Culture Media Corporation (from abstract, article behind paywall)", "label": 1}, "text-198": {"text": "Break in the cricket season offers chance to consider future of the sport\nThe most popular book in the makeshift library at the Tarsao prisoner of war camp was a bible, the second a copy of the 1939 Wisden Almanack. It belonged to Jim Swanton and so many people wanted to borrow it that he\u2019d only lend it for six hours at a time.\nHe had carried the book with him from Britain, through Nova Scotia and South Africa, to Singapore, where he was captured by the Japanese. Swanton repaired it over and again, bound it with rice paste and recovered it with rubber. He used it to invent pretend radio commentaries for the other internees and as the basis for a lecture on \u201cThe Life of Bradman\u201d.\nLost in Wisden, Swanton wrote, \u201cour minds were strangely at peace\u201d. There wasn\u2019t any first-class cricket being played, even if they had had a way to follow it, but there was solace in the thought of the game, in the memory of what it had been before it all started and the promise of what it would be once it was all over. During the English summer the County Championship runs like a clock, the tick-tock of runs and wickets unbroken through the season. You notice it most when it\u2019s stopped.\nIn that \u201939 Wisden, among the reports of Len Hutton\u2019s 364 against Australia at the Oval, an obituary of Lord Hawke and a tribute to Frank Woolley, there\u2019s an article by Bradman, which he called Cricket at the Crossroads. \u201cNo matter how much we love cricket,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe cannot possibly disassociate its future from the cold, hard facts of finance. Nor can we blind ourselves to the fact that at this very moment public support for cricket suggests either that cricket is becoming less attractive or other forms of entertainment are gaining ground.\n\u201cWith the quickening of modern tempo, the more Americanised trend which is demanding speed, action and entertainment value, it behoves all of us to realise we are the custodians of the welfare of cricket and must guard its future even more zealously than its present.\u201d Bradman argued for better pitches, a change to the lbw law, and more modern scoreboards. \u201cI am quite sure the administrators of England and Australia are more closely united now than ever before. To me, therefore, it seems an appropriate time to try and achieve a greater measure of uniformity of opinion.\u201d\nBradman\u2019s words echo in both directions. You find similar when the County Championship was suspended for the first time, in 1914, and they still sound familiar now when it has been suspended again, for the first time since its postwar resumption in 1946. Either cricket mirrors life so closely that its crises are synchronised with everyone else\u2019s or it is a game in perpetual ill health. But either way, on both previous occasions when play stopped in the County Championship, the break was used as an opportunity to debate what was wrong with the game and how best to try to fix it.\nDuring the first world war the game was in a fret, again, about its waning popularity with the public, worried that its slow tempo was out of touch with the fast times. \u201cIt occurred to some peculiar people that cricket stood in need of drastic alterations,\u201d the Wisden editor, Sydney Pardon, wrote in 1919. So the authorities decided to cut county matches down to two days and play longer each day. They considered scrapping the tea break, shortening boundaries and penalising the batting side for maiden overs. The Times even floated a plan to ban left-handers to save time altering the field between deliveries.\nPardon felt the authorities blundered by tinkering too much. The two-day matches were scrapped the following season, when games were played over the old length of three days. \u201cI trust,\u201d he wrote in that year\u2019s Wisden, \u201cwe shall hear no more about the need for drastic alterations in the game.\u201d His trust was misplaced. By 1939, the game was going through it all over again.\nDuring the war years, large crowds had turned out for exhibition one-day games at Lord\u2019s. Sir Home Gordon wrote: \u201cOne wartime development is that spectators have become thrilled over close finishes.\u201d There was a drive, in the mid-1940s, to introduce a one-day knockout cup, to be played on Sundays, to scrap the distinction between amateurs and professionals \u2013 all proposals that would come to pass, decades later, but were rejected at the time by authorities who, Swanton wrote, \u201ccondemned without hesitation all proposals to tamper with the fundamentals of the game\u201d.\nThey wanted also to cut county matches back from three days to two, but that plan was rejected as well. This time they erred the other way and the upshot was that they postponed reform so long they ended up performing emergency surgery on the game in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nAnd in 2020 the game is in the throes of a similar debate, as it weighs the competing needs of 18 counties and four separate formats. The most recent of these, the Hundred, is wildly unpopular with a lot of the people who love the others. Its few supporters argue, however, that it is the best way to sustain cricket in the long term. The ECB has said economic necessity dictates it will prioritise the T20 Blast if and when play resumes this summer, with the Hundred in the balance.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s the bigger question of how it all fits together, of what it is we\u2019re all pining for here: the game as it was or the game as we want it to be? This break is one last opportunity to ask whether the sport really wants to press on with these radical changes or reconsider them altogether.", "label": 0}, "text-199": {"text": "Sajid Javid resigns as chancellor in Boris Johnson reshuffle\nSajid Javid has resigned as chancellor after Boris Johnson asked him to sack all of his advisers in a move by No 10 to seize control of the Treasury.\nJavid has been replaced by his deputy, Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who is a favourite within No 10.\nJavid, who had been in post since last summer, repeatedly clashed with Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, over issues such as restraints on spending.\nSpeaking outside his home, Javid told reporters he was asked to replace all of his political advisers to stay on in the role. He said: \u201cI was unable to accept those conditions and I do not believe any self-respecting minister would accept those conditions.\u201d\nWhen asked whether the conditions were put forward by Cummings, hesaid they were imposed \u201cby the prime minister\u201d. He added: \u201cMy successor has my full support as does the prime minister.\u201d\nJavid\u2019s resignation letter to Johnson contained a number of parting shots at the No 10 operation led by Cummings. It included a plea for the Treasury to retain its credibility, and a warning that leaders needed to have \u201ctrusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with\u201d.\nThe letter, which Javid posted on Twitter, also stressed the importance of having people around a prime minister that can give \u201cclear and candid advice\u201d.\nIt has been a privilege to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Sunak will now take on that responsibility despite having entered parliament less than five years ago.\nJohnson sprang the changes on Javid with no warning, leaving the chancellor and his staff shocked. He had proposed that Javid get rid of all his political staff and allow No 10 to create a joint unit pooling special advisers with Johnson.\nDowning Street sources suggested the \u201cspad unit\u201d was a way of minimising friction between Numbers 10 and 11, and avoiding the kind of tensions that hampered the Blair government.\n\u201cYou either go the Blair and Brown way, or you do the George and Dave way,\u201d said a source \u2013 referring to the close relationship between George Osborne and David Cameron, who shared an office in opposition, and took the same approach into government in 2010.\nIt is understood Javid was told most of his current team of advisers would not be considered for roles in the new team, because No 10 believed they had not served him well, and had given him poor advice.\nNo 10 officials were particularly irritated by what they regarded as a ham-fisted briefing about the HS2 decision, that appeared to play up Javid\u2019s role in approving the project, and pre-empted an official announcement by the prime minister.\nDowning Street suggested Sunak, as well as other Johnson favourites Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden, were the kind of unshowy, \u201cdelivery-focused\u201d ministers the PM wanted to reward. \nLabour\u2019s John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Javid\u2019s resignation showed that Cummings had \u201cclearly won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury and install his stooge as chancellor\u201d.\n\u201cThis must be a historical record, with the government in crisis after just over two months in power,\u201d he said.\nThere have been bad relations between No 10 and No 11 since Cummings fired Javid\u2019s press secretary, Sonia Khan, in August without consulting him after alleging she was responsible for leaks, which she denied. She had refused to hand over her phone and security escorted her out of the building.\nSince then, there have been rows between No 10 and Javid\u2019s team over the Conservatives\u2019 economic policy at the election and the contents of the budget. Javid had been pushing for tighter fiscal rules, while No 10 wanted fewer constraints on spending.\nNo 10 had always insisted that relations between Javid and Johnson were personally fine, with the prime minister attending the chancellor\u2019s 50th birthday party along with his partner, Carrie Symonds, a former adviser to Javid.\nHowever, tensions have been simmering for months at adviser level, and the longstanding rows ultimately ended in No 10\u2019s attempt to seize political control over the direction of the Treasury.\nThe other big surprise in the reshuffle was the sacking of Julian Smith as Northern Ireland secretary little over a month after he oversaw the restoration of its devolved assembly and amid a potentially perilous time for the region.\nThe nationalist SDLP said it showed \u201cJohnson\u2019s dangerous indifference to us\u201d, while the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, called Smith \u201cone of Britain\u2019s finest politicians of our time\u201d.\nOther cabinet departures include Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary.\nLeadsom was replaced by the international development secretary, Alok Sharma, who was also made minister responsible for the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a defence minister, was promoted to development secretary in his place.\nOliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office office minister, was sent to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to replace Nicky Morgan, who continued in the job temporarily as a peer after stepping down at the election.\nCox tweeted a letter to Johnson, praising his delivery of Brexit. Villiers posted a Facebook message confirming her departure, beginning: \u201cWhat the prime minister giveth, the prime minister taketh away.\u201d\nOne surprise was the sacking of Nusrat Ghani as a junior transport minister. Ghani had been tipped to become the new minister for HS2. She was one of two junior transport ministers sacked. \u201cOn my bike,\u201d tweeted the other, George Freeman.\nEsther McVey was also removed as housing minister and Chris Skidmore as universities minister, adding to the churn in two roles with a recent history of high ministerial turnover.\nSuella Braverman, a former Brexiter minister who resigned over May\u2019s deal, has been appointed attorney general.

Nigeria\u2019s creative industry is worth billions of dollars and provides jobs for thousands. Starting with poverty statistics forces the reader to draw conclusions about Nigeria before they have even begun, telegraphing that their response should be one of pity.\nNevertheless, I turn the page and meet Adunni, our protagonist. Adunni is a 14-year-old girl who lives in a small town several hours\u2019 drive from Lagos. Although she is a minor, she is about to be illegally married off to raise money for her father. Her bride price will be used to pay the family\u2019s rent, among other things. In many ways, her tale is one of woe. Her mother, who championed her right to an education, is dead. She is raped by her \u201chusband\u201d, who has a daughter her age. Through a series of unfortunate events, she ends up in Lagos as the servant of Big Madam. Although called a \u201chouse-girl\u201d, she is really a slave because her wages are withheld from her and given to her procurer.\nDespite her hardships, Adunni is determined to become a success, and believes that the surest route is by securing a western education. This is a trope used in classic Nigerian children\u2019s books such as Onuora Nzekwu\u2019s Eze Goes to School, and is deployed to good effect here. The reader is given a reason to root for Adunni as through the ups and downs of her journey she rarely loses sight of her ultimate goal of becoming a girl with a \u201clouding voice\u201d.\nThis book joins a long tradition of issue-led novels that have sparked conversations resulting in social change\nWhat is a louding voice? It appears to be a coinage of Dar\u00e9\u2019s for a young woman who confidently shares her perspective on the world, backed up by a sound western education. Dar\u00e9 has said of the language in which the book is written: \u201cNigerians speak something called pidgin English, and I knew I didn\u2019t want to write in pidgin English because even the very educated people speak pidgin English. I wanted it to be nonstandard English. I could make it Adunni\u2019s. It could be her own English, so to speak.\u201d\nThe results of this invented English are uneven. Sometimes it yields original and humorous imagery: Big Madam has a \u201cchest wide like blackboard\u201d. At other times, Adunni\u2019s mangled dialect seems to turn her into an object of fun, both to the reader and also to the book\u2019s other characters, as though she is the butt of a joke she is not aware of.\nThe narrative is written in the first person. The reader is privy to Adunni\u2019s thoughts and one wonders why she needs to invent a language to think in when she already has one in which she is fluent: throughout the novel she sings in Yoruba and at one point even acts as a Yoruba translator. Why couldn\u2019t Adunni\u2019s interior life be translated from fluent Yoruba into fluent English?\nThe novel is strongest when dealing with interpersonal relationships, especially between characters of different classes. Kofi, Big Madam\u2019s cook, takes Adunni under his wing. He cowers in front of Big Madam but bosses Adunni around. Adunni also forms a friendship with Tia, a wealthy environmental consultant and doctor\u2019s wife who lives nearby. Tia is privileged and well educated, but naive about the harsh realities of Adunni\u2019s life. Their friendship, in which they exchange knowledge, is one of the highlights of the book.\nThe story told in this novel is an important one. The trauma of girls forced into marriage and the blight of domestic slavery in Nigeria are both issues that must be brought to light. As Adunni wonders: \u201cWhy are the women in Nigeria seem to be suffering for everything more than the men?\u201d The Girl With the Louding Voice joins a long and fine tradition of issue-led novels that have sparked conversations resulting in social change. Social justice is a laudable intention when writing a novel, yet one also reads them for subtler and less concrete gains.\n\u2022 Chibundu Onuzo\u2019s Welcome to Lagos is published by Faber.

Multiple lines of evidence show the climate is much less sensitive to additional inputs of greenhouse gases than CSSR\u2019s authors assume. Lehr\u2019s team demonstrates CSSR\u2019s report downplays our inadequate understanding of the role clouds, oceanic cycles, and solar cycles play in climate change. In addition, the climate projections used by CSSR rely on unproven assumptions about various feedback mechanisms kicking in to spike temperatures, while ignoring the fact the claimed feedbacks have not been shown to be active in the real world but are only climate model assumptions.\nThe climate models CSSR uses have proven faulty time and again. The climate models fail to reflect actual temperatures. They have predicted much more warming than the earth has experienced, and they failed to reflect the recent 18-year pause in temperature increases. In addition, CSSR can produce no solid data confirming climate model projections of declining ice cover in Antarctica, nor for worsening hurricanes, droughts, and floods. In short, as The Heartland Institute\u2019s taskforce reports shows, CSSR places too much faith in computer models while neglecting to apply the scientific method.\nIn addition to providing a detailed critique of the misstatements in the CSSR, The Heartland Institute\u2019s report discusses basic facts about the role of carbon dioxide in climate change which are completely ignored in CSSR, and it shows the earth has been warmer in the past and coastlines are not facing runaway rising sea levels.\nOne could find no better summary of the numerous flaws and outright falsehoods contained in the Obama administration\u2019s parting climate scare story, the CSSR, than this report from The Heartland Institute. I recommend reading it in full.\n\u2014 H. Sterling Burnett\nSOURCE:\u00a0The Heartland Institute\nClimate change is not a catastrophe ...\u00a0Countries falling short of Paris climate commitments \u00a0...\u00a0NOAA caught manipulating data again\nCLIMATE CHANGE NOT A CATASTROPHE\nRecent articles in\u00a0Scientific American\u00a0and elsewhere acknowledge what many climate realists have long said: climate change, whether human-caused or not, does not mean the end of human civilization or life on Earth. Instead, human life is getting better. In one essay, journalist Will Boisvert argues the climate influence of human greenhouse gas emissions isn\u2019t catastrophic, writing:\nHow bad will climate change be? Not very. \u2026 While the climate upheaval will be large, the consequences for human well-being will be small. Looked at in the broader context of economic development, climate change will barely slow our progress in the effort to raise living standards.\nAmong the evidence Boisvert cites to prove his case is a\u00a0Lancet\u00a0study released in 2016 which the mainstream media portrayed as showing climate change would cause food shortages leading to 529,000 deaths each year from malnutrition and related diseases. What the study really showed is,\n\u2026 in 2050 the world will be better fed than ever before. \u2026 [F]ood will be more abundant than now thanks to advances in agricultural productivity that will dwarf the effects of climate change, ... rais[ing] per-capita food availability to 3,107 kilocalories per day, \u2026 substantially higher than the benchmarked 2010 level of 2,817 kilocalories\u2014and for a much larger global population. The poorest countries will benefit most, with food availability rising 14 percent in Africa and Southeast Asia. [T]he study estimates that improved diets will save a net 1,348,000 lives per year in 2050.\nIn addition, Boisvert notes environmentalists link Syria\u2019s civil war to the drought experienced in the region from 2006 through 2010, citing it as a harbinger of climate crises to come. Yet Israel suffered the same drought but overcame it, without a civil war, Boisvert points out. Technological breakthroughs in desalination allowed the country to reduce the energy needed to desalinate sea water by 50 percent, dramatically lowering the cost of doing so, with the result being \u201cIsrael\u2019s water situation U-turned from worsening scarcity to sufficiency.\u201d\nA separate article in\u00a0Scientific American\u00a0discusses Harvard scientist Steven Pinker\u2019s efforts to get environmentalists to admit the tremendous benefits delivered by modern technologies using fossil fuels.\n\u201c[I]ndustrialization has been good for humanity. It has fed billions, doubled lifespans, slashed extreme poverty, and, by replacing muscle with machinery, made it easier to end slavery, emancipate women, and educate children,\u201d writes Pinker. \u201cIt has allowed people to read at night, live where they want, stay warm in winter, see the world, and multiply human contact. Any costs in pollution and habitat loss have to be weighed against these gifts. \u2026 Cleaner is better, but not at the expense of everything else in life.\u201d\nCiting Yale University\u2019s Environmental Performance Index, Pinker writes,\nThe wealthier the country, on average, the cleaner its environment: the Nordic countries were cleanest; Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and several sub-Saharan African countries, the most compromised. Two of the deadliest forms of pollution\u2014contaminated drinking water and indoor cooking smoke\u2014are afflictions of poor countries. But as poor countries have gotten richer in recent decades, they are escaping these blights: the proportion of the world\u2019s population that drinks tainted water has fallen by five-eighths, the proportion breathing cooking smoke by a third.\u201d\nClimate realists have made similar arguments for decades. To quote the immortal John McClane (Die Hard), \u201cWelcome to the party, pal!\u201d\nSOURCES:\u00a0Scientific American;\u00a0Progress and Peril;\u00a0The Breakthrough\nBarely two years after leaders from 195 countries announced a global agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, those emissions are rising, not falling, as multiple countries are finding it difficult to make the cuts they promised in Paris in 2015,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reports.\nQuoting Robert Jackson, a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment,\u00a0The\u00a0Post\u00a0notes governments failing to meet carbon dioxide emission reduction goals is not a new problem.\n\u201c\u2018More than two decades ago, the world agreed to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in our air to prevent dangerous climate outcomes,\u2019 said Jackson, \u2026 referring to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change that set international negotiations in motion. \u2018To date, we have failed,\u2019\u201d the\u00a0Post\u00a0reports.\n\u201c\u2018Tremendous gains in energy efficiency and renewable power aren\u2019t yet reducing our global hunger for fossil fuels, especially oil and natural gas,\u2019 [Jackson] added,\u201d according to the\u00a0Post.\nGreenhouse gas emissions are rising in both developing and developed countries. Turkey, Indonesia, and developing countries throughout Asia and Africa are building and planning new coal-fired power plants to generate electricity necessary for economic growth. Forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and count toward some \u00a0countries\u2019 emission reduction targets under the Paris agreement, yet Brazil has been unable to prevent deforestation, which has actually risen, with 2016\u2019s total forest loss of almost 8,000 square kilometers close to double the level seen in 2012.\nMany developed countries, including some that pushed the hardest for the Paris agreement, are doing no better in meeting their goals. Germany, which set an aggressive near-term goal of cutting greenhouses gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2020, admitted in early 2017 it would be unable to hit its target. Greater use of coal caused Germany\u2019s emissions to increase in 2015 and 2016. The European Union as a whole is far below the pace necessary to meet its 2030 target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions 40 percent cut below 1990 levels by 2030. China also recently admitted its carbon dioxide emissions had begun to rise again, after remaining stable for two years.\nSOURCE:\u00a0The Washington Post\nCiting an analysis by Paul Homewood, who runs the climate blog \u201cNot A Lot Of People Know That,\u201d journalist James Delingpole writes, \u201cThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating \u2018global warming\u2019 by fiddling with the raw temperature data.\u201d\nUsing datasets from weather stations in New York state, Homewood discovered NOAA was writing recent record-breaking cold weather in late December 2017 and early January 2018 out of existence. The recent extreme cold spell along the U.S. Atlantic coast was noted for freezing sharks to death in the ocean and causing frozen iguanas to drop dead out of trees. Record daily lows and record daily low high temperatures were set in numerous locations along the eastern seaboard. Yet you wouldn\u2019t know that from examining NOAA\u2019s \u201cadjusted\u201d temperature records.\nHomewood discovered NOAA adjusted temperatures by as much as 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit, making past temperatures look colder than actually recorded and recent temperatures look warmer than they were.\nUsing New York datasets from the National Weather Service (NWS), Homewood exposed NOAA\u2019s shenanigans, first comparing the winters of 1943 and 2014 and then comparing 1943 to the winter beginning in late 2017.\nNWS determined,\nThe winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal.\nTemperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York. \u2026 Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region.\nYet Homewood found NOAA listed the 2013 through 2014 winter as only the 30th coldest winter since 1895 on its New York state charts. Comparing local NWS records for January 1943 and January 2014\u2014months which NOAA listed as having similar average temperatures\u2014Homewood found NOAA\u2019s charts were grossly in error. The agency adjusted 2014 local temperatures significantly upward while adjusting the 1943 temperatures downward. According to Homewood\u2019s analysis, \u201cOn average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7 [degrees Fahrenheit] less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9 [degrees Fahrenheit].\u201d\nHomewood did a similar comparison for the December 2017 through January 2018 freeze and found NOAA had fiddled with the data again.\nAccording to NOAA, January 2018 in New York was warmer than January 1943, yet the raw data from local stations tells a different story. Looking at temperatures from weather stations in the central lakes region of New York, for example, Homewood found NOAA reports the average temperature for Central Lakes was 20.8 degrees Fahrenheit in January 2018, 2.1 degrees warmer than the 18.7 degrees Fahrenheit it reports for January 1943.According to New York state\u2019s official climate reports, however, the \u00a0region\u2019s temperature was 20.6 F (1.9 degrees warmer than NOAA reports) in 1943, and the average temperature for January 2018 was 19.6 F (1.2 degrees colder than NOAA reports), one degree colder than 1943. NOAA adjusted the overall temperatures by more than 3.1 degrees.\nBased on this and other gross discrepancies between recorded temperatures and NOAA\u2019s adjusted data, Homewood concludes, \u201cClearly NOAA\u2019s highly \u2026 adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better?\u201d\nGood question.\nSOURCES:\u00a0Breitbart;\u00a0Not A Lot Of People Know That", "label": 1}, "text-202": {"text": "Global climate strike: how you can get involved\nThe global climate strike kicks off on Friday and will ripple across the world in more than 4,000 locations, the start of a weeklong movement to train international attention on the climate emergency.

This data has been collected over decades by the many port authorities along the Queensland coast, by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), and various government departments that often change their name. For example, there was a report published in 1999 jointly by the Department of Environment and Heritage and the Department of Natural Resources entitled \u2018Testing the Waters: A Report on the Quality of Queensland Waters\u2019.\nThis report concluded:\n\u201cIt is not possible to provide a simple summary of water quality across an area as large and varied as Queensland. However, a number of general comments can be made. Overall, the water quality maps indicate that while a significant proportion of sites reflect good water quality conditions, there are also a large number which indicate moderate (slightly impacted) conditions. Only relatively few are indicative of poor water quality conditions.\n\u201cPoint discharge from many urban areas have impacts on water quality in their vicinity. Because urban areas are concentrated along the coastal fringe, most of these impacts occur in estuarine waters. However, these impacts are considerably less than they were 20 years ago and there is continuing management effort focussed on bringing point discharge under control\u2026\u201d\nThe report went on to state that future editions of statewide water quality reports will build on the information presented in what was then considered the \u2018initial report\u2019, with few reports likely to give a more definitive indication of long term trends in water quality.\nIn fact, since 1999 despite increasing expenditure in the area of water quality monitoring it is increasingly difficult to access basic water quality data. The situation is absurd, and I am told it reflects the state and federal government\u2019s desire to maintain the perception of declining water quality, while in reality, the situation is improving. There could be general improvement because local governments have spent large amounts of money on better sewerage treatment, and rural industries have received significant funding to fence riparian areas, and more generally improve their land management practices.\nYet we are told that water quality continues to deteriorate, and this claim underpins increasingly regulation of industries that is the subject of this senate inquiry.\nThe first term of reference of this inquiry assumes an impact from farming on the Great Barrier Reef. It is important that the committee actually establish the nature and magnitude of this impact\nby way of real evidence. Ideally a detailed assessment of changes in key water quality parameters at relevant geographical and temporal scales will be provided.\nSo far key reports, for example a much quoted recent technical study by Marine Ecological Consultant Dr Daniela Ceccarelli, rely on overseas datasets that use obscure methods for measuring water quality. It is difficult to understand why the GBRMPA collects detailed water quality data, and then scientists like Ceccarelli and colleagues extrapolated from indirect measures.\nGiven the importance of understanding changes in water quality over time it is important that this inquiry ensure the following information be made publicly available without delay:\nRelevant water quality data including nutrient concentrations (e.g. chlorophyll a) and sediment loads (turbidity, e.g. Kd4010) at a daily, monthly and annual time scale for every major port, and every major inshore coral reef, along the Queensland coast since at least 1975. This is when this water quality data was first collected in a comprehensive and regular way.\nJust today, Friday 8th November 2019, I was diving the HMAS Brisbane Wreck off Mooloolaba close to my home in south east Queensland. My mind is still buzzing with the extraordinary diversity of reef fish (so many of all shapes and sizes) and corals (such diversity and so colourful) that I saw. This inshore reef just to the south of the Great Barrier Reef is so new: the old war ship having only been sunk into 28 metres of water 14 years ago in July 2005.\nThis new healthy coral reef ecosystem, with so much diversity, has come to be over the same period of time that studies by Ceccarelli and others claim there has been wide spread deterioration in water quality affecting off shore coral reefs. The impression is that if we don\u2019t tackle \u2018water quality locally\u2019 and \u2018climate change globally\u2019 all reefs will continue to see a significant decline in coral coverage. It also follows that new inshore reefs, like the coral reef that I visited yesterday, that was teeming with colour and new life could not exist.\nIn August I spent 10 days snorkelling, paddle boarding, and droning over the coral reefs of the northern and southern Whitsundays. I started at Horseshoe bay that is right in Bowen township, in fact there is a coffee shop within perhaps 250 metres of the southern headland where there are a great diversity of colourful corals growing on the granite.\nI was surprised to see such colourful, healthy corals straight-off the beach and so accessible from the mainland/a north Queensland town. A family can train/bus/drive to this local beach at Bowen and go snorkelling and find many of the corals found throughout the Great Barrier Reef. Indeed, the bays and headlands around Bowen offer an opportunity for anyone to see corals, without spending a lot of money. Yet newspaper headlines quoting leading academics including Professor Terry Hughes claim inshore corals in this region have been destroyed by global warming.\nAbout two kilometres from Horseshoe Bay at the entrance to Bowen Harbour, at the southern end of Stone Island, scientists curtailed a long transect across a reef flat of dead corals. The scientists ended it just 30 metres from the reef\u2019s edge where there is so much live coral to be found.\nThe edge of this fringing reef slopes to the sea floor with prolific growth and great diversity of hard and soft corals species. This reef edge, perhaps 20 metres wide in some places, extends for perhaps 2 kilometres around the western edge of Stone Island. Yet in the research report published in the prestigious journal Nature, it is claimed there are no live Acropora at this reef and describes only dead corals along the transect.\nAs reported by Graham Lloyd in The Weekend Australian (7 September 2019), I saw and photographed healthy branching Acropora and also large pink plate coral on 25 August 2019 \u2014 some of the plate corals were more than 1 metre in diameter at this reef edge. David Wachenfeld, the chief scientist at GBRMPA is an author of this most misleading study that appeared intent on finding only that part of the fringing reef system with dead corals.\nIt is the case that in nature, as in life, we can sometimes find whatever we are looking for and this is especially the case at some inshore reefs where there is only live coral at that reef\u2019s edge.\nAt some inshore reefs, if we look only for disaster and catastrophe it can be found in the rubble of the back reef from previous cyclones or from sea level fall.\nCyclones and sea level change \u2013 especially localised dramatic falls in sea level associated with El Ni\u00f1o events that cause widespread bleaching \u2013 will destroy individual coral gardens. But reef communities can recover if they are healthy and are spread over a critically large area. It is reefs that become infested, for example with crown-of-thorn star fish, that lack resilience and may not recover from natural disasters.\nCorals at inshore reefs are particularly subject to natural extremes of temperature, sea level change, and other environmental hazards, such as outbreaks of crown-of-thorn starfish.\nGiven that the Great Barrier Reef, as one ecosystem, comprises nearly 3000 individual reefs stretching for 2000 kilometres, damaged areas can always be found somewhere. And a coral reef that is mature and spectacular today, may be smashed by a cyclone tomorrow \u2014 though neither the intensity nor frequency of cyclones is increasing at the Great Barrier Reef despite climate change.", "label": 1}, "text-204": {"text": "The Guardian view on politics in Wales: a brewing crisis?\nOur starter for 10: who is the first minister of Wales?

If you did get it right, well done, because the understated Mr Drakeford would be the first to admit that he does not have quite the same profile as the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, or even the former Northern Irish first minister, Arlene Foster. The latter has not been in post for three years, but has been omnipresent throughout the Brexit debate. Of Mr Drakeford, if we live outside Wales, we hear next to nothing. Wales, with its population of just over 3 million and its 40 seats at Westminster, is largely ignored in the wider UK.\nThe general election gave the Conservatives their best night in Wales since 1983. They won Wrexham (a seat where before the second world war they rarely bothered to stand) for the first time and captured Bridgend in Labour\u2019s south Wales heartland. Overall, Labour got 41% of the vote, compared with the Tories\u2019 36%, and has 22 seats against the Tories\u2019 14 and Plaid Cymru\u2019s four. But in a country where Labour has tended until recently to exercise almost hegemonic power, and with high rates of poverty and deprivation that have been exacerbated by a decade of Westminster-imposed austerity, the party will take little comfort from keeping its nose in front.\nThe future relationship between Westminster and the Labour-led devolved government in Cardiff will be tricky.

The Welsh government was responsible for money channelled from the EU to depressed areas, but the UK government\u2019s proposed replacement \u2013 the Shared Prosperity Fund \u2013 is likely to be administered by Whitehall. It will be seen as a rolling back of devolution \u2013 the first stage, according to some, of an assault on the devolution settlement in Wales by the resurgent Tories \u2013 and the standoff could end up in the supreme court.\nWales has always been divided \u2013 north v south, urban v rural, Welsh-speaking v English-speaking \u2013 and after the election these divisions are starker than ever.

Plaid Cymru has held on to its four largely rural, Welsh-speaking seats, but with only 10% of the vote across Wales it cannot claim a surge in support for independence. Wales has traditionally lacked institutional autonomy \u2013 in marked contrast to Scotland, with its separate legal and educational systems. Wales has instead relied on its well-entrenched language in the fight for cultural separateness. But with a Welsh-language broadcaster, bilingualism in government and the media, and the emergence of a network of highly regarded Welsh-medium schools, that battle has now largely been won, removing the totem around which Welsh nationalists could once gather.\nAll this leaves Wales more than ever searching for an identity. Once, with iron, steel and coal, it was an industrial powerhouse. Twenty years ago it saw itself as a small country finding a home within Europe, with the EU as a less oppressive supra-state than a UK dominated by England. Now what is Wales, who represents it, how does it articulate its \u201cnot-England-ness\u201d post-Brexit, and what happens to the devolution settlement if the Tories start playing hardball?

The new bill would not increase the number of total days a student could miss, but it would add to the list of justified absences, excusing students \u201cfor the benefit of the mental or behavioral health of the pupil\u201d.\nMusic Watson, spokeswoman for the San Diego office of education, which oversees and supports more than 40 school districts in southern California, said that her office is still waiting for specifics to emerge on the bill, but that it seems in line with a larger push to boost mental health support for students \u2013 an effort that the office of education has gotten behind.\n\u201cWe want to make sure students get the help that they need, and have an obvious interest in helping reduce stigma and addressing the mental health issues youth are facing,\u201d Watson said.\nBut she said one concern for education officials is whether the bill would create an incentive to miss school more often, which could have an impact on learning and even a school\u2019s budget.\nBecause California schools receive funding based on student attendance, any absence, excused or not, means less money for schools.\nDr Mark Reinecke, a clinical director and psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, is broadly supportive of the bill, which he said reduces stigma and encourages young people to seek help, something that could offer long-term benefits.\nFor about three-quarters of adults who struggle with anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, symptoms first appeared in childhood, he said. Seeking treatment earlier could be a way to head off future problems.\nYet, Reinecke cautions against what he said could be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the legislation, which could increase absenteeism or even worsen symptoms for students dealing with phobias and anxiety around school.\nIn 2016, about 8 million students in the US missed three or more weeks of school, absences that put students at risk of lower test scores and higher dropout rates. In California, a student who misses 10% of the school year \u2013 about 18 days \u2013 is considered chronically absent.\nMissing school for any reason counts as lost instructional time, which tends to have particularly negative impact on young children, Reinecke said.\nIn short, the benefits of the bill would depend on how schools are implementing it.\n\u201cFor most teens, missing school to seek treatment would be greatly beneficial, and I think that\u2019s the way this bill is intended,\u201d Reinecke said.\n\u201cBut for children with school phobia or anxiety, missing school would be the last thing you want. It would magnify the problem.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Portantino has taken the legislative lead on issues affecting children and families.\nLast year, in an effort to give teenagers more sleep time, the lawmaker authored a bill to push back start times for high schools to 8.30am and middle schools to 8am or later. The bill was later signed into law.\nPortantino acknowledges a need to iron out specifics on the mental health bill, but said the conversation itself underscores the need for clarity in the education code.\n\u201cIf you sprain your ankle, we don\u2019t ask how bad it is, or whether it justifies missing work or school. We trust the person to get evaluated and the doctor to come to an informed decision. We\u2019re not talking about giving students an excuse to stay home \u2013 we\u2019re talking about treating this illness as we would any other illness,\u201d he said.\nThe bill is set to wind its way through the legislative process. If it survives, it could head to the governor\u2019s desk in the fall and become law no sooner than January 2021.", "label": 0}, "text-206": {"text": "'Both sides' of the climate change debate? How bad we think it is, and how bad it really is\nOver the past couple of weeks things have been happening on the climate change front but, unfortunately, little is changing in parliament, where the government\u2019s direct action policy has continued to be an utter failure and a Queensland LNP MP suggested in his first speech in the House of Representatives that schools should teach both sides of the climate change debate in school \u2013 to prevent them being \u201cbrainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies\u201d.\nLast week came news that BHP was going to spend US$400m over five years on a \u201cclimate investment program to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations as well as those generated from the use of its resources\u201d.\nIts CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, stated in a speech in London, \u201cSociety\u2019s combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes like steelmaking and agriculture have released greenhouse gases at rates much faster than at any other time in the geological past.\u201d\nTo ram the message home he concluded: \u201cThe evidence is abundant: global warming is indisputable. The planet will survive. Many species may not.\u201d\nJust ponder that: many species will not survive.\nThus it was not particularly surprising really to hear this week that the NSW HSC was going to include climate change in geography classes. The surprising element was that it doesn\u2019t already.\nThe government is utterly failing to achieve even its own pathetically low emissions reduction targets\nNeither was it surprising to see conservatives across the media come out against it, arguing that if they are to teach climate change then they need to teach \u201cboth sides\u201d. The IPA\u2019s \u201cdirector of the foundations of western civilisation program\u201d Bella d\u2019Abrera (yeah, I know) suggested on Sky News that \u201cthey\u2019re going to hear hopefully that climate change is not necessary manmade\u201d.\nOr in other words, students should hear that conspiracy theories are real.\nThis is the type of guff that you expect to hear from the libertarian romper room that Sky News is now. It\u2019s a station that gives a voice to the likes of Andrew Bolt, who this week devoted a column to calling 16-year-old climate-change activist Greta Thunberg \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d and mocking her autism diagnosis.\nShe responded by flicking him away with ease \u2013 which to be honest was not wholly difficult given I\u2019ve had cases of tinea that have contributed more to our national intelligence than has Bolt\u2019s entire media career. But she did it with class.\nIn parliament you would hope for better than the dredge we get on Sky News. But no.\nOn Wednesday, newly elected Queensland MP Terry Young gave his first speech, in which he stated \u201cwe want our children and grandchildren to hear the theories of evolution and creation, different religions, climate change advocates and climate change sceptics. I can say what we don\u2019t want for us and our kids is to be brainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies.\u201d\n\u201cTheories of creation\u201d? Religion is a theory now?\nHe continued arguing, \u201cWhen I hear a school principal stand up at school assembly and say \u2018if this government doesn\u2019t do anything about climate change, the world will end in 2030\u2019 I get angry, because we should not indoctrinate our kids with fear mongering.\u201d\nNow, firstly, I\u2019d like to know where that happened because I can find no record of it. It sort of happened in the TV show Big Little Lies, so maybe that was it.\nBut here\u2019s the thing, he should get angry if he hears that \u2013 not because it is brainwashing but because his government is not doing anything about climate change.\nThe world is not going to end in 2030, but if we have not taken massive steps by then, our ability to prevent massive global degradation and harm due to climate change will be beyond us.\nThis is not extremist, it is science \u2013 science that was announced in October by the UN IPCC. Its co-chair said at the time: \u201cThis is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.\u201d\nBut no, it didn\u2019t.\nYoung went on to suggest personal responsibility was more important and the fact his family own a hybrid car and have solar panels was a sign of how conservatives go about things the right way.\nIt is much the same line we have heard by so many conservatives \u2013 a variant of if we all plant a tree and recycle then that\u2019s all we can do.\nIt won\u2019t be anywhere near enough, and it might seem like \u201ccommon sense\u201d to Young but it is not. Just how lacking the LNP\u2019s climate change policy is in anything approaching substance was revealed this week when its latest auction under the \u201cemissions reduction fund\u201d bought cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution.\nThe government is utterly failing to achieve even its own pathetically low emissions reduction targets.\nAnd time is running out fast.\nThis week in the Monthly, ANU climate scientist Dr Jo\u00eblle Gergis wrote that, while in 2013 scientists had estimated that a doubling of CO2 levels from pre-industrial levels (which we\u2019re on track to do by 2060) would lead to a temperature increase of between 1.5C to 4.5C, now as scientists continue to get more data, their models suggest the temperature increase is more likely to be between 2.8C and 5.8C.\nThat\u2019s scary because all efforts at the moment are assuming if we reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 we can limit warming to 1.5C. That might now be rather too optimistic.\nAdd into the mix came further news this week that glaciers appear to be melting 10 to 100 times faster than expected.\nIt\u2019s time to stop being mealy-mouthed about this and to give silent passes to those peddling climate-change denialism either explicitly or implicitly by demanding we listen to both sides.\nBut OK, here\u2019s both sides of the debate \u2013 for well over 40 years scientists have been researching and testing evidence that climate change is occurring due to CO2 emissions. They have found conclusive evidence that there is a link and that on the current path by 2100 global temperatures will likely reach 3C above pre-industrial levels.\nThe other side is that they have kept researching and testing the data, and sorry, they were wrong \u2013 it\u2019s even worse than they thought.\n\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia", "label": 0}, "text-207": {"text": "prof happer: u.s. must withdraw from paris agreement - co2 not a pollutant but a benefit to humanity\nProfessor William Happer writes in the Washington Times: \u00a0\"The United States should withdraw from the \u00a0Paris Climate Agreement.

He promises to take sovereignty back from the political elites \u2013 and return it to \u201cthe people\u201d. The announcement of these tactics has caused alarm among those who fear democracy will be threatened by a \u201cpopulist\u201d politics of polarisation between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d.\nBut this fear of populism reveals something troubling about how we currently understand democratic politics. What most people seem to find shocking about Johnson\u2019s strategy is that it involves an \u201cus v them\u201d confrontation \u2013 as if democratic politics could avoid conflict between irreconcilable political projects.\nSince Thucydides and Machiavelli, we have known that politics involves conflict and antagonism and that it has, by definition, a partisan character. In politics, therefore, we are always dealing with an opposition between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d \u2013 which means it will always be necessary to draw a political frontier between the two sides.\nThis is still the case in a democracy: contrary to what is often asserted, democratic politics is not defined by the absence of such a frontier. In fact, what characterises a liberal pluralist democracy is the way this line is drawn \u2013 so that the \u201cthem\u201d are not seen as enemies to be destroyed, but as adversaries engaged in a confrontation between competing conceptions of the common good. When it is formulated in terms of an opposition between left and right \u2013 rather than in religious or ethnic terms \u2013 this frontier is crucial for democracy, because it provides the necessary framework for a confrontation between two legitimate positions.\nWith the advent of the third way in the 1990s, it became fashionable in some quarters to declare that the adversarial model of politics was now obsolete \u2013 so categories of right and left were no longer needed. But even the champions of a post-political consensus cannot avoid drawing a frontier between themselves and their rivals. Since they refuse to draw it in an adversarial way, they create a moral divide, which does not permit a true agonistic debate. Tony Blair pitted the modernisers against the traditionalists; for Emmanuel Macron, the frontier is between the progressives and the conservatives.\nAs traditional social democratic parties were converted to neoliberalism in the 1990s and 2000s, this non-adversarial conception of politics \u2013 which was deemed to be progress for democracy \u2013 became dominant across western Europe. Centre-left parties convinced themselves there was no alternative to the hegemony of financial capitalism, and implemented the policies favoured by finance capital \u2013 which have led to an exponential increase in inequality and the emergence of new forms of subordination, not only among the working classes, but also in significant sectors of the middle classes.\nSince the economic crisis of 2008, however, there has been growing resistance to an economic order that has produced a new class of oligarchs and a growing precariat. After decades of \u201cpost-politics\u201d, during which citizens were deprived of a voice in the way they were governed \u2013 under the pretence there was no alternative \u2013 we are now living through a populist moment. Political frontiers that were said to have vanished are now being reinstated, in the name of recovering democracy and popular sovereignty.\nThis is the context in which we must understand the recent success of rightwing populist parties. By repudiating the centrist consensus, and redrawing a political frontier between \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe establishment\u201d, they have promoted a challenge to the status quo that resonates with the feelings of many different constituencies who have been negatively affected by the consequences of neoliberal post-democracy.\nIn Britain, much of this resistance was given shape by the Brexit vote in 2016. The great success of the leave campaign was to link the grievances of a number of disparate groups by articulating anti-austerity and anti-establishment sentiments with a nationalistic flavour. The slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d provided a rallying cry for these various demands. By blaming the EU for the deterioration of social and political conditions in the UK, Brexit became a hegemonic signifier \u2013 one around which a new \u201cpeople\u201d, identified as leavers, has coalesced. These are the \u201cpeople\u201d Johnson pretends to represent and whose will he accuses parliament of disregarding.\nHow can we respond to such an offensive? We must not be tempted to counter Johnson\u2019s populism with a return to centrist politics. It is precisely such a centrist politics that is at the origin of the current democratic crisis in western Europe.\nSimilarly, we should not demonise all Brexiters as deplorables, or dismiss them for being unable to recognise the intellectual and moral superiority of the European project. The campaign to leave succeeded in part because there was a democratic kernel at the core of these demands \u2013 which reflected a widespread discontent with post-democracy.\nIn Britain, as in the rest of Europe, the way to answer the rightwing populist offensive is the construction of another \u201cpeople\u201d \u2013 through the articulation of a project that can link together various demands against the status quo. A project in which both leavers and remainers could feel that they have a voice and that their concerns are taken into account. One signifier for such a project could be a Green New Deal \u2013 which articulates multiple environmental and economic struggles around a demand for equality and social justice.\nTo be sure, such an \u201cus\u201d will never include everybody. It does, of course, require a \u201cthem\u201d and the drawing of a political frontier. But we can have a frontier that makes democracy more radical \u2013 one that pits the people against the oligarchy, and the many against the few.\n\u2022 Chantal Mouffe is professor of political theory at the University of Westminster", "label": 0}, "text-209": {"text": "Robert Zimmerman notes that we have arrived at a \u201csolar minimum\u201d in terms of sunspots.

If I was renting I\u2019d be utterly fucked, so I know I\u2019m doing better than a lot of people, so I try to be grateful for that.\nI well understand the economic reasoning for the stimulus and as a socialist I agree with it, but it\u2019s unconscionable to be leaving disabled people behind once again.\nI think about the ones trapped in abusive relationships (which we are much more at risk of) being even more stuck now because of financial issues.\nI see the attempts at manufactured consent to \u201copen the economy\u201d, ending the lockdown because it\u2019s only \u201cold\u201d people at risk right?\nPeople like me just don\u2019t exist. Never seen, never heard.\nI\u2019ve been staying in crisis accommodation at the Hougoumont Hotel in Fremantle for about a month. When the Covid-19 lockdowns began, I was terrified. It frightened me because I\u2019ve got respiratory problems, emphysema. I didn\u2019t want to die. I was thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not going to die on the streets here\u201d.\nI\u2019m more frightened of the disease than living on the streets. At least on the streets, we\u2019re all family, we\u2019ve got that bond between all of us.\nThe people at the hotel have been great. I did have friends here, but they have been moved on to another place. I wanted to be with them but the government won\u2019t let me, they are not taking any more people.\nWhen I haven\u2019t been on the street during the crisis, I\u2019ve been going from motel to motel. It just reminds me of being a kid, moving from foster home to foster home.\nOn the streets, I don\u2019t like how they were treating us homeless mob, like we\u2019ve all got the disease. It\u2019s like we\u2019re back on the mission. They\u2019ve got us lined up for a feed. We\u2019ve got to stay so many metres apart from one another. It\u2019s just confusing.\nI just need a house now. It\u2019s been seven or eight years since I\u2019ve had one. The government has not helped me whatsoever.\nWhat\u2019s going to happen to me next is the big question mark. I don\u2019t know.\nI have a visual impairment, optic nerve hyperplasia. It means I have no vision in the left eye and partial in the right. I also have epilepsy.\nIt took me 18 months to get on the disability support pension. Now I do the advocacy for the Anti-Poverty Network. A lot of it is supporting people in meetings with job providers. We can\u2019t really do that at the moment. So I\u2019ve been trying to help out by messaging people who have questions about Centrelink.\nThe lines at Centrelink challenge the narrative of the \u201cdole bludger\u201d, right? You\u2019ve got all these people who have just been laid off due to the crisis. A lot of them will never work again.\nNow for some people they have really sped up the process of how long Centrelink claims take. A lot of people are having an easier time. I\u2019m happy about that.\nBut this is the thing I really want to emphasise: we need to make sure that this is permanent. The big concern is that when this crisis sort of goes away, they\u2019re going to be like, \u201cAll right, we can start rolling back over these advancements we\u2019ve made\u201d.\nI\u2019m a stay-at-home mum of four kids, twin girls, who are eight, a four-year-old girl and three-year-old son.\nI was working from home as a hairdresser, offering that service so I can have my son home with me as he has sensory issues: ADHD, slight autism and global development delay, also separation anxiety.\nNow I am home schooling three children with a donated laptop. My three girls have to share one laptop as I don\u2019t have the money to get them another.\nWe are going on week eight now of home schooling. We are scraping by fortnight to fortnight. With the children being home 24/7, they are bored. So they eat.\nI\u2019m upset that I fought so hard to get on carer\u2019s payments for my son for months. Now we are at a loss. We get $750 supplements but we miss out on the $550 a fortnight for six months.\nYes, I could apply for jobseeker but then I lose my carer\u2019s pension and that\u2019s not an option for me. I think it\u2019s so wrong for people that are carers to get punished despite everything we do.\nI am a disability pensioner, a student and work casually as a research assistant. I also belong to a community of young women with complex trauma histories who are trying to survive on the disability support pension while working towards their recovery and their education.\nI receive the disability support pension for my dissociative disorder and complex PTSD. My treatment is particularly expensive, largely absent in the public system.\nEven working when I can, the pension barely covers the hundreds of dollars I spend every month on therapy, medication and specialist medical care to manage the legacies of my childhood abuse.\nI go back and forth between a sense of hurt and abandonment about our exclusion from the coronavirus supplement, to a sense of dread about the scarcity I see on my horizon. I feel angry disability pensioners as well as caregivers have been overlooked and excluded.\nIn the Covid-19 crisis, I can no longer ration my pain meds as the ambient anxiety settles in my nervous system. Instead of catching a bus, I now have to drive 30km to and from medical appointments and therapy three times a week.\nSome allied healthcare clinics where I receive treatment on a sliding scale have had to close \u2013 now I have to pay full price elsewhere.\nThese additional expenses may seem small, but as a disability pensioner there is absolutely zero slack in my budget.\nThe isolation and collective anxiety during Covid-19 has been difficult for me as a complex trauma survivor. Trauma has made my nervous system especially sensitive to cues of threat and especially reactive to uncertainty.\nAs told to Luke Henriques-Gomes.

Republicans will weaponize anything \u2013 even in-person voting during a deadly pandemic \u2013 to maintain power, avoid accountability and bend electoral rules in their favor. Worse, the US supreme court will have their back.\nMake no mistake: the deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from Wisconsin on Tuesday \u2013 Americans on line for hours, wearing homemade masks, risking a gruesome respiratory disease to exercise their right to vote \u2013 wasn\u2019t just a warning sign for November\u2019s elections. It was Republicans\u2019 dress rehearsal.\nIt\u2019s scarcely 200 days until the real show. The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It\u2019s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well.\nThat\u2019s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done; five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn\u2019t favor either party \u2013 just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It\u2019s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: a study of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade.\nNothing about the Wisconsin election was normal\nRepublicans, however, have fought efforts to fund expanded voting options this fall. President Trump recently told Fox & Friends: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d On Wednesday, he tweeted that vote by mail creates \u201ctremendous potential\u201d for voter fraud and mused that \u201cfor whatever reason, [it] doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans\u201d. Georgia\u2019s state house speaker knows that reason, opposing it because it \u201cwill certainly drive up turnout\u201d and \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives\u201d.\nBut while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party\u2019s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president\u2019s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso insisted they \u201chave no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people\u201d. Election assistance funding, sniffed his colleague Marsha Blackburn, \u201chas nothing to do with Covid-19\u201d.\nOn Tuesday, however, the connection between voting and the virus should have been clear enough for even a Republican senator to see. When Robin Vos, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear. He looked like one of those mean government agents looking to capture ET, which only undercut his assurances that voters stacked up in the five available Milwaukee precincts had absolutely nothing to fear.\nNothing about the Wisconsin election was normal. Not voters in homemade masks, not the immunocompromised woman whose requested absentee ballot never arrived voting in full bubble wrap, not the plaintive signs that read \u201cthis is ridiculous\u201d. But the five conservative Republican appointees to the US supreme court, concerned, ruefully and almost comically, that something might \u201cfundamentally alter the nature of the election\u201d, stepped in \u2026 on the side of forcing tens of thousands of Wisconsinites to brave the pandemic and vote in person.\nAlong a dreary 5-4 party line vote, the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority, most appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, overturned two lower-court rulings that had extended the vote-by-mail deadline until next week, despite evidence that tens of thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be delivered to voters who requested them, and that untold thousands more might not be postmarked in time. Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.)\nThat the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Under his leadership, this court has embraced his cramped vision with gusto.\nThe Roberts court has made clear that it should not be looked to as any guarantor of the foundational right to vote. Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013\u2019s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities.\nThe legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018\u2019s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the \u201cpresumption of good faith\u201d \u2013 even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018\u2019s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision \u2013 Common Cause v Rucho \u2013 which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary.\nElected Republican officials have proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections\nGerrymandering and voter purges were at the heart of the GOP urgency to hold this election, this week, with this diminished turnout. A critical state supreme court seat was on the ballot. The winner could sway an upcoming appeal over whether Wisconsin can purge about 240,000 voters from its rolls ahead of November \u2013 keep in mind, Trump only won this state by 22,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 and could also determine whether Republicans, once again, have a free hand to gerrymander the state\u2019s legislative and congressional maps in 2021. The maps the party carefully engineered in 2011, behind closed doors at a Madison law firm, delivered a 63-36 Republican edge among state assembly districts in 2018, even though Democrats won nearly 54% of the statewide vote, and a statewide edge of about 200,000 votes.\nNon-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November\u2019s election doesn\u2019t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there\u2019s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it\u2019s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November.\nThe Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it\u2019s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail. Mislead the public with fictional claims of voter fraud that get amplified on Fox News and by Russian bots on Twitter. Finally, count on John Roberts and the court\u2019s partisan 5-4 majority to backstop any efforts to make free, fair and safe voting more difficult.\nIf this plays out according to the Republican plan, it will plunge this nation from an unprecedented public health crisis into a dark constitutional emergency that threatens the legitimacy of the White House, the courts and American democracy itself. That\u2019s a frightening sentence to write. But it\u2019s long past time we call this what it is: elected Republican officials, and the conservatives who they have handed lifelong tenure on the federal bench, have now proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections that might oust them from power. They have used a pandemic to suppress votes.\nThe warning sirens are real. The dress rehearsal is over. There are barely 200 days until election day.\nDavid Daley is the author of Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count", "label": 0}, "text-214": {"text": "William Hill award has done so much to help sports writing leap off the page\nThere was a time, a generation or so ago, when high street bookshops were a wasteland for sportswriting. The entire subject was usually relegated to a single shelf in a dusty corner, with slabs of the Rothmans Football Yearbook or the Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanack manspreading next to turgid autobiographies and regurgitated annuals. Those who wanted to learn chess, bridge or squash were well catered for. Everyone else, not so much.\nBut then came the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, which will name its 30th winner on Tuesday, and suddenly everything became more electric \u2013 and eclectic.\nFrom the start it cleverly played fast and loose with what constituted a sports book, encouraging publishers and eventually bookshops to take risks and expand their horizons. No wonder winners since have ranged from WHSmith crowdpleasers (It\u2019s Not About the Bike, Seabiscuit) and instant classics (Rough Ride, Dark Trade, A Life Too Short) to an Oxford poet\u2019s account of learning aikido with the Japanese riot police (Angry White Pyjamas).\nHow has it got away with being so bold and diverse? Much of it was because two of Fleet Street\u2019s greatest \u2013 the Daily Mail\u2019s Ian Wooldridge and the Observer\u2019s Hugh McIlvanney \u2013 were on the judging panel from the off, conferring it instant legitimacy. Each year both men would arrive at the judges\u2019 lunch or dinner armed with different books, like gunslingers at the end of a Clint Eastwood western, according to Graham Sharpe, who co-founded the award with John Gaustad of Sportspages.\nThere was then an eerie silence before the other judges started lining up behind one or the other, although differences were always settled \u2013 eventually \u2013 after fierce debates and several bottles of plonk. \u201cThere are never regrets or grudges held,\u201d insists Sharpe. \u201cIt is like boxing. People smash each other up but in the end they always embrace.\u201d\nMore often than not the judges have got it right. Sometimes, however, their decisions are so perplexing you wonder whether their drinks were spiked with extra-strength absinthe. In 1999 A Social History of English Cricket somehow emerged triumphant ahead of Joe McGinniss\u2019s The Miracle of Castel di Sangro and David Remnick\u2019s King of the World \u2013 a work as dazzling as its subject Muhammad Ali\u2019s hand speed. No wonder the estimable Frank Keating wondered on these pages whether \u201cthe judges had such a donnybrook that the conservative outsider was the only one they could \u2018agree to disagree\u2019 on\u201d.\nHowever, its stock continued to grow particularly when the size of the \u201cWilliam Hill award effect\u201d became apparent. One publisher mentioned a book that had sold 20,000 before the award in late November put on another 30,000 before Christmas after its victory. Another said he would tell wavering sales directors that a potential book had a chance of being a William Hill contender, which often led to it being snapped up. It helped too that the first winner, True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny, and the fourth, Fever Pitch, became films.\nOf course Nick Hornby\u2019s fanography did far more than just that. As Keating put it on these pages, Fever Pitch\u2019s victory created a \u201cwhole new liturgy for the literati \u2026 suddenly it was compulsory for every city\u2019s \u2018top end Hampstead\u2019 intellectuals to gather around dinner tables and talk with rapt studiousness, not about Pinter, Amis or Truffaut, but Robson and Seaman and Gazza.\u201d\nWhether the award was at the vanguard of this change \u2013 as Keating claimed \u2013 or whether it merely surfed a wider societal trend is one for the pub. It should also be acknowledged that in 1998, when the William Hill prize celebrated its 10th birthday and was arguably at its zenith, the most popular book on Sportpages\u2019 shelves was Guvnors: The Autobiography of a Football Hooligan Gang Leader. And the literati probably were not reading that.\nIncidentally this year the familiar judging tradition continued with the winner \u2013 which will be announced on Tuesday lunchtime \u2013 finally being decided just before 1am at a recent dinner. The seven-strong shortlist, selected from a record 141 entries, is typically diverse, with unflinching biographies of Tiger Woods and Eamonn Magee squaring off against titles such a A Boy In the Water, Tom Gregory\u2019s charming coming-of-age story about becoming the youngest person to swim the channel, and Fear and Loathing on the Oche, a gonzo account of the world of darts.\nMany regard the Woods biography as the favourite. Then again, favourites have a shocking recent record. Indeed the past five winners \u2013 on doping in 1960s racing, the dark side of Australian rules football, surfing, the meaning of English football, and a photo essay on the cyclist Tom Simpson \u2013 have been so leftfield they have frustrated some mainstream publishers, who fear that the award is losing some of its cachet and power to boost sales. As one put it to me: \u201cThey keep going for the most obscure book on the shortlist.\u201d\nYet still they come, and for good reason. The William Hill remains the Champions League of sports book awards, and a hallmark of quality that ranks alongside any mastercraftsman. As the agent David Luxton wisely put it: \u201cOver 30 years it has shone some serious light on a genre of writing that was not appreciated as it should have been. And every time you enter a bookshop, and see the range and quality of titles on display, you understand the massive difference it has made.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-215": {"text": "Diet, health, inequality: why Britain's food supply system doesn't work\nTim Lang likes to take the long view. A conversation with the internationally renowned professor of food policy at London\u2019s City University will roam in detail from the repeal of the Corn Laws, through Brexit and back again, the narrative seasoned with detailed facts and figures. It\u2019s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, Feeding Britain, that, \u201calthough not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge\u201d, it\u2019s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble.\nLang, who established the pioneering Centre for Food Policy at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. \u201cI did not write that lightly,\u201d he says, when we meet in central London. \u201cI sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.\u201d Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. \u201cI like my food,\u201d he says. \u201cMore joy around food has come into our lives.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food\nAnd yet, he says, all of that masks a bitter reality: we have a massively fragile just-in-time supply chain which could easily collapse; a depleted agriculture sector which produces only around 50% of the food we actually eat, leaving us at the mercies of the international markets; and production methods which are damaging to the environment and human health. \u201cWhen I looked at the numbers on inequality,\u201d he says, \u201cI was shocked. There\u2019s a staggering gap between rich and poor in terms of wealth and income and therefore access to food.\u201d As he says: \u201cFood is the biggest driver of NHS spending as a result of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\u201d Food may look cheap, he adds, but too much of it creates vast, unsustainable costs elsewhere.\nHis doorstep of a book attempts both diagnosis and cure. Consciously, it pushes the impact of Brexit to one side to get at the underlying dysfunction. Likewise, we agree to discuss the implications of coronavirus later. Nevertheless, he says, it all amounts to the same thing. \u201cThere is a mismatch between human need, the food system and its outcomes.\u201d\nAt the heart of this crisis is a British willingness to let a small number of corporations dominate food retailing: just eight companies control 90% of our food supply. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018leave it to Tesco\u2019 approach,\u201d he says. The prioritisation of price has hollowed out UK agriculture, so that primary producers get the smallest slice of the cake. \u201cThey get about 5% or 6% of the value of the food we buy. They need double that. And that 50% self-sufficiency should be nearer 80%. Not out of nationalism, but so we are in a position to contribute globally. We have a default position of assuming someone else will feed us.\u201d\nThe book comes freighted with eye-popping data. For example, of the six million hectares of cultivatable land in Britain, only 168,000 hectares are used for fruit and vegetables. As a result, we have to import vast amounts of crops we could otherwise be growing. Much of the remaining land is used for crops to feed livestock or for processed foods.\n\u201cThe government is now so reliant on the retailers, they are setting them up to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the height of the arguments over a no-deal Brexit, the heads of the big food companies were briefing the government about just how fragile the food supply chain is. Brexit has shone a spotlight on that fragility.\u201d I ask where he thinks this dysfunctional system has come from. \u201cThere is a culture of British exceptionalism. We were the first industrial nation in the 18th century and then became the dominant imperial power in the 19th century and pursued that as a way of feeding ourselves.\u201d Critics often point out that we were less self-sufficient in food in the early 20th century than we are now. True, Lang says, but that was specifically because we had an empire which we ravaged to keep our tables and bellies full.\nHe\u2019s at pains to acknowledge that he is not the first person to raise these issues. He first became interested in the subject in the 1970s when, having just completed his social psychology PhD, he started farming in Wales. He came across a book called Our Food Problem and Its Relation to Our National Defences, published in 1939. One of its authors was Frederick Le Gros Clark, a sometime children\u2019s writer who went on to become an expert in malnutrition. Like Lang, he argued that the British food supply chain was exceedingly delicate and was not serving the health of the nation. The outbreak of war would prove him right. There was also a review of the British food system in 1936 by William Beveridge, later architect of the welfare state, who made similar arguments. \u201cBeveridge was totally ignored,\u201d Lang says.\nWhen the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food\nIn the summer of 2019, then Defra secretary Michael Gove announced he was establishing a national food strategy, which was broadly welcomed by the food industry. He put his friend Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, in charge of the review, even though he has no academic credentials in the field. Lang is polite about the classic British choice of a non-expert generalist to lead the review, but he does say that he\u2019s concerned that, like Beveridge, Dimbleby\u2019s review will be ignored when it\u2019s eventually published. \u201cWhen the new agriculture bill was introduced in January, it had almost nothing about food,\u201d he says.\nWhat\u2019s Lang\u2019s solution? It\u2019s detailed and includes the introduction of a food resilience and sustainability act, complete with legally binding targets. National nutritional guidelines should become the basis for food procurement contracts, both public and private. There should be an audit of food production in the UK and the budget for public health should be doubled from \u00a32.5bn of the \u00a3130bn health budget to \u00a35bn. It also proposes the creation of no fewer than nine bodies or institutions, including a royal commission to map a new set of \u201cmulti-criteria principles for the UK food system\u201d, a food resilience and sustainability council and a network of urban and rural food and farming colleges.\nI suggest this is an old-fashioned 1970s corporatist approach; that he\u2019s proposing a massive expansion of the state to deal with the problem. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been pretty modest,\u201d Lang says. \u201cThe British state is failing us by not decentralising.\u201d He also calls for Tesco, which has around 30% of the food retail market, to be broken up, so that no one firm has more than 15%. Likewise, he calls for pension funds to disinvest from manufacturers of ultra-processed foods, as some have started doing with fossil fuels. The list goes on. He insists, however, that this is not some kneejerk leftist manifesto. \u201cWe just need to re-engineer how capitalism works for us.\u201d\nWe agree we can no longer ignore the viral elephant both inside the room and outside it. Might the coronavirus crisis help with the re-engineering of our food supply chain? He agrees, sadly, that it might. \u201cIt could prove a good reminder of the value of state institutions,\u201d he says.

The Australian Health Protection Principle committee has also been asked to consider allowing community sport and reopening more retail shops.\nBut Murphy warned Australia would be at \u201cpermanent risk of further waves\u201d of infection and international travel will be banned for at least another four months.\nHe acknowledged that some states had implemented restrictions differently \u201cat the margins\u201d but he would be \u201cconcerned if there are major changes in one state\u201d without national cabinet agreement.\nAsked about the contact tracing app under development, Edwards reiterated that downloading it will be voluntary and no geolocation data will be stored.\nEdwards told the hearing when users download the app they give only their name, age range and postcode. They are then assigned a unique identifier. The app works by swapping unique identifiers with another user who is within 1.5 metres for a period of 15 minutes or more, she said, and all information is encrypted and stored on the phone.\nInformation will sit on the phone \u201cnever used\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t go anywhere at all\u201d, until it is destroyed when the app is deleted, Edwards said, or a person contracts Covid-19 in which case it will be accessed in an unencrypted form by public health officials.\nEarlier, Coatsworth said this operated as a two-step consent, as users would have to choose both to download the app and then later to release its data.\nEdwards said the purpose of the app is \u201csolely to assist in the public health response, particularly the contact tracing processes that states and territories already do\u201d and data would be not be used for compliance, enforcement or any other purpose.\nEdwards said she was aware that legislation governing the use of the app was one option being considered, but it could be implemented through agreements with the states and territories about how they use data and \u201cbiosecurity declarations\u201d.\nEdwards said legislation or biosecurity declarations could prevent data being obtained with a warrant or under a subpoena, and the department was \u201calive to the issue\u201d of preventing it being admitted to court.\nAustralia\u2019s biosecurity laws allow the health minister to \u201cdetermine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary\u201d to prevent entry or spread of a disease, subject to safeguards including that orders are \u201cappropriate and adapted\u201d to their purpose.\nEdwards said the app requires Bluetooth to be enabled to work, and currently works \u201cbetter on Android\u201d than iPhones although \u201cboth are working\u201d and performance is improving on both systems.\n\u201cI think 40% would be great take-up, we\u2019d like 90% [take-up] or more,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe more who do take it up the better. We haven\u2019t got a particular number in mind.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be happy if 20% do, I\u2019ll be happier if 40% do, I\u2019ll be even happier if 80% do because it will give more data to our health officials.\u201d\nAsked about Hunt\u2019s goal of 40%, Edwards replied she is \u201cnot aware of the basis of that number\u201d.\nOn Thursday, the attorney general Christian Porter told Guardian Australia that \u201cspecific regulatory action will be taken to prevent such access for law enforcement agencies at both the commonwealth and state/territory level\u201d.\n\u201cThe government has already made the decision not to make any information collected by the app available for other purposes, including law enforcement investigations,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "text-217": {"text": "Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism. Have we got the stomach for it?\nClimate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young, such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement, which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents\u2019 generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on. In comparison, the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change. The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years, but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency. The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires, floods and hurricanes.\nToday\u2019s children, as they become more politically aware, will be much more radical than their parents, simply because there will be no other choice for them. This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise. The Green New Deal (GND), a term presently most associated with 29-year-old US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the \u201cpro free market\u201d wing, who argue that it\u2019s a Trojan horse, nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation.\nThe criticism feels ridiculous. Partly because the GND is far from truly radical and already represents a compromise solution, but mainly because the radical economics isn\u2019t a hidden clause, but a headline feature. Climate change is the result of our current economic and industrial system. GND-style proposals marry sweeping environmental policy changes with broader socialist reforms because the level of disruption required to keep us at a temperature anywhere below \u201cabsolutely catastrophic\u201d is fundamentally, on a deep structural level, incompatible with the status quo.\nRight now we can, with a massive investment of effort by 2030, just about keep the warming level below 1.5C. This is \u201cbad, but manageable\u201d territory. Failing to put that effort in sees the world crossing more severe temperature barriers that would lead to outcomes like ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, mass desertification, and coastal cities being flooded into inhabitability.\nWe will simply have to throw the kitchen sink at this. Policy tweaks such as a carbon tax won\u2019t do it. We need to fundamentally re-evaluate our relationship to ownership, work and capital. The impact of a dramatic reconfiguration of the industrial economy require similarly large changes to the welfare state. Basic incomes, large-scale public works programmes, everything has to be on the table to ensure that the oncoming system shocks do not leave vast swathes of the global population starving and destitute. Perhaps even more fundamentally, we cannot continue to treat the welfare system as a tool for disciplining the supposedly idle underclasses. Our system must be reformed with a more humane view of worklessness, poverty and migration than we have now.\nUnfortunately for our children, the people they have to convince of all this are the people who have done very well out of this system, and are powerfully incentivised to deny that it is all that bad. Already, Joke Schauvliege, a Belgian environment minister, has been forced to resign after falsely claiming that she had been told by Belgian state security services that \u201cghosts\u201d behind the scenes were behind demonstrations in Belgium.\nThis conspiracism of the elite, these claims that genuine mass movement can\u2019t possibly really exist and must be in some way being guided by agents provocateurs, is just one of the ways in which those currently running things have resorted to a kind of political gaslighting in an attempt to maintain their grip on power.\nGaslighting is a term I don\u2019t use lightly, because it describes a genuine form of emotional abuse, where an abuser will deny reality in an attempt to get their victim to literally doubt their own sanity, and this should not be diluted by overuse. Yet I struggle to think of another word that adequately sums up the way in which \u201csensible\u201d adults are doubling down on their tactic of manufacturing a political reality which bears no relationship to the world we see around us. It\u2019s the Marxism of Groucho rather than Karl: \u201cWho are you going to believe? The serious political professionals or your own lying eyes?\u201d\nUS Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s meeting with schoolchildren petitioning her to take action over the issue went viral because of the way she condescended to them for, basically, asking her to leave them a planet behind to live on. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years,\u201d she said, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d The obvious response is, of course, that messing something up for 30 years is quite long enough, thanks. Long tenure without results is not the same thing as expertise.\nThis is a tough and bitter pill to swallow for the political professionals whose feet are firmly under the table. It is increasingly obvious that all their tactics have done almost nothing except run down the clock, but still they insist that it\u2019s the young who just don\u2019t get it and that things aren\u2019t that simple. They\u2019re the living embodiment of the famous New Yorker cartoon, with a suited man sat in a post-apocalyptic landscape telling his young audience \u201cYes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.\u201d\nThis is reality v the vested interests of the powerful. Any meaningful policy has to upset the established power base and the political donor class. Any policy that doesn\u2019t upset these people will be useless. To pretend that we can compromise our way through this while we wait for a magical, technological bullet that will keep temperatures down without costing us anything is beyond wilful ignorance now. It is a question of basic morality.\nMany of today\u2019s climate strikers won\u2019t even be 30 by the time the 1.5C deadline comes around in 2030. They are asking us to consider a simple question: is their future worth more than preserving our reputations?

Guardian readers share their thoughts.\nI work in an open plan office with a roughly 50/50 split of men and women. Some of the men talk about sport. They rib each other sometimes when various teams win or lose. I don\u2019t think it excludes people, it\u2019s what they enjoy and like to talk about. Some of my female colleagues also like football and tennis and they join in on the banter about things like \u2018that player was rubbish, your team was useless, what a goal\u2019 etc.\nPersonally I don\u2019t see an issue with banter. I think Ann Francke came across really badly (I listened to the programme) and made women look too sensitive and some of the men this morning were joking about not being able to talk about sport in front of women! Nicki, London\nI have found the comments extremely sexist. I have been a season ticket holder since the late 70s. Although I have been retired for some time I have no recollection of the female colleagues being or feeling \u201costracised\u201d because of the football chat in the office. Many women who did not attend games still had an interest and were able to join the chat. Granted when I started watching football there were not a lot of women attending matches but certainly from the 90s onward I worked beside more and more women who attended matches too and could obviously join any chat.\nNow we have many many women playing football as well as going to games. Does Ann Francke think women in the office only talk of shopping, or soaps or other \u2018female\u2019 topics (please note the sarcasm)? Are men ostracised in the workplace when women talk of these things? Terry, female, retired bank employee, Edinburgh\nWhen I started teaching business to sixth form students students 20 or so years ago I regularly used football examples until one of the few girls in a class asked if we could talk about ponies and ballerinas instead! It\u2019s always stuck with me as a reminder. In reality however, everyone in a workplace is going to discuss what they are interested in so this is a meaningless discussion. Eddy, 51, sixth form teacher, Sussex\nI am a woman and a lifelong sports fan. I would start by calling the use of that vile word \u2018banter\u2019 pejorative and exclusive. If you call something \u2018banter\u2019 inherently there\u2019s a problem. I am senior and autonomous enough to stop excess discussion of sports simply because: \u201cOK, great, as not everyone is interested in sport, let\u2019s talk about something else now\u201d\nI would note it is not just women who get excluded. Quite a lot of men also hate the assumption they must be interested in sport, and that seems to be a lifelong thing that raises old issues. When I entered the workplace, it was golf and rugby union. These days it would be triathlon, or the corporate half-marathon, or other things that require a lot of training time and out-of-hours participation. It is really very easy to see those as a modern way of limiting women\u2019s progress. Ideally, it should be dealt with routinely just by it being shut down. Victoria, Germany\nIt all depends from place to place and personalities involved. If it crosses the line of banter to the personal, or in any way bigoted, then yes by all means crack down on the individuals. But to crack down on the whole event of bantering among colleagues is ridiculous in my view. Where will it stop? What next will be viewed as unacceptable? There are a lot of women out there who enjoy football and other sports. Not all conversations carried out in a working environment will be inclusive and the intent of banter is not to exclude, rather to play and be lighthearted. Granted some people do take it too far but those individuals should suffer the consequences rather than the entire office. Surely as adults one can choose to participate or ignore the whole episode? Cracking down and stopping something that sometimes happens organically can have adverse impacts on moral and interpersonal relationships between colleagues. Revival Nkomo, 41, works in antigen manufacturing, Milton Keynes\nIt\u2019s not only women who feel ostracised by football talk. I have never, nor will I ever have any interest in football. I hear the same conversation about the same previous night\u2019s game at least four times in a day. My problem with football discussions at work are the same as I have about smoking breaks \u2013 why should those that do not smoke not benefit from several 10 minute breaks a day? I feel the same for football fans; if they can have lengthy talks about football three times a day, can I sit at my desk and start reading? N, Manchester\nSports is not a gender specific topic. I have just taught my class of eight-year-olds all about how gender doesn\u2019t play a role in what you can achieve. We talked about elite female athletes like Serena Williams and Julie Ertz. We looked at the historical treatment of women in sports \u2013 the FA disbanding the women\u2019s game, the first female to run a marathon etc. We have girls on the \u2018boys\u2019 football team. We are trying to raise these children to see through trivial things like gender.

We will see England, the reigning Commonwealth champions, going for gold at the Netball World Cup 2019 next week, and the Women\u2019s Ashes are in full swing. But nothing has captured the nation\u2019s imagination quite like the women\u2019s football World Cup.\nI\u2019m one of those people who, when asked if I watch football, replies: \u201cOnly when the World Cup is on\u201d - but I never thought that response would also encompass the women\u2019s game. Given how generously the title \u201crole model\u201d is handed out to footballers, it has been refreshing to watch players living up to it for once. Simply by existing, the Women\u2019s World Cup teams provide a direct challenge to stifling ideas of what a woman can do \u2013 and what a healthy woman looks like. And while there are still no openly gay male footballers active in the upper echelons of the sport, there are many openly lesbian players, coaches and trainers who are outspoken about LGBT and women\u2019s rights in the female game.\nThis, however, is just one of the things about women\u2019s football that appears to rub some up the wrong way. When the US player Megan Rapinoe said in an interview that \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House\u201d if her team won the tournament, Trump reacted with characteristic charm, tweeting, \u201cMegan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!\u201d. She went on to score two more goals in the quarter-final victory over France.\nPiers Morgan isn\u2019t a fan, either. Rapinoe\u2019s open-armed celebration after a goal apparently offended him, prompting that she \u201csure does love herself\u201d (what footballer doesn\u2019t?) and that he hoped England would \u201cdent her stupendous ego\u201d in the semi-final. Yet the team have made a habit of proving gobby, insecure men wrong \u2013 and they won 2-1. Anyway, the problem, it appears, was less about the celebration and more who it came from \u2013 because days later, Morgan tweeted praise for the batsman Jonny Bairstow\u2019s century by sharing an image of the cricketer pulling an almost identical pose to Rapinoe\u2019s.\nWith their very existence so obviously riling up certain types, part-time fans like myself end up seeing disgruntled sexists, rather than the other team, as our opponents. And given the cesspool of sexual misconduct allegations, racist chants and general toxicity men\u2019s football can be, it feels as though we\u2019re clutching at straws to try to make the women\u2019s teams as offensive as male footballers have a reputation for being.\n\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

She said the ban was so broad and unclear it would affect thousands of people.\n\u201cThere would be many thousands of members of Extinction Rebellion and you would not necessarily know who those members were,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is impossible for police to enforce. How are they going to know who is a member of the group? It\u2019s not like they have paid-up members with membership lists. It\u2019s just a political affiliation of a group of people with similar ideas.\u201d\nWright said similar bail conditions were usually reserved for members of bikie gangs, not political or social groups.\n\u201cIt offends against the right of freedom of political expression that\u2019s been implied in the constitution,\u201d Wright said.\nAccording to a map provided by NSW police in arrest documents, the 2km exclusion zone includes Central Station and parts of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One protester was told to attend the Downing Centre court, but that court falls within their exclusion zone.\n\u201cIt is likely to affect people\u2019s ability to go about their lawful business, study and earn a living,\u201d Wright said. \u201cHow can you go to court? You are going to the Downing Centre local court to answer the charges, but you are not allowed to be in that area. It is an absurd condition, it will be challenged and I have faith in the courts that they will make a sensible decision.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, NSW Greens senator David Shoebridge said the bail conditions were so extreme police \u201cknew they would be thrown out of court\u201d. Many protestors who challenged their bail conditions in court had them removed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only unusual, but it is very clearly politically motivated,\u201d he said.\nAn arrested protester, Lily Campbell, said she was held for 27 hours, and refused food for 17 hours, as the police tried to convince her to sign the bail conditions.\nShe also alleged wardens made veiled threats of violence.\n\u201cThe warden in the jail that I was sent to called us \u2018fuckwits\u2019 and said that if his children did this, he would beat them.\u201d \n\u201cThe magistrate has now released me with no bail conditions whatsoever, because I have been arrested and charged with a minor charge of refusing to comply with a police instruction.\u201d\nIn arrest documents, NSW police determined that protesters \u201cif released from custody, will endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community [and] interfere with witnesses or evidence\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy.\n\u201cThe people [arrested] are very well aware that if you are disrupting traffic that will invoke a police response. People are not surprised to hear these are arrestable offences.\n\u201cThe question really is, if the government wants us to stop \u2013 whether that is the school kids or people doing banner drops \u2013 they have a very simple and clear path to do that.\n\u201cNobody is doing this for fun. We are doing it for a purpose, and that is for the government to snap out of it.\u201d\nLudlam said he had applied to have two of his bail conditions struck out, which would be heard by a judge tomorrow.\nAlso on Wednesday on Channel 10\u2019s Studio 10 program, TV host Kerri-Anne Kennerley called for Extinction Rebellion protesters to be \u201cused as speed bumps\u201d.\n\u201cThe guy hanging from the Story Bridge [in Brisbane].

He wants the subject to \u201cflare in the chests\u201d of his audience rather than be lost to abstraction.\nThe first version of You\u2019re Safe Til 2024 was presented over the weekend at Sydney\u2019s Griffin theatre company. Finnigan\u2019s new work is in essence a lecture he hopes will be inspiring in its own lo-fi way, which he breaks up by dancing to pop songs nominated by his scientist interviewees as inspirational, including cuts from Alanis Morissette and Faithless, played on stage by DJ Reuben Ingall. Later, by email, Finnigan says he nominated the year 2024 because \u201cit\u2019s the year my niece turns 18\u201d, something he doesn\u2019t explain in the show. \u201cIn a lot of ways, she\u2019s the person this piece is to and about.\u201d\nNeither a scientist nor, he says, a climate activist, Finnigan\u2019s concern with future generations began when he grew up with lots of science books in the family home as the son of a CSIRO micrometeorologist. His father would open doors for Finnigan to talk to other scientists ahead of an infamous earlier stage project, which the playwright perhaps unwisely called Kill Climate Deniers, the satirical story of an ecowarrior attack on the Australian parliament.\nBefore it even had been staged, the title sent conservative News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt into a predictable rage over taxpayer funding of the script\u2019s development, sparking a chain of indignation to rightwing United States media outlets. Finnigan responded by working the punditry outrage into his final script, but not before being assailed with online death threats, such as suggestions to change the title: \u201cWhat about, Kill David Finnigan?\u201d\nDespite attempts to muzzle it, Kill Climate Deniers has had a long and varied life, constantly retooled and reinvented as a radio play, a stealthy audio tour of parliament, a performance lecture-DJ set and, finally, a funny, well-received play with a mostly-female cast in Sydney, with Australian comedian Felicity Ward set to take it to London in June.\nNow, after all the fireworks have died down, Finnigan is back on stage himself, alighting on the humble chicken to illustrate the concept of the great acceleration of human impact on the planet that began in the second half of the 20th century.\nConsider, he says, that the average weight of a chicken in 1945 was 1.4kg. Today, the average is 5.2kg; a four-fold, hormone-boosted growth over the lifetime of a human being. Over the same period, the chicken population has risen from 18 million to 23 billion. Many years from now, Finnigan predicts, archaeologists will find trillions of fossilised chicken bones discarded from our era.\nBut the playwright says he has learned the lessons he gleaned from the advice of the Climate Communication Project, such as don\u2019t preach about the meat we eat, and don\u2019t overload with facts and figures. He certainly doesn\u2019t admonish the substantial number of audience members who raise their hands when prompted to admit they have run over wildlife \u2013 several kangaroos and even one wombat \u2013 as a neat way of demonstrating animal habitat destruction.\nFinnigan then pours some sand through a sieve, just like professor of ecotoxicology Tamara Galloway of the University of Exeter did with sand from the presumed pristine Galapagos Islands, finding countless tiny bright microplastics washed up from the ocean. Each of us is full of plastic more than any previous human generation, Finnigan notes, thanks to our waste making its way into the ocean food chain.\nNext, to illustrate the future if we don\u2019t act to mitigate climate change, Finnigan asks us to consider the Titanic\u2019s disastrous striking of the iceberg in 1912, when more than 1,500 people drowned, and lifeboats were in short supply. Passengers in the lower classes were much more likely to die than those in first class.\nThe Hollywood film version (spoiler alert) has Kate Winslet\u2019s character, a first-class passenger, survive, while Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays a \u201cplucky young scamp in steerage\u201d, drowns.\nAnd so it goes with the catastrophic future impact of climate change. \u201cThe human race is not going to be extinct,\u201d says Finnigan, before pointing to the largely white, middle-class audience. \u201cWe are Kate Winslet.\u201d\nSmall wonder then that, with our collective privilege, Finnigan finally abandons the idea of being our inspirational guru, after showing some cheesy pictures of children installing solar panels \u2013 his interpretation of the Climate Communication Project\u2019s advice for instilling hope about the pending climate meltdown.\nIt is then that the whole exercise clicks. We need to shake ourselves out of our torpor, our \u201cnumb despair\u201d, whether we\u2019re activists or people simply not too selfish in a neoliberal economy to care for future generations. We don\u2019t need to panic, nor do we have to be too scientifically literate to grasp the urgency of the matter, nor do we necessarily need stories about geese being sucked into the engines of planes that belch carbon as we head to our next holiday.\nInstead, we need to lead by example in our own lives by consuming less, voting for those with the planet\u2019s future in mind, and demanding that they follow through by prioritising the environment, reducing our collective carbon footprint and grasping the world as a global community.\n\u201cYou give yourself hope,\u201d Finnigan concludes, and he\u2019s right. \u201cYou make yourself useful.\u201d\n\u2022 You\u2019re Safe Til 2024 is at Bunjil Place, Narre Warren in Melbourne May 10 to 12 during the Art + Climate = Change Festival\n\u2022 This article originally stated that the cast of Kill Climate Deniers was female only.

Exercise helped me tackle it\u2019\nWell before the end of his first archery lesson three years ago, it was clear Ben Wood [not his real name] possessed excellent hand-eye coordination but, after only a few months\u2019 tuition, he began hitting previously unimaginable bullseyes.\nMeeting such targets had nothing to do with bows and arrows. Then aged 14, Wood\u2019s autistic spectrum disorder meant he had previously found taking part in sports and social activities immensely challenging.\n\u201cBen had tried many different activities but the noise, or the failure of other children to follow the rules, always limited his enjoyment,\u201d says his mother, Julie. \u201cAs his anxieties grew, he stopped attending.\u201d\nBut through a charity offering bespoke sporting sessions, Ben has not only improved his physical fitness, but his emotional wellbeing, too. Operating in Newcastle upon Tyne and across the north-east, uS helps 12 to 25-year-olds with mental health and emotional wellbeing issues improve their quality of life through physical activity.\n\u201cThe charity approved funding for private archery lessons, but the first session was almost too much. His stress levels were sky high and he was beginning to melt down,\u201d says Julie. \u201cHowever, the trainers were amazing \u2013 and by the end of that session, Ben was hitting the target every time he shot.\u201d\nFounded by consultant psychiatrist Dr Mary Jane Tacchi and Yvonne Hurlow, an education and training expert, the activities uS offers include yoga, boxercise, circus skills, horse riding, archery, dance and ice-skating. The charity\u2019s founders say Ben is just one success story: so far, the charity has helped just under 250 young people. Independent analysis of its results is planned for next year.\nFunded by the Barbour Foundation, local businesses and donations, young people are referred to uS by local services such as GPs, hospitals, children\u2019s services, schools and Barnardo\u2019s. They are then assessed and matched to activities. Sessions are mostly taught one-to-one or in a small group with specially trained tutors. The sessions take place at a range of local centres, gyms and riding schools so that young people can continue attending once financial and emotional support from the charity is over. Length of funding varies, but it often lasts for more than one year.\nTacchi says the charity is meant to complement existing NHS services. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to replace treatment but as an adjunct,\u201d she says. Yet she also acknowledges there is a lot of unmet need. One in eight children and young people in England aged between 5 and 19 have a diagnosable mental health disorder; less than one in three of them get access to NHS care and treatment. And 2018 figures from the Education Policy Institute show that Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS foundation trust has the second longest median waiting times for treatment, at 145 days from referral to treatment \u2013 and children\u2019s services funding in the north-east has been cut by one-third since 2010.\n\u201cMental ill-health can have devastating consequences and uS is trying to make a difference,\u201d says one of the charity\u2019s patrons, Olympic gold medallist Steve Cram.\nFor Lauren Head, 19, from Tyneside, yoga has really helped her mental health. \u201cBeing a carer is hard; the pressure and stress placed on you in an already tough situation is a lot to handle,\u201d she says. \u201cI never had time to myself until uS introduced me to yoga. Sometimes having that weekly session to look forward to kept me going.\u201d\nEmilia Allen, 25, also from Tyneside, who has autism, says she did not enjoy sport at school. \u201cI had no confidence and suffered from anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cI always felt excluded, made to feel I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Now, after a year\u2019s boxercise with a personal trainer, funded by uS, she says she has much more self-esteem. \u201cI have been on the scheme for a year now,\u201d she says. \u201cMy confidence has increased \u2013 and I enjoy myself.\u201d Back in Newcastle, Ben, now 17, is much happier, says Julie. \u201cThe difference in him today \u2013 the positive impact on his confidence and coping strategies \u2013 is astounding. He has fewer meltdowns. His life\u2019s changed for the better.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-224": {"text": "Think you\u2019ll dodge a painful political choice?

The only way, it seems, to stop one extremist in #NeverNeverLand is to vote for another. The only way to save #NeverNeverLand from a rightwing disaster is to vote for a leftwing disaster. If you believe in fairies, Peter Pan says clap your hands and Tinker Bell won\u2019t die. When set against what the British are being asked to believe in the general election campaign, belief in fairies sounds modest.\nIn a plea that might have been made by the anti-fascists of the 1930s, the Jewish Chronicle asked all citizens to walk in the shoes of British Jewry and not vote for Jeremy Corbyn. It asked: \u201cHow can the racist views of a party leader \u2013 and the deep fear he inspires among an ethnic minority \u2013 not be among the most fundamental of issues?\u201d So devoutly does the former Labour minister Ian Austin believe in #NeverCorbyn that he is telling \u201cdecent, traditional, patriotic Labour voters\u201d to support Boris Johnson at this election.\nThe trouble is that #NeverCorbyn and #NeverBrexit are incompatible. In many constituencies, the only way to stop Brexit is to vote for the Labour candidate, assuming he or she is an honourable pro-European, which, looking at the thugs and fruit loops Labour is offering the citizenry, may be an assumption too far. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Greens have vowed to unite to defend our membership of the EU. But their offer to put forward unity candidates is redeemable in only 60 seats.\nElsewhere, the Lib Dems will fight to destroy the few decent members of the parliamentary Labour party left: Rosie Duffield in Canterbury, for example, and Neil Coyle in Southwark. Labour supporters, meanwhile, will punish the Lib Dems for austerity rather than stand aside in the interest of removing Jacob Rees-Mogg in Somerset or Dominic Raab in Surrey.\nPeople cling to their tribe, however ugly and dangerous its leader is. This is Johnson and Corbyn\u2019s best hope\nThe absurdity of Britain\u2019s position was captured by the young political writer Adam Barnett. Millions will reluctantly say #NeverCorbyn and support Johnson, while accepting that he lies as easily as others breathe. \u201cVote for the liar because he will deliver on his promises\u201d will be their slogan. Millions will reluctantly say #NeverBrexit and support Corbyn, even though they know he is an ally of racists who has supported Brexit since entering parliament. \u201cVote for the Brexiter antisemite to stop Brexit and deliver social justice\u201d will be theirs.\nThe propaganda of emotional blackmailers is already everywhere. If you don\u2019t vote for Corbyn, you hate the poor. If you don\u2019t vote for Johnson, you love the suicide bombers. I want to emphasise instead how hard it is to persuade voters to defend their society by switching their votes. We have two possible futures: one that contains a fleeting flash of hope and a second that is thoroughly miserable but is no more than we deserve.\nPacts against extremists can be organised, as long as there is only one of them. Twice this century, the French left has swallowed all its principles except the most important principle of all: the need to stop the far right seizing control of the republic. In the 2002 presidential election, under the stirring slogan \u201cVote for a crook, not for a fascist\u201d, it supported the conservative Jacques Chirac and stopped Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme-right Front National, becoming president. In 2017, the left backed Emmanuel Macron against Marine Le Pen. Anyone who finds comparisons with the French far right offensive should consider that Ms Le Pen has watched the Brexit disaster that Johnson and Nigel Farage brought and concluded that advocating French withdrawal from the EU was too extreme a policy for even the French far right to endorse. Meanwhile, Corbyn has engaged with antisemites as gruesome as any the Front National supported. \nThe conservatives of the #NeverTrump movement tried to imitate the French left in the 2016 US presidential elections. Trump was a pornographic slob, a sociopath and a clear and present danger to the US constitution, they warned. Every word was true. The logic of their argument was that moderate conservatives had to vote for Hillary Clinton. They didn\u2019t in sufficient numbers, for a reason that bears on the British crisis. However absurd their judgment appeared to outsiders, too many conservatives regarded Clinton as just as extreme as Trump.\nIf enough Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists win, they can limit Johnson or Corbyn\u2019s worst excesses\nOnce that view has taken hold, people cling to their tribe, however ugly and dangerous its leader is. This is Johnson and Corbyn\u2019s best hope. They want their nervous supporters to be scared into voting for them for fear of the other.\nBritain does not face a binary choice. After Johnson\u2019s purge, the Tory benches will be full of hard-faced hacks determined to impose Brexit, whatever the cost. Momentum will ensure the next batch of Labour MPs will contain more incontinent cranks than any country deserves. We are about to elect a parliament of freaks and fanatics. If, however, enough Lib Dems, Greens and nationalists win, they can act as a blocking minority that will limit Johnson or Corbyn\u2019s worst excesses.\nBut there I go, playing fantasy politics. The fate of the #NeverTrump movement shows the likely fate of Britain. David Frum, one of its doughtiest spokesmen, tells me the experience of Trump in power is giving it a belated vindication. In the midterms and last week\u2019s elections in Pennsylvania and Virginia, it was not just young, educated voters and minorities who voted against Trump but wealthy suburbs that remain in many other respects conservative.\nOn this reading, Britain will have to experience a Johnson Brexit or a Corbyn government before enough voters turn against them.

In some cases similar comments were also made in the commentators\u2019 News Corp columns.\nIn a June event at the University of New South Wales, Pitman told an audience there was \u201cno link between climate change and drought\u201d.\nHe told Guardian Australia: \u201cI misspoke \u2013 I missed a word in my statement and that\u2019s my fault.

The lockdown represented almost 5% of the region\u2019s population and removed a significant proportion of its workforce, leaving GP clinics to fill the gap.\nWhile a passenger from the Ruby Princess cruise shop is thought to be the origin of the north-west outbreak, it does not explain how the infection then spread so rapidly and widely throughout the hospitals between staff, patients and wards, Jacobson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for us to determine when it was known there was a virus outbreak at the hospital and to find out which work areas people contracted it in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a significant level of secrecy around this from the department and the government.\n\u201cAs we move closer to reopening the hospitals people are confused about the circumstances about getting back to work, even simple things like rostering and the provision of personal protective equipment haven\u2019t been communicated, or the cleaning that\u2019s to be undertaken in their work areas.\nMassive distances are now being covered by ambulance. Paramedics from the south and north are working overtime\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful and disgraceful that the department hasn\u2019t put the systems in place to ensure those workers sent home receive information, or even a courtesy call from managers to ask how they are and if they need anything.\u201d\nGuardian Australia contacted the state\u2019s health minister, Sarah Courtney, for comment but did not receive a response. On Thursday the premier, Peter Gutwein, said four more cases connected to the north-west outbreak had been identified overnight. More than 200 cases have been confirmed across the state since the pandemic began. Tighter restrictions in the north-west as a result of the cluster, that were due to be lifted on Sunday, were likely to remain in place for an extra week, Gutwein said. Schools are unlikely to reopen as planned. The testing threshold is also lower in the region.\nThe state\u2019s public health unit told Guardian Australia an interim epidemiological report of the outbreak was almost complete.\n\u201cEpidemiological and microbiological analyses are expected to provide further understanding of the sources and patterns of transmission of coronavirus in this outbreak,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThis is a complex process and does take time to deliver accurate findings.\u201d\nThe emergency department of the public hospital reopened on 17 April, but is not admitting patients. The maternity ward will be reopened next, with a date not yet confirmed. Patients in the two hospitals were transferred to the Mersey Community hospital. Most new patients requiring admission are in the meantime being sent to Launceston hospital or, if they need high-level care, Hobart. But it takes more than 1.5 hours to drive from Burnie, where the north-west hospitals are located, to Launceston, and almost four hours to drive to Hobart.\nHow did it get out of control in the first place and what procedures should have been in place that weren\u2019t?\n\u201cMassive distances are now being covered by ambulance,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThere is also a major problem with ambulance resourcing. There was a rescue package allocated to the ambulance service but we don\u2019t have the bodies on the ground to pick up all those extra shifts to cover the workload in north-west. Paramedics from the south and north are working overtime where they can to meet the north-west paramedics along the route and take over. Fatigue is an issue.\u201d\nSenator for Tasmania Jacqui Lambie says it is likely several factors will be found to have led to the devastating cluster.\n\u201cHow did it get out of control in the first place and what procedures should have been in place that weren\u2019t? What happened between the Ruby Princess passenger becoming sick and being in hospital?\u201d Lambie said people in the region of Burnie were particularly vulnerable to the virus, with a large elderly population and people in poor health.\n\u201cWe have a fairly high unemployment rate, we have fourth-generation welfare recipients, and we know people on welfare often don\u2019t have the best health outcomes,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cWe are among the oldest, poorest and sickest in the country.\u201d\nInfection control procedures will be examined as part of the public health investigation into how the virus took hold. Golden staph infections acquired in hospitals are one of the indicators health departments use to examine how strong a hospital\u2019s infection control procedures are. While private hospitals are not required to report this data, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data for 2018 show Tasmanian public hospital infection rates were well below the national benchmark of two cases per 10,000 patient days. The North-West Regional hospital has the lowest rate in the state.\nHowever, there have been serious concerns raised about how some hospitals have handled aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In late March, a unit manager from Launceston general hospital told staff in an email to \u201ccollect all used, undamaged and unsoiled P2 masks\u201d so the masks could be investigated for reuse. But P2 masks are recommended for single use only.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Sunday, almost three weeks later, that the Tasmanian health service issued a notice to all staff clarifying the masks were being collected as part of a trial to see if they could be successfully decontaminated, but were not to be reused, and that there was sufficient mask stock.\nAustralian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmanian branch secretary, Emily Shepherd, said \u201cit does appear there was a miscommunication in terms of the rationale for collecting the masks\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s now been very firmly clarified,\u201d she said.\nBut Jacobson, from the health services union, is sceptical. \u201cWe raised the issue weeks ago and it\u2019s only after media attention the email went out clarifying what the masks were to be collected for, so that makes me suspicious and cynical,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, there has been a lack of clarity.\u201d\nShepherd and Jacobson both say doctors, nurses, paramedics and other health staff have been through a traumatic time. Blame incorrectly assigned to the health workers by the prime minister added to this distress.

Since then, I\u2019ve played in about 1,600 matches and scored well over 400 goals. The game I most remember was a local derby for Sherborne Town against another Sherborne side. I scored a hat-trick, but I also broke the goalkeeper\u2019s thumb with a shot. You never forget a hat-trick. I scored another when I was 65.\nWhen I go on the pitch, I always say to the opposition, \u201cI\u2019m getting on a bit, but treat me as a normal player. Tackle me hard, I don\u2019t mind, because I\u2019ll be doing it to you.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be treated as an old person. And one or two do come in hard, and sometimes they\u2019ve come off worse. One of my nicknames is The Tank. I\u2019ve never been a dirty player, mind you.\nI have a routine to keep fit. Every evening before bed, I go to the window and take in 10 really, really deep breaths of fresh air. And I do the same thing in the morning \u2013 10 breaths of fresh air, really holding it in my lungs. Living in Weymouth, we have lovely sea air. But wherever I am, I do this routine.\nAnd I\u2019m strict with my diet. I live alone and I know what food is good for me and what isn\u2019t. Certain foods suit the body. I\u2019m disciplined, too. When I have a cup of tea, I take just one biscuit from the tin. I wouldn\u2019t think about taking any more. Discipline, desire, dedication, determination and drive: I\u2019ve tried to conduct my life by those five Ds.\nDiscipline, desire, dedication, determination and drive : I\u2019ve tried to conduct my life by those five Ds\nPlaying football does make me feel young. People say, \u201cYou\u2019re never that age.\u201d Getting older is not a nice thing. I also play keyboards and sing in the pubs and clubs, and one of my gigs is at a rest home where there are obviously a lot of elderly people. I think, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to get like that.\u201d\nPeople have asked if I\u2019d play walking football. It\u2019s fine for those who can\u2019t run very quickly, but it\u2019s not for me. For as long as I can run around at a reasonable pace, I won\u2019t attempt walking football. I want to play the game at the rate it should be played. I was a precision engineer by trade and we were on piece work; the quicker you worked, the more bonus you earned. It\u2019s an in-built thing for me. I\u2019ve never slowed down.\nThe difficulty I\u2019ve had in the past few years is finding a team. Veterans\u2019 teams are constantly folding, including the team I signed for a couple of seasons ago. On the Thursday, the manager had 14 players available; but by the Sunday, only eight were available. He just said, \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m finished with veteran footballers. You\u2019re not reliable.\u201d \nSo I\u2019m without a club at the moment. Veterans football has become very competitive compared to 10 years ago, and I don\u2019t want to play for cups and medals. I want to play in a competitive game, yes, but with the social side of it afterwards \u2013 food laid on, talk about the game, have a couple of pints. I miss the banter. In one pub, we even had a post-match singalong around the piano.\nI\u2019m still available. There\u2019s no question about that.\nI came to England from Jamaica in 1959 as a fast bowler, to play professionally for Crompton Cricket Club in the Central Lancashire League. They paid me \u00a3300 for the summer, but I had to pay my own air fare to come over. My first impression of England? That it was cold! The standard here was very good. I played that summer, then came back again the next summer and finally settled here in 1961.\nI\u2019ve played with and against some legends, including Gary Sobers, Frank Worrell and Wes Hall. They also played professionally in Lancashire during the summer. Sobers played in the Central Lancashire League at the same time as me.\nI played for Lancashire over-50s until I was 70; now I play for Uppermill 2nd XI. We\u2019ve got about five youngsters in the team, as well as me, and someone else who\u2019s 75. I\u2019ve played in the same team as my son, too. He\u2019d bowl from one end and I\u2019d be bowling from the other.\nI played 32 matches last summer and took roughly 30 wickets\nThe opposition probably think, \u201cI don\u2019t want that old man to get me out,\u201d so they up their game a little. My bowling is a little slower these days, but I still know how to get people out. I played 32 matches last summer and took roughly 30 wickets. One thing that annoyed me: in our final match I was on a hat-trick, but as I ran in to bowl, I slipped.\nHonestly, though, I don\u2019t keep a close eye on how many wickets I\u2019ve taken. I\u2019m there to enjoy the game, like everybody else. Some fellas I know keep telling me, \u201cI did this and I did that and I\u2019ve got these trophies,\u201d and all that. I\u2019ve got trophies but I don\u2019t crow about them. Even as a professional, I didn\u2019t count up how many wickets I\u2019d taken over a season. My wife keeps a scrapbook and I was looking through it yesterday. It says that way back in the 1980s, I had taken 1,780 wickets. I\u2019ve taken a lot more now. Someone said more than 2,000.\nI don\u2019t have a special diet. When I get an injury, I don\u2019t cry off \u2013 I try to play through it. I\u2019ve played a match with a pulled hamstring before and just rested it after. I stay active outside the cricket season, coaching the kids at the club. And I play bowls, too.\nCricket\u2019s in my blood, ever since I played barefoot back home in Jamaica as a kid. Everyone asks, \u201cWhen are you going to finish?\u201d I always tell them that I\u2019ll wait to see what happens next year. I feel well at the moment. I think I\u2019ll just keep going.\nI started road running when it became popular about 30 years ago. It was the London Marathon that made me want to \u2013 not that I intended to run a marathon. Running was something I really wanted to do but I was a bit nervous. I felt embarrassed. I thought the neighbours would think, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d Nowadays there are loads of women runners out on the road, but back then it was rather unusual.\nOne day, I plucked up the courage and ran round the block. I started out rather casually, as though I was running for the bus, and then sped up after I went round the corner. I huffed and puffed, but when I got back, I thought, \u201cI love this. I want to go again.\u201d\nMy first race was a 4km fun run. It was a team event, so I got a few people at work together. Most viewed it as a one-off, but my friend and I carried on afterwards. The following year, we did our first London Marathon together. We didn\u2019t really have a training schedule; we ran five miles on weekdays, but added an extra mile to our longer Sunday run each week. We built up that way.\nIt is good for relieving stress. When my husband was ill, I\u2019d come home from hospital and go for a run\nThat first marathon was tough. I reached the last few miles and said to myself, \u201cIf I finish this, I will never do anything this stupid again.\u201d Then I ran it the following year and have done another 16 since then. I didn\u2019t keep to that very well, did I? All have been the London Marathon, except for the time I ran the Lochaber one. That was beautiful, but very different: there was barely a soul about, and it was like a very long training run. London does get crowded. Everyone\u2019s running on your heels and you\u2019re running on others\u2019 heels. I still think it\u2019s the best, though.\nI did it in 2018 because I wanted to be the oldest woman, which I was. I won my age group, too \u2013 but I still didn\u2019t get a place in the 2019 race [414,000 people entered the ballot; there are only about 17,000 places]. How unfair is that?\nI\u2019ve tried track running, but going round in circles doesn\u2019t do it for me. I tried the treadmill in the gym, but I could see the park through the window. I thought: \u201cWhat am I doing in here? Why am I not running out there?\u201d\nI still run four times a week. Having friends at my running club who are younger than me makes me feel younger. It is also good for relieving stress. When my husband was ill, I\u2019d come home from hospital and go for a run \u2013 it was therapeutic.\nI want to run marathons until 2020, at which point I\u2019ll be 85. That might be the end of the marathons, I think. But not running \u2013 I won\u2019t give up running.\nI didn\u2019t start playing table tennis until I was in my 20s; before that, I was playing county level tennis. I stopped playing when I had children and didn\u2019t return for many years. But when I went back to work, I took it up again: there happened to be a table there. I played at lunchtimes and one of the men asked if I could be a reserve for their local league team.\nI didn\u2019t play seriously until I started competing in veterans\u2019 tournaments when I was 50. I was free from looking after the children by then. The first tournament I can remember was in Coventry, where I won the over-40s. The woman I beat was 42. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind being beaten by a 40-year-old, but not a 50-year-old!\u201d\nThe first big tournament I won was the Veterans European Championships in Vienna in 1995, when I was 65. I won the over-60s and beat the then world champion and a previous world champion. I\u2019ve become world champion myself since, but I still think the first was my biggest win. I\u2019d never won anything like that before. They played the national anthem and I received a bouquet and a huge cup.\nTable tennis has taken me to places I would never have visited otherwise. I\u2019ve played all over the world\nTable tennis has taken me to places I would never have visited. I\u2019ve played all over the world. My husband wasn\u2019t a keen traveller, but I travelled with a group of veterans. I liked China very much \u2013 I won the over-80s singles and doubles there. I thought Rio was exotic. Canada was wonderful.\nI was disappointed at the world championships in Las Vegas last June. I was defending the title I won two years previously in Alicante, but lost to a Japanese player in the semi-final. It was very close \u2013 16-14 in the final game \u2013 so I only got the bronze. They don\u2019t play national anthems these days because there\u2019s no time. It\u2019s an enormous event. In Vegas, there were 150 tables in one room and 5,000 players! I\u2019ve possibly got my eye on the over-90s title at the next world championships in 2020. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nI don\u2019t think table tennis gets enough publicity in this country. It\u2019s much more affordable than buying a set of golf clubs; you can pay as little as \u00a320 for a good bat. And then there are the health benefits. King\u2019s College London did an experiment with several activities for the elderly, and table tennis came out well. As well as the physical movement, there\u2019s the rapid eye movement and concentration, which is supposed to help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia.\nI was honoured to receive an MBE for services to table tennis. My family were stunned. Prince Charles made the award. I\u2019ve never been impressed with him on the news, but he was charming. He asked if I was still playing. When I said I was, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to take you on today.\u201d\nWhat started me off was my father buying me a lightweight bike when he was demobbed. He had been a cyclist before the war, so it was in the blood. My first race was as a 20-year-old in a 50-mile time trial in Northumberland; I was the fastest novice, which fuelled my enthusiasm.\nI won the Veterans\u2019 Road Race World Championship in Austria in 1997 when I was 70. I was up against former professionals. On the Monday, I won the world championship and on the Wednesday I became the European Masters champion. I won by three or four lengths at both events. I\u2019ve got photos of my finishes, with my one-armed victory salute \u2013 a bit like Alan Shearer! I got two huge cups for those races. I\u2019ve got trophies galore and more than 100 medals.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve ridden many 12-hour time trials, and at the age of 80 I was determined to do a 24-hour one. I lost an hour and a half to sickness, but I still broke the record for an 80-year-old. I covered 326 miles in that time. And I crashed near the finish, too.\nI still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bike\nI still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bikeI\u2019ve nearly killed myself on numerous occasions. When I was about 60, I had a nasty accident in Northumberland. I was coming up to a junction and there was no marshal around. I hadn\u2019t seen that a wagon had stopped. I hit it at about 25mph and landed in the middle of the road. I broke my collarbone, punctured my lung and had to have a plate put into my left arm. And when I was 73, I was nearly killed in Thailand. A van hit me head-on and left me bleeding at the side of the road. I had to have 29 stitches in my head.\nThe secret of my longevity? I had a very long-living mother who died only a week before her 99th birthday. Other than that, I\u2019ve led a normal life. We didn\u2019t have the supplements we have today. I wasn\u2019t living on just bread and jam, but it was a simple diet.\nI still do between 150-180 miles a week on the bike. Fortunately, living in Northumberland, the roads are quiet. But the real handicap \u2013 whether I\u2019m heading out north, south, east or west \u2013 is that I\u2019ve got to climb straight away. And you\u2019re starting from cold, which is not good.\nCycling has never been as popular as running, but the social aspect has gone completely. When I go out on a Sunday, the most I see riding together are two or three riders. At one time, we might have had up to 60 doing a club run.\nEveryone recognises me because I wear my original club colours. And I don\u2019t wear a helmet. Never have \u2013 only when I\u2019ve been racing. \n\u2022 Commenting on this piece?

The MP has called on the major parties to bring the bill to the floor and allow a conscience vote.\nCannon-Brookes said the proposal contained all the elements of a viable settlement to the climate wars. \u201cThe legislated 2050 target and five-year increments are precisely what is required, and the bill deserves bipartisan support.\u201d\nCannon-Brookes has been vocal in support of climate action in Australia, and has supported independents through Climate 200 \u2013 an environmental lobby group also supported by Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court. But he has not played a hands-on role in drafting the current proposal.\nSarah McNamara, the Australian Energy Council\u2019s chief executive, said Steggall\u2019s bill was a considered attempt to find a workable framework and had the potential to move the country beyond the climate policy impasse.\n\u201cWe would encourage that it be carefully considered and calmly assessed,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt offers the potential for much-needed certainty and a clear path forward not just for the energy industry, but for the Australian economy. For our part we will be consulting with our members in the coming weeks to assess the bill in detail.\u201d\nIt follows a declaration by the Business Council of Australia that Australia should work to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\nIndependent MP Zali Steggall \u2013 along with her fellow crossbenchers Rebekah Sharkie, Helen Haines and Andrew Wilkie \u2013 is seeking bipartisan support for a climate change framework bill aimed at transitioning Australia to a decarbonised economy.\u00a0\nThis is what's in it.\n\u2022 Aims to limit global warming to well below 2C,\u00a0pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\u2022 Net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.\n\u2022 To achieve the target, the minister creates an emissions budget.\n\u2022 Establishes a Climate Change Commission to prepare a national climate change risk assessment every five years.\n\u2022 The commission is made up of a chair, Australia's chief scientist and five other members \u2013 who must have experience in either climate science, business, agriculture, environmental management, energy, transport or regional development.\n* The assessments cover the risks climate change poses to the economy, society, agriculture, environment and ecology.\n\u2022 In response, the minister creates a national adaptation plan.\n\u2022 The commission provides the minister with yearly adaptation plan progress reports.\n\u2022 Decisions made under the Act must be based on the best available science.\n\u2022 It abolishes the current Climate Change Authority, with the commission to take its place.\nWhile the BCA has at times in its history has been riven on climate action, and has actively stymied progress, the organisation\u2019s chief executive Jennifer Westacott told the ABC on Monday night the time had now come to deliver policy certainty.\n\u201cI reckon if we could get the two political parties to agree to that and legislate it, we would have made a massive advance in this country because we would know where we\u2019re going,\u201d Westacott said.\nWhile the BCA in 2018 described Labor\u2019s more ambitious 2030 emissions reduction target as \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d, in 2019 it joined other groups in representing industry, unions, farmers and investors under the Australian Climate Roundtable banner in calling for policies that could put it on a path to net zero emissions.\nOn Monday night, Westacott characterised the Steggall proposal as \u201csensible\u201d.\nSteggall\u2019s bill will not be brought on for debate unless either the government or Labor supports it reaching the floor of the House. The government has not yet made a decision but it is unlikely to support it.\nOn Tuesday morning, the Labor leader Anthony Albanese said it was highly unlikely the bill would be voted on \u201cbecause that\u2019s what happens with private member\u2019s bills in the House of Representatives, unless the government agrees to allocate time for the bill, it will not be voted on\u201d.\nAlbanese said the proposal was very well intentioned, and he \u201crespected\u201d Steggall for bringing it forward, but told the ABC \u201cwe are unlikely to have a conscience vote on climate change. What we\u2019ll do is support action on climate change.\u201d\nThe Labor leader said the opposition would commit to a long-term emissions reduction target \u201cvery soon\u201d and, referencing an internal split within the Coalition about taxpayer backing for new coal plants, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a place for new coal-fired power plants in Australia. Full stop.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Labor\u2019s deputy leader Richard Marles, in a particularly awkward interview, did not rule out the party supporting new coal developments, saying it would be a decision for the markets despite previously declaring it would be a \u201cgood thing\u201d if the thermal coal market collapsed.", "label": 0}, "text-231": {"text": "Don't Apologize for Being Honest about Climate Change\nDouthat placed himself among the lukewarmers and very graciously referred his readers to some of my recent work for a longer discussion of those themes.

In contrast, climate change is a trend change. The impact of a trend is ongoing, whereas a cycle is temporary.\u201d\nHe said there was a need to reassess the frequency of climate change events, and \u201cour assumptions about the severity and longevity of the climatic events\u201d.\nHe said the insurance industry had already recognised the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes in the northern hemisphere had changed, and this reassessment had prompted the sector to reprice how they insure and reinsure against such events.\n\u201cWe need to think about how the economy is currently adapting and how it will adapt both to the trend change in climate and the transition required to contain climate change,\u201d Debelle said.\nHe said the transition path to a less carbon-intensive world was \u201cclearly quite different depending on whether it is managed as a gradual process or is abrupt\u201d.\n\u201cThe trend changes aren\u2019t likely to be smooth. There is likely to be volatility around the trend, with the potential for damaging outcomes from spikes above the trend.\u201d\nDebelle noted the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had provided \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that another half degree of warming was likely in the next 10 to 30 years.\nHe said work from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO pointed to an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, and noted \u201cextreme events may well have a disproportionately large physical impact\u201d.\n\u201cThere is also a greater possibility of compound events, where two or more climatic events combine to produce an outcome that is worse than the effect of one of them occurring individually,\u201d Debelle said.\n\u201cCombined with the increased volatility, this increases the likelihood of nonlinear impacts on the economy.\u201d\nDebelle said assessed through that lens, climate change-induced shocks to the economy would be \u201cclose to permanent\u201d if droughts were more frequent and cyclones happened more often. \u201cThat situation is more challenging to assess and respond to.\u201d\nHe said the impacts of climate change on the economy were mixed both domestically and in terms of export earnings.\nThe deputy governor pointed to the huge transition under way in Australia\u2019s energy sector where the levelised cost of generating electricity had declined in the case of wind and solar \u201cto the point where they are now cost-effective sources of generation\u201d.\nBut he said the massive shift in the direction of rooftop solar had consequences for the cost of electricity transmission and also the efficacy of current infrastructure. He said the RBA was paying close attention to developments in the energy market, \u201cgiven the importance of the cost of electricity in inflation both directly to households and indirectly as a significant input to businesses\u201d.\nDebelle noted there was a move in China to transition to cleaner energy sources.

Eight hundred participants gathered to hear 64 speakers from 12 different countries despite the fierce summer heat of Las Vegas. At one point 4,000 individuals were listening to the conference as it was streamed live from Las Vegas.Speakers addressed myths of climate alarmism, specifically refuting the often-repeated assertion that 97 percent of scientists disagree with so-called global warming skeptics. On the contrary, speakers noted, only 0.5 percent of the authors of 11,944 scientific papers on climate and related topics over the past 21 years have said they agree most of the warming since 1950 was manmade, and that is only one of the necessary preconditions for an asserted global warming crisis. Speakers also cited\u00a0 the Remote Sensing Systems satellite record which shows there now has been no global warming for 17 years and 10 months.Busting MythsDuring the opening dinner, meteorologist Joe Bastardi explained extreme weather events are not becoming any more frequent or severe as the planet warms. To the contrary, Bastardi documented how hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other extreme weather events are declining in frequency and severity. To the extent there are short-term increases in extreme weather events at some places within the overall global decline, Bastardi showed those follow weather and climate patterns that existed long before recent global warming.During the breakfast session on Day 2, Greenpeace cofounder Patrick Moore chronicled the radicalization of once-noble environmentalist groups. Standing before photographs of himself leading environmental protests and provocative actions against whalers and other corporate entitites, Moore explained how Greenpeace and other environmental activist groups are now harming human health and welfare by demanding so many resources be dedicated to the fictitious global warming crisis. True environmental progress would be made fighting for land conservation and other real environmental concerns rather than trumped-up global warming claims, Moore explained.Patrick Michaels, a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and former program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society, explained during the Day 2 luncheon how government research grants are promoting the false notion of an alarmist consensus. Large government research grants are handed out almost uniformly to scientists who will promote the idea of global warming crisis, which ensures more budgetary dollars for government agencies addressing the topic and subsequently more research grants for the participating scientists, he noted.Presenting the ScienceThe breakout sessions featured additional dozens of compelling presentations.Howard Hayden, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Connecticut, demonstrated how all energy sources have environmental drawbacks. Hayden, moreover, showed scientifically how wind, solar, and other renewable power sources simply cannot meet the nation\u2019s energy demands. Wind and solar power require tremendous amounts of land to produce even a very small amount of electricity. Although there may be room for expensive renewable power at the margins, global warming strategies that aim to shut down conventional power will not find enough replacement renewable power to keep the lights on, Hayden demonstrated. True land conservationists, said Hayden, are among the most vocal opponents of wind and solar power facilities.Dr. John Dunn, a medical doctor, attorney, and advisor for the American Council on Science and Health, debunked EPA assertions that restrictions on power plant emissions will save lives and benefit human health. Dunn documented that human mortality rates are much higher during cold spells and winter months than during heat waves and summer months. Addressing EPA\u2019s claims that tangential reductions in particulate matter and other emissions will save lives, Dunn showed that EPA\u2019s assertions are totally unsupported and defy comprehensive health and mortality data. Also worth noting, EPA reports power plant emissions of the Six Principal Pollutants have already declined 70 percent even without EPA\u2019s proposed carbon dioxide restrictions. Existing rules and regulations will reduce those emissions even further, with or without the proposed carbon dioxide restrictions.Heartland Institute Senior Fellow James M. Taylor provided a concise and compelling summary of the scientific evidence for modest instead of severe global warming. Taylor\u2019s presentation, along with all of the ICCC-9 presentations, was videotaped and is available online. Taylor gave a lively 10-minute talk with visual-friendly charts and graphs to share with family, friends, and acquaintances who would like to learn more about the global warming debate.Denying Blessings of ModernityAt the final panel discussion, \"Panel 21: Global Warming as a Social Movement,\" on Wednesday afternoon, the distinguished panelists included E. Calvin Beisner, Ph.D., founder and national spokesman of the Cornwall Alliance; Paul Driessen, J.D., a senior advisor to the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow and Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise; and Peter Ferrara, J.D., a senior fellow of The Heartland Institute. Serving as moderator was Minnesota State Rep. Pat Garofalo.Panelists Beisner, Driessen, and Ferrara all argued climate alarmists tend to be radical environmentalists who view people primarily as polluters and consumers who use up Earth's resources and poison the planet in the process, never seeing free people as voluntarily being good stewards of natural resources. Through the manmade global warming alarm, activists have used governments to deny affordable and reliable energy and other modern blessings to the developing world, panelists noted.\nNancy J.

The 'gut-wrenching' choices facing US health workers\nFrom ambulances to intensive care units, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced American healthcare workers to make \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d decisions about a patient\u2019s fate \u2013 once rare even for hospital ethics committees.\nThose decisions are now made under a new paradigm \u2013 scarcity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not used to this in the United States, where we feel like resources are always available,\u201d said Mildred Z Solomon, the president of the New York-based Hastings Center, one of the world\u2019s leading bioethics thinktanks. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d\nPhysicians in America now practice in an \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d time of shortages many and varied, one ethicist said. The most pressing national concern is lack of ventilators. Medical device analysts predict another 75,000 will be needed across the United States to care for the roughly 10% of Covid-19 patients who need them.\nBut that\u2019s not where it ends. \u201cVentilators are the ones that everyone hears about, but there are so many shortages,\u201d said Dr J Wesley Boyd, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard medical school\u2019s center for bioethics.\nDialysis machines are in high demand as Covid-19 patients go into kidney failure. Doctors are low on supplies of painkillers and sedatives needed for ventilator patients, who have a deeply uncomfortable tube inserted into their mouth and windpipe. And hospitals are already rationing protective equipment and testing swabs.\nTo deal with the unprecedented circumstance, and in the absence of federal guidance, hospitals have formed triage committees to guide life-and-death decisions. While there were instructions on how to categorize patients and allocate critical resources before Covid-19, many of these documents are no longer relevant. New York\u2019s last state guidelines on ventilator allocations are from 2015.\nNow, hospital leadership is appointing new interdisciplinary teams, adapting emergency room triage, and coding patients by their likelihood to survive.\n\u201cTriage will save lives,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cAnd unpleasant as it is to estimate survivability, we could end up using this equipment on people who are going to die anyway, and not offering it to people who could have been saved.\u201d\nAt the University of Pittsburgh school of medicine, decisions will be made by a team of one critical care specialist, an acute care nurse and an administrator. Patients\u2019 own doctors \u201cwill not make triage decisions\u201d and triage will not bar any patients \u2013 such as those with a pre-existing lung condition or disabilities. However, the hospital system will prioritize healthcare workers, in hopes those workers will eventually save more lives.\nThe prospect of triage has led many to question how older people might be treated. Patients aged 70 and older are far more susceptible to Covid-19, and many worry that will put the elderly at a disadvantage to receive life-saving care. But ethicists say that\u2019s not the reality. They said older people could be lower priority for ventilators, but because of a higher likelihood of underlying health conditions, not age.\n\u201cI hope the public will recognize these triage plans are being developed by heartbroken health professions, for whom there\u2019s going to be tremendous suffering and [post-traumatic stress disorder],\u201d said Solomon.\nWhile \u201csurvivability\u201d has emerged as the most widely accepted metric for hospital ethics boards, it is not without critics. Such triage has been described as \u201cdeath panels\u201d, and some argue care should be on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis. Others have argued that underlying health conditions of demographic groups in the United States will lead to disparate treatment in critical situations.\nCritics argue metrics of survivability will prioritize the healthy, and \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d would be fairer. However, many ethicists believe this model is the \u201cmost corruptible\u201d, and will inevitably disadvantage people with less baseline access to healthcare. \u201cPeople who aren\u2019t in the know or don\u2019t have transportation are unlikely to be first in line,\u201d said Solomon.\nMeanwhile, ethicists said they have been excluded from higher-level decision making during this \u201cextraordinary\u201d time. When Donald Trump took office, his administration declined to impanel a national committee on bioethics, breaking a generations-long tradition beginning with President Gerald Ford in 1974.\n\u201cI believe completely that having a panel of experienced bioethicists at the disposal of the president, as President Obama, would have been helpful to the Trump administration,\u201d said Anita Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Carey law school, who also served on President Obama\u2019s bioethics commission. For upheaval similar to that caused by Covid-19, she said, Americans would have to look back to the second world war.\nBoyd went further: \u201cThe response from the federal level has been appalling across every single front.\u201d\nIn the absence of a federal panel, which would have probably begun considering issues of scarcity as early as January, bioethicists have been left to coordinate with states, hospitals and even individual agencies on how to allocate scarce medical resources. More than 1,400 leading bioethicists urged the Trump administration to tackle this issue in mid-March, but the administration only began to heed such advice last week.\nAmid the piecemeal guidance, workers at all levels of the country\u2019s healthcare system are scrambling to stretch their resources on the ground. At the center of the outbreak in New York and New Jersey, hospitals have converted anesthesia and \u201cBiPap\u201d machines (often used by sufferers of sleep apnea) into ventilators.\nPhysicians at hospitals in New York City said that they haven\u2019t yet been provided any specific new guidelines for how to triage or care for new patients. A doctor at Elmhurst hospital, the center of New York\u2019s coronavirus cases, said he has multiple conversations with patients and their families every day about whether or not they should go to the ICU or be put on a ventilator.\nPressure on local hospitals extends past the doors of the emergency rooms. EMT workers in cities such as Paterson, New Jersey, to avoid bringing people to the hospital. There, emergency medical technicians from the local fire department determine whether patients are in such severe respiratory distress that they should come to the emergency room.\nWith the entire health system stretched to its maximum, a patient\u2019s life during the pandemic will depend not just on triage teams at hospitals, but on every health worker in their journey along the way.\n\u201cNow, we have ethics decisions at the bedside, or by the ambulance driver, or the ICU doctor in terms of when is it time to stop,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of medical ethics at New York University\u2019s school of medicine in New York City.\n\u201cFamilies are going to be seeing a loved one die \u2013 not necessarily from Covid \u2013 that normally they would not,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "text-236": {"text": "\u2018Our people are dying\u2019: Australia\u2019s climate confrontation in the Pacific\nIt was always going to be a showdown on the climate crisis.\nAs leaders from the Pacific gathered in Tuvalu for their annual Pacific Islands Forum, there was one subject destined to dwarf all others and which pitted Australia, with its increasing emissions and plans for new coalmines, against its small island neighbours.\nAnd PIF 2019 turned out to be exactly that: a reckoning on the climate emergency confronting the Pacific.\nThere were moving speeches from young Pasifika speaking of their fears for their future, tears in the leaders\u2019 retreat, and accusations that Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, had shown such disrespect toward his counterparts during their marathon 12-hour meeting, that the Fijian prime minister said Pacific countries may be driven further into the arms of China.\nThe choice of location for the forum was significant. Tuvalu, located about two hours on a plane north of Fiji, is one of the countries most at risk. The main island, where the capital, Funafuti, is located, is an ever-decreasing sliver of land, at its narrowest just 20m wide, and just 3m above sea level. It faces a host of problems including salinity of the water table, which makes growing crops extremely difficult, coastal erosion that is seeing islands crumble into the sea, storm surges and rising temperatures.\nYou are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people\nThe event was a huge undertaking for Tuvalu, which is designated as a \u201cleast developed country\u201d and has a population of around 11,000 people. The convention centre, as well as about 75% of accommodation used for the event, was built specifically for the conference, and right up until people started arriving for the forum, Tuvaluans were laying electricity cables, painting, bringing in furniture \u2013 and working in shifts around the clock to get ready. \nTo feed delegates, different communities from Tuvalu\u2019s outer islands took turns preparing and bringing in food, presenting lavish lunches and dinners of crab, lobster, fish, chicken, salads, taro and custard coconut cake. On several nights, large traditional dances or fateles were held, with the different islands taking it in turn to run the night\u2019s entertainment.\nTuvalu\u2019s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told the Guardian ahead of the conference that Tuvalu was seeing the event as an opportunity to showcase its culture \u2013 to show the world what would be lost, apart from land, if Tuvalu were to disappear.\nFrom the opening speech of the climate crisis summit, delivered by Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, held the day before the forum officially opened, it was clear that Pacific leaders had their eyes on one forum member country in particular when it came to climate action.\n\u201cI appeal to Australia to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change,\u201d he said, adding that coal posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Pacific countries.\nWhen Scott Morrison arrived on Wednesday afternoon, he was asked by Sopoaga, as all leaders were, to stop and consider the installation built at the entry to the airport \u2013 a model of an island in distress with a moat around it, in which young children sat.\nGroups of children sang a welcome song: \u201cWe have a problem, we need to solve it, we need to start right now.\u201d Before singing a version of Sopoaga\u2019s famous statement on climate change: \u201cSave Tuvalu to save the world.\u201d\nMorrison\u2019s announcement of $500m in climate resilience and adaptation for the Pacific region on Monday night, while welcomed by Pacific leaders, did not buy Australia much of a reprieve. The next day, Sopoaga said: \u201cNo matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn\u2019t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines.\u201d\nThe main event of the week, the leaders\u2019 retreat, was held on Thursday, with leaders, in the customary matching shirts, sitting down to thrash out the language of a forum communique and climate change statement, that will be used as the basis of regional decision-making.\nAt dawn on the morning of the retreat, as he stood watching an early-morning demonstration of traditional Tuvaluan fishing methods, Sopoaga said he was optimistic and thought negotiations would be wrapped up by lunchtime.\nSopoaga said the fishing method was a good metaphor for what the leaders were trying to do that day: a group of people walk out into the water and advance in a line, slapping and waving palm branches underwater, to frighten the fish which are herded toward the reef and then eventually surrounded by the group who hold hands and advance, trapping them with their bodies before they are scooped up with nets. \n\u201cYou go in unison, you go like a human net. It\u2019s a community thing, it\u2019s a collective. I think that\u2019s the way to address climate change. We must base it on a community approach,\u201d Sopoaga said.\nBut that community was sorely tested throughout Thursday, in a meeting between the leaders that Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister described as \u201cfierce at times\u201d and almost broke down twice, due to Australia\u2019s refusal to budge on certain red lines, including insisting on the removal of mentions of coal, limiting warming to under 1.5C and setting a plan for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\nSopoaga said the next day he had told Morrison at one point during discussions: \u201cYou are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.\u201d\nEmotions ran high, with Sopoaga revealing that at one point during discussions, the Tongan prime minister, Akilisi Pohiva, cried as he reflected on a presentation given by two young women at the climate change summit earlier in the week about their fears for the future.\nPohiva cut a dignified but heartrending figure throughout the week. He attended the summit despite serious health concerns, which he told the Guardian meant this year\u2019s PIF would likely be his last. His frailty was evident, but so too was his deep feeling for Tuvalu, with other leaders speaking of the enormous respect his presence, despite his illness, demonstrated for the region and its concerns.\nAn exhausted Sopoaga eventually emerged from the retreat venue on Thursday night, after almost 12 hours of negotiations, and told the waiting press that an agreement had been reached on the forum communique and climate change statement.\nAustralia had succeeded in watering down the language of the communique, and keeping out any mention of coal and its other \u201cred lines\u201d. But while Australia may have succeeded in softening the language, the means by which it achieved that victory seemed to undermine the government\u2019s much-touted Pacific step-up, in which Canberra seeks to engage more concertedly with the region, particularly in light of China\u2019s increasing interest in it.\nThe Fijian prime minister expressed his anger with how events had unfolded in the leaders\u2019 retreat, telling the Guardian that Morrison had been \u201cvery insulting and condescending\u201d and that his behaviour could lead countries to reject Australia in favour of engagement with China.\n\u201cAfter what we went through with Morrison, nothing can be worse than him,\u201d Bainimarama said.\nAs the accommodation was packed up and the Australian defence force Hercules planes took delegates away, the people of Tuvalu remained, facing the same threats and dangers they did before leaders came to debate what to do about them.\nOn the final night of the forum, a clearly disappointed Sopoaga urged Tuvaluans who were unhappy with the \u201ccompromised\u201d language coming out of the event not to lose hope, and he urged the rest of the world to remember the plight of his people: \u201cWe ask, please understand this, our people are dying.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-237": {"text": "What would a \u2018climate diet\u2019 look like in Australia?\nMillions of people around the world are hitting the streets this year in support of students who are demanding an end to fossil fuels. But we can also strike with our forks: global food production contributes around a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions.\nAustralia was recently flagged as one of the countries with the greatest potential to reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions.\n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) declared that it is crucial for all sectors to rally against global heating, and targets to slow it down simply can\u2019t be achieved without addressing food production and land management.\nEnvironmental degradation also goes hand-in-hand with the global pandemic of chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart disease. This double whammy includes other factors associated with industrial monocrops, such as pesticides and fertiliser.\nSo tweaking dietary habits is a win-win for people and the planet. But just what would a climate-friendly diet look like?\nMeat and dairy are two primary contenders, according to the IPCC \u2013 cattle production is a major source of methane emissions and deforestation. This is particularly relevant for Australians who relish their steaks and sausages \u2013 they are the world\u2019s second biggest meat eaters.\nGiven that more than one in 10 people \u2013 and rising \u2013 is vegetarian some of us are eating an awful lot of animal flesh. In fact, Australian meat consumption has grown from 93kg to nearly 95kg per person each year \u2013 that\u2019s equivalent to everyone eating a very large steak every day.\n\u201cThe mass production of meat is the single biggest cause of land clearing around the world, if not directly for the animals themselves then indirectly for the monocultures such as corn or soy that feed them,\u201d says economist Dr Gillian Hewitson from the University of Sydney.\nSustainability expert Dr Michalis Hadjikakou, from Deakin University, Melbourne, agrees that reducing meat is a good start, but acknowledges radical shifts to vegan or vegetarian diets are difficult for many. For those who struggle, he suggests cutting back on beef and lamb, meats with the biggest environmental footprint.\nOther more sustainable options include kangaroo meat \u2013 which is harvested wild under strict quotas and is becoming increasingly popular. Wild rabbit is another eco-friendly option that is making its way back onto Australian menus.\nInsects such as mealworms and crickets are also climate-friendly alternatives, for those who can stomach them. If not, other viable non-meat protein sources abound, including legumes, nuts, seeds (think quinoa, chia), wholegrains, eggs \u2013 and even nutty-flavoured hemp.\nNew research is making it harder to gloss over dairy\u2019s impact, suggesting that swapping out bacon for haloumi is not much gentler on the planet.\nThe study models country-specific dietary changes that could alleviate our climate, water and health crises.\nOverall, it confirms that bovine, sheep and goat meats have by far the highest environmental impact. But eating certain animal products once a day has a smaller footprint than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets that exclude meats but include dairy foods.\nThe small footprint of this \u201clow-food-chain\u201d diet, in which insects, forage fish and mollusks replaced a large chunk of terrestrial and aquatic animals, was second only to vegan diets.\nIn any event, switching to more plant foods is considered paramount for planetary and human health \u2013 especially as most Australians don\u2019t eat enough of them.\nPlant foods are staples of traditional diets, and the much-researched Mediterranean diet \u2013 rich in vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds, wholegrains and extra virgin olive oil \u2013 delivers multiple health benefits with its kaleidoscope of nutrients and fibre. As a bonus, Australians can grow pretty much anything that thrives in Mediterranean regions \u2013 even in our own backyards \u2013 and research has shown this diet is both viable and easy for Australians to adopt.\nPossibly some of the most sustainable \u2013 and nutritious \u2013 foods could be growing wild in our backyards or footpaths: edible weeds. Most cities even have guided foraging tours to help residents find them. Gardening expert Kate Wall, for instance, runs regular weed workshops in Brisbane that explore which weeds are edible and what can be done with them. \u201cWe have a forage and together we create a three-course meal with drinks, all based on weeds,\u201d she says.\nOver tens of thousands of years, the keen eyes of Indigenous Australians have unearthed this large island\u2019s abundance of nutritious, edible native plants that are adapted to our parched climate. From bush tomatoes and desert limes to Kakadu plums, quandong and riberries, there are potentially thousands of species to be widely adopted.\nEating seasonal foods grown locally and avoiding imported foods can be another way to support the environment. There are, however, some contingencies depending on how it\u2019s grown \u2013 for instance, indoor farms that rely on artificial sunlight may be hyper-local, but they\u2019re not very energy efficient. Locally grown foods also tend to be fresher than transported and stored produce \u2013 and more nutritious, possibly making them even more important than eating organic, according to experts.\nQuality is more important than quantity, says Dr Mario Herrero Acosta, chief research scientist at CSIRO, and IPCC contributor.\nEating less will help maintain a healthy weight and put less pressure on Earth\u2019s resources. The same goes for buying less: about a third of all food produced is never eaten, wasting precious land, water and energy used to produce it. If it were a country, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by food waste would be just behind the US and China.\nThe simplest thing that Acosta thinks people could do right away, therefore, is to \u201ceat and buy mindfully, meaning to eat less discretionary foods and ensure the minimum goes to waste\u201d.\nCutting back on junk foods and drinks \u2013 highly processed products teeming with sugar, salt and unhealthy fats \u2013 would make a big difference, says nutritionist Dr Rosemary Stanton. Tackling these \u201cdiscretionary\u201d items that are unnecessary for a healthy diet is not only critical for human but also planetary health. Hadjikakou calculated that producing junk food contributes to more than a third of Australia\u2019s food-related environmental impact, in terms of their water and land use, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.\nThis also applies to processed vegan foods, adds Stanton, so simply going vegan without considering other health and environmental factors is not a sustainable solution. And although tinned lentils and vegetables are healthier options and considerably more sustainable to grow, cooking them in their whole form would avoid the environmental resources needed to package them.\nAustralia has become a \u201ctakeaway nation\u201d. While we love watching celebrity chefs cook, increasingly Australians shun our own stoves in favour ordering in or going out. In just 10 years, the money Australians spent on eating out doubled to a whopping $3.5 billion.\nReviving home cooking in Australia would promote good health while lowering the destructive impacts of industrial food production and packaging.\nThis is not just for the privileged. While poorer people tend to eat more takeaway and processed food, research shows that a healthy, plant-based diet is not only affordable, but cheaper than the typical Australian diet.\n", "label": 0}, "text-238": {"text": "'Mayhem looms just around the corner': diary from the frontline of the coronavirus health crisis\nI am a doctor in a small, remote hospital with a predominantly Aboriginal patient load. My colleagues and I know we are facing an unprecedented disaster when Covid-19 takes hold in our area, as it seems it must inevitably do.\nOur patients are already among the sickest in the world. They suffer from diabetes, heart disease, obesity and hypertension more severely and at a younger age than any other group anywhere. The rates of kidney and respiratory disease are sky-high. We see sepsis on a daily basis. We see people dying of preventable disease in their 30s, 40s and 50s. I have been a doctor for over 30 years. I have worked all over the world. These patients are the most ill I have ever looked after.\nWhen Covid-19 hits, we are expecting very high death rates among our vulnerable Aboriginal patients, and there are a lot of them. In the 2009 swine flu pandemic, Indigenous Australians made up 11% of all cases and had a six-fold higher death rate than non-Indigenous Australians. We already know that for Covid-19 older age and pre-existing illnesses are strongly associated with an increased death rate, but that is going to be far from the whole story. Widespread house-sharing in overcrowded houses means infection will spread like wildfire, and a significant minority of our patients are already reluctant consumers of healthcare, who only turn up to the hospital when they are very ill. As soon as they start to feel better, they often leave before treatment is completed, only to come back when they get ill again a short time later. Trying to keep some of our Covid-19-infected, ill patients in isolation in hospital or in reliable self-quarantine in the community is simply not going to be possible. And while the judicial power may exist to detain people who pose a risk to public health, neither the resources, nor the political will exist to do so.\nThe lack of staff would eventually mean the hospital would have to close entirely and the population left to fend for itself\nOur hospital is very remote, linked to our referral hospitals only by the lifeline of our aeromedical provider. We will not be able to transport our Covid-19-infected patients to the referral hospital. There will be too many of them. Besides, the logistics of infection control for the aircraft make it almost impossible to transfer on any meaningful scale. That means we will need to ventilate them and then keep them, which we have neither the staff, nor the facilities, to do. Critically ill patients with Covid-19 who require assisted ventilation mostly suffer from a condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), for which the median ventilation period is 9.5 days.\nNo one knows how bad it could really get, but in Northern Italy around 10% of all Covid-19-positives are needing intensive care. If only 20% of our catchment gets infected over a three-month period, and if 10% of those infected need ventilation (an improbably low percentage, given the ill-health of our population), then we would still need to ventilate six new people every day. At best \u2013 which means with a full complement of staff working flat out \u2013 we think we can probably ventilate three or four people at any one time. But it gets much worse. The hospital has just one negative pressure infection control room. Elsewhere in the hospital it will be almost impossible to segregate infected patients. The hospital is going to become a giant petri dish for infection, just as the Diamond Princess did. And then there is the issue of the personal protective equipment (PPE). The PPE we are being asked to use does not cover our necks or hair. Goggles are too small. There are no boots. There are not enough of the higher level N95 face masks. There are not enough theatre scrubs for all staff to wear. There are not enough clean facilities for us to don and doff the PPE and to ensure disinfection. Our PPE stocks for the hospital are currently sufficient for just five weeks of normal use, a fraction of what will be needed. We all know, doctors and nurses, that if we work, we will get infected. We also know that, as for our patients, there will be no ventilators for us if we require them and there will be no evacuation.\nThe medical and nursing pool of staff in this hospital is tiny and our remoteness means that no other help can easily be brought in. And who would want to come anyway? We can just about meet current demand most of the time, though both medical and nursing rosters are always stretched. When the epidemic hits, many staff will be quarantined early, many will get ill, some of whom will die, and many, for very understandable reasons, will simply choose not to come to work at all. \nAt a time of unprecedented demand, therefore, the human resources required to meet it, which would be inadequate at full strength, could be cut to a half, a third or even less. Our emergency department and wards would then be full of people we can\u2019t treat effectively or evacuate and before long we would be turning patients away at the door to go home and die. The apocalyptic, but credible, scenario is that the lack of staff would eventually mean the hospital would have to close entirely and the population left to fend for itself.\nThis is far beyond just a medical problem. This is a full-scale civil defence emergency. Western Australia and the Northern Territory have now released their pandemic plans, and yet we on the frontline are seeing no overall strategic thinking, little understanding of the need to physically segregate Covid-19-positive patients, and little understanding of the implications of our remoteness and the need to isolate vulnerable Aboriginal communities to keep the disease out.\nAfter a late start, the Chinese have got their act together and have done a phenomenal job in all aspects of the epidemic, from contact-tracing and screening, to running huge numbers of patients on assisted ventilation and ECMO. Survival rates in China have been surprisingly good and new cases are now falling rapidly. It\u2019s the ruthless top-down command and control, which unfortunately makes the Chinese regime so unpalatable, combined with the massive resources at its disposal, which allows it to deliver huge infrastructure projects with unbelievable speed and efficiency.\nMeanwhile, here in this remote corner of Australia, we dig trenches and fill sandbags in the \u201cphoney war\u201d, that time of eerie silence when everything looks and feels as it always has, but the prescient know that mayhem looms just around the corner.\n\u2022 The author is a hospital doctor in a remote Australian community", "label": 0}, "text-239": {"text": "european solar & wind countries are 'ostriches in the coal mine'\nThis edited transcript on EIIR of an interview with Professor Larry Bell about Rupert Darwall's book, \"Green Tyranny\" is chock full of facts and figures that rebut alarmist claims about 'climate'change' and \"renewable' energy.", "label": 1}, "text-240": {"text": "UK government lifts block on new onshore windfarm subsidies\nThe UK has abandoned its opposition to subsidising new onshore windfarms, four years after ministers scrapped support for new projects.\nThe government will remove a block against onshore wind projects by allowing schemes to compete for subsidies alongside solar power developments and floating offshore wind projects, in a new auction scheme announced on Monday.\nThe U-turn follows the government\u2019s pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050, a feat that its official climate advisers believe will require the UK\u2019s onshore wind-power capacity to triple in the next 15 years.\nThe auction will take place in 2021, allowing new renewables projects to be up and running from the mid-2020s if they manage to clinch a contract that guarantees a price for the clean electricity they generate.\nAlok Sharma, the secretary of state for business and energy, is said that ending the UK\u2019s contribution to the climate crisis \u201cmeans making the UK a world leader in renewable energy\u201d.\nThe government will do this \u201cin a way that works for everyone, listening to local communities and giving them an effective voice in decisions that affect them\u201d, Sharma said.\nWindfarm developers will need to comply with tough new proposals on community consent to qualify for the auction process.

Both the United Kingdom and the European Union signed the agreement, but now that the United Kingdom will be leaving the European Union, under conditions that have yet to be negotiated, the future of both commitments to the U.N.-sponsored climate agreement are in doubt.\nIn order for the Paris agreement to go into force, it must be ratified by at least 55 parties that together account for at least 55 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions. As a group, the European Union is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, accounting for approximately 10 percent of global emissions.\nConfusion Reigns\nThe uncertainty caused by Brexit was summed up by Andy Jordan, a professor at the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia in England, who reportedly told the Washington Post the day after the Brexit vote U.K. climate policies could shift.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long the exit process will take, and secondly, whether that would end up with the U.K. still in a single market, like Norway, and therefore still within a burden-sharing agreement, or completely outside the EU as a separate state, and therefore, would submit its own [climate pledge],\u201d Jordan said to the Post.\u00a0 \u201cAnd, in fact, it could take years until that\u2019s clear.\u201d\nThe United Kingdom, which has 65 million inhabitants, was the first country in the world to enact a climate change law\u2014the 2008 Climate Change Act, which committed the country to reduce its GHG emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\nAt Paris in 2015, the European Union, with the United Kingdom still a member, pledged to slash its GHG emissions by at least 40 percent by 2040.\u00a0 Under the agreement, the European Union\u2019s commitment is \u201cto be fulfilled jointly.\u201d Now than the United Kingdom, the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy, is set to strike out on its own, it is unclear whether the remaining 27 members will be able to reach the 40-percent-reduction goal.\nAt a June 22 press conference announcing the formation of the Global Covenant of Mayors, \u00a0Christiana Figueres, executive director of the U.N. Commission on Climate Change, raised concerns about what a vote to leave the European Union would mean for the Paris agreement, saying, \u201cFrom the point of view of the Paris agreement, the UK is part of the EU and has put in its effort as part of the EU so anything that would change that would require a recalibration.\u201d\nAdding to the confusion is the political disarray in the United Kingdom. Prime Minister David Cameron resigned and his replacement Theresa May could be less enthusiastic about adopting severe carbon-dioxide restrictions in the midst of the United Kingdom\u2019s divorce from the European Union. Also, because many of the members of the British Parliament who favored the Brexit movement are climate skeptics, they are likely to have greater influence over the exit negotiations, including the United Kingdom\u2019s future climate commitments.\nMore Trouble for E.U.

Poland is doing the same.\n\u201cAt the same time, Britain is looking closely at tapping its vast shale reserves, while it and Denmark are cutting plans for new wind farms,\u201d Driessen said.\n\u201cThe United Kingdom has experienced a great deal of buyer\u2019s remorse since making its carbon-dioxide-reduction pledge in 2008,\u201d said James Taylor, president of the Spark of Freedom Foundation.\n\u201cA substantial increase in wind turbines since 2008 pushed electricity prices higher than promised, while reliability declined,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThis has led U.K. government officials to rethink their commitment to wind power.\u201d\nBonner R.

With Bob\u2019s permission I provide the text and graphics from this complaint\u2026\nComplaint summary:  The programme presented various anecdotal claims associated with recent severe weather events that prima facie seemed to be far-fetched.  When those claims were subjected to the simplest of validity checks they were found to be false and very misleading.  Also, important information that is available from various authoritative sources but that was opposite to the dramatically orchestrated programme agenda was excluded.\nExample 1)\n1.1) From the transcript:\n\u201cMARTIN ROYDS, Jillamatong Beef, Braidwood NSW: The temperatures are more erratic, we seem to get frosts in the middle of summer, we\u2019ve had frosts nearly on Christmas day. We\u2019re getting hot, dry weather in the middle of winter. so the climates got a lot more erratic.\u201d\nA simple Google search for \u2018Summer frost NSW Australia\u2019 yielded 428,000 hits, but nothing of relevance was found.   A similar search for \u2018hot winter day NSW Australia\u2019 yielded only a report of a single warm day of 26 0C in Sydney in July 2017.  However, Sydney is incomparable climatically because Braidwood is located at an altitude of about 690m (2,250 feet), in The Tablelands east of Canberra.\nSo, what does the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) have to say?  Quite a lot actually.  They opened a weather station at Braidwood Racecourse in 1985, and:\nThere was a solitary rather cold overnight Summer minimum of 2.3 0C on the 17/Feb/2017, but it was consistently colder in past decades (figure 1).\nThere was a solitary warm winter day maximum of 20.9 0C on 22/August/2015, but again, it was consistently warmer in the past, with a notable cluster of up to 22.3 0C in 1995 (figure 2).\n1.2) From the Transcript:\nMARTIN ROYDS: Yes we have 130 years of rainfall and temperature graphs.  Since 1985 to now, the temperatures have been increasing .8 of a degree per decade.  So, in that thirty year period, it\u2019s gone up 2.4 degrees, maximum temperature.\nHowever, that would be an eight-degree rise per century, or implausibly about eight times greater than the Australian average as stated by the BoM\u2019s Dr Braganza at 5 video-minutes.  Also, the BoM data show no discernible warming trend in the summertime maxima at the racecourse (figure 2).\n1.3) From the Transcript (summarising Mr Royds\u2019 views):\n\u201cMICHAEL BRISSENDEN: All around the district the dams have been drying up\u2026 Braidwood slipped into drought once again and it\u2019s taking a heavy toll on the local farmers.\u201d\nHowever, the available BoM rainfall data for the Racecourse reveals no discernible rainfall reduction trend since 1985 and nothing unusual in annual variability apart from a drier period in the 1990\u2019s (figure 3).\n1.4) From Mr Royds\u2019 website:\nHe runs a business which provides accommodation for up to 52 people to \u201cLive, Learn, Relax at Tombarra\u201d to engage in conferences and workshops etcetera focussing on land and environmental matters.  The possibility that he might gain financial benefits from the claims made above should have caught the notice of any nonaligned investigative reporter.\nExample 2)\nThe opening narrative sets-up the programme agenda with several sensational TV news grabs:\n2.1) Sydney newsreader:\n\u201cTonight fires break out across the state as Sydney sizzles and the mercury soars, with Penrith recording its hottest day ever at 47.3 degrees.\nThis claim became rapidly obsolete in the media with widespread correction of a mistaken early tweet from the BoM.   Again, your investigative reporter apparently failed to do a quick online search for \u2018Penrith 47.3\u2019 or the like.   Maurice Newman, a former Chairman of the ABC put it rather succinctly in The Australian:\n\u201c\u2026according to Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology, little old Penrith in Sydney, Australia, was the warmest spot on the planet, recording its highest temperature ever, having \u201cbroken the all-time maximum temperature record for \u2026 the Sydney metropolitan area\u201d.  Well, perhaps in all that excitement the bureau can be forgiven for overlooking the fact Penrith Lakes started recording temperatures only in 1995 and for missing a much higher temperature recorded in nearby Richmond in 1939. But they were right. It was hot.\u201d\n2.2) Brisbane newsreader:\n\u201cQueenslanders have suffered through temperatures at least 10 degrees above average as the heatwave sets in for the weekend.\nThe claim of \u201cat least 10 degrees above average\u201d is again severally misleading including that sparsely populated areas in the hot centre have a long history of very high fluctuations in temperature that were more severe than those of late.   Your programme failed to reveal the proper perspective of various less alarming reports such as in the Brisbane Times on 15/Feb/2018 (even though it too is partly exaggerative or mistaken when compared with the relevant BoM databases):\n\u201c[BoM] forecaster Sean Fitzgerald said much of Queensland recorded temperatures above 35 degrees during the week.\nIn particular, out west is where it is very very hot \u2013 temperatures out there are at or exceeding 40 in some places, so quite a bit above average,\u201d Mr Fitzgerald said.\n\u201cLots of places are five degrees above average and some places are even 10 degrees above average, so plenty of warm temperatures about the state.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about places like Charleville, Longreach, Roma even Toowoomba.\u201d\nRecords were also broken in Winton in central-west Queensland which recorded 46.5 degrees on Wednesday, breaking a February 28, 2016, record of 45.5* degrees, while a couple of hundred kilometres south, in Richmond, a 1983 record of 44 degrees was broken when the town hit 44.5 degrees.\u201d\nHowever, when the BoM databases are examined, all six stations cited were relatively cool in recent times.  (e.g. figures 4, 5, 6)\nMistakenly, the forecaster\u2019s statement about Richmond is strongly contradicted in figure 3, and, although the stated 45.5 in 2018 is apparently OK, one of the corrective BoM tweets on the saga in 2.1 above admitted that it was 2.3 degrees hotter in 1939.   Also, the Winton, Roma and Toowoomba examples only have short records that are incapable of providing long-term trend determinations.  Moreover, Winton\u2019s 45.5 in 2018 did not break the record high of 46.9 on 1/Dec/2006 anyway!\n2.3) Melbourne newsreader:\n\u201cThe state\u2019s public transport system and power supply have come under pressure as Melbourne baked through its hottest day in two years.\nThere were 193 days hotter than 40 degrees recorded at the Melbourne Regional Office before its closure in 2015.  At Olympic Park, the replacing station, it spiked at 41.7 0C on 6/Jan/2018 atop a modest month average of only 27.2 0C.  Some more notable past highs were; 2009* = 46.4, 1939* = 45.6, 1908 = 44.2, 2003 = 44.1, 1862 = 44.0.\nSo, a single 41.7 0C day in Melbourne is hardly a big deal but it is dressed-up to be a sign of pending doom.   * Catastrophic bushfires driven by extreme winds from the hot interior.\nPlease advise what corrective action will be taken over the seriously misleading statements in all of these seven points, and over failure to check their validity or provide balance.\nEnds. [This is the extent of the text and charts as provided by Bob, and I thank him for letting me putting them on the public record here.]\nI would encourage others with a strong empirical background to also lodge formal complaints.\nAn underlying theme of the Four Corners program is that the general situation across Australia is one of declining rainfall.  In fact, while the overall trend for south western Australia, the example provided in the program, may be one of decline, in many other areas there has been record high rainfall over the last decade.  For example, the highest recorded annual rainfall total since 1900, for the Murray Darling Basin, was in 2010.", "label": 1}, "text-244": {"text": "Sports quiz of the week: laughter, LeBron, L'Equipe and F1 fastest laps", "label": 0}, "text-245": {"text": "Weatherwatch: how Europe is aiming to read climate change\nLooking at weather maps showing the changes in temperature already occurring in Europe it is clear how lucky those are who live next to the cooling Atlantic Ocean.

And, of course, he\u2019s not alone in this \u2013 true, comedy was only a sideline for Johnson, but for Italy\u2019s Beppe Grillo, and now Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskiy, one-liners have become party ones. Then there\u2019s Marjan \u0160arec, in Slovenia, and Jimmy Morales, in Guatemala, both former comedians who abandoned their shtick in favour of the slapstick of governance. Just how good any of these characters were as comics is debatable \u2013 I suppose you had to be there and then, rather than here and now, since none of them has been doing terribly well at the notoriously unfunny business of making life-and-death decisions concerning your fellow human beings.\nWhat might life be like in a country helmed by a genuinely funny comedian, rather than a farceur?\nIn the long dark night of my soul, when I\u2019ve failed to surf that wave of illegal melatonin into even the lightest of slumbers, disturbing visions throng my mind: I imagine a summit convened by that prime-time joker-in-chief Donald \u201cthe Donald\u201d Trump. Around the polished oval stage in the Oval Office, sit Messrs Johnson, Zelenskiy et al, all rocking and rolling with laughter as they carve the world\u2019s audience up between them. But if superannuated comedians are our new rulers, perhaps we\u2019ve only ourselves to blame? Did we not laugh too readily at their feeble quips, thereby propelling them into office? At this year\u2019s Edinburgh fringe, the funniest joke award went to this one, by the hilariously named comedian Olaf Falafel: \u201cI keep randomly shouting out \u2018broccoli\u2019 and \u2018cauliflower\u2019 \u2013 I think I may have florets.\u201d\nFrankly, if I\u2019d been on hand to heckle when Falafel threw up this little ball of wit, I\u2019d have shouted \u201cFuck you, you fucking shitting wanking fuck, you\u2019re about as funny as fucking fuck-all \u2013 what makes people with Tourette\u2019s ripe for your alleged \u2018humour\u2019? Are there other disabled folk you\u2019d like to have a go at while you\u2019re up there?\u201d Thereby exhibiting the rank hypocrisy of those of us who aren\u2019t so much woke as utterly insomniac. But even setting the prejudice to one side, Falafel\u2019s joke is a pretty tired bit of punning. Nietzsche quipped that \u201cWit is the epitaph of an emotion\u201d but, even as epitaphs go, puns are a grave old business.\nI do hope Messrs Mitchell and Lee will be using their downtime to re-up on their material \u2013 so you can look forward to plenty of hearty chuckles in the autumn, when broccoli and cauliflower become too expensive even for Observer readers. But my suspicion is that they may, in fact, be moonlighting as premiers themselves, while you have to put up with my second-division repartee.\nThis rather raises the question: what might life be like in a country helmed by a genuinely funny comedian, rather than a farceur who dreams of being taken seriously? In \u201cLeedonia\u201d, I imagine our F\u00fchrer arriving in his trademark circus car, accompanied by a posse of heavily armed clowns. Speeches would take the form of tightly scripted hour-long rants fusing the surreal, the paranoid and the scatological with such elan (and dog-whistle virtue-signalling) that the poor citizenry would be left undone, having been chafed unmercifully by the rubbing of their urine-soaked clothing against their heaving bellies. What matter that they be empty of food, if they\u2019re filled with guffaws?\nAs for David Mitchell, with his bearded and bookish mien, it\u2019s not hard to picture him as some sort of nerd-in-chief, earnestly urging his encyclopaedic knowledge on his people. Perhaps, like the one-time dictator of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov, Mitchell will write an interminably long book aimed at the spiritual guidance of the people. There\u2019s a huge mechanical statue of the Ruhnama \u2013 as it\u2019s called \u2013 in Ashgabat, the capital, and, at 8pm every day, this opens mechanically and a passage is read through loudspeakers. But whereas Niyazov mixed together the Qur\u2019an, Sufi poetry and his own wild cosmic speculations, Mitchell\u2019s tome will consist of page after page of unbelievable truths, and the mechanical voice reading them out will be nasal and laconic.\nI do hope something like this is actually going on right now \u2013 and that, in a fortnight\u2019s time, revitalised, Mitchell\u2019s and Lee\u2019s satiric armies will invade Britain and put paid to its new farceur-among-equals with volleys of perfectly aimed pasquinades. Because, let\u2019s face it, the alternative isn\u2019t funny at all.", "label": 0}, "text-248": {"text": "Don't dread the European elections \u2013 they could fix our broken politics\nAfter months and months of picking over the minutiae of negotiations in parliament and beyond, the UK is tired of Brexit. I know I am; you take one day off from following the ins and outs and even though \u201cnothing has changed\u201d for weeks, you\u2019re somehow behind. You know it\u2019s important, but watching politicians and commentators trade macho insults is incredibly tedious. And now there could be European elections on the cards.\nA European election might seem like a distraction when it can\u2019t deliver what the country desperately needs: a general election and with it a new government that will fund our schools so they aren\u2019t at the point of collapse and design an economy where the norm is not plummeting living standards and rising homelessness. \nEuropean elections are a hard sell. We were told we\u2019d have left the EU by now. A swift, successful departure is what leave MPs kept saying was possible \u2013 and it\u2019s what Theresa May said she would deliver. For people who want Brexit over, the last thing they\u2019re interested in is voting for more politicians they don\u2019t even think should exist. But with the Commons in deadlock, elections on the 23 May is where we might be headed.\nSo it seems to me there\u2019s a choice: either the elections end up as a rerun of the referendum campaign \u2013 with one side demanding Brexit and crying betrayal and the other rehashing the same uncritical pro-EU messages from three years ago \u2013 or we step away from these torturous, well-rehearsed arguments and try something different. Rather than resent the elections, perhaps they could be an opportunity to talk about all the things we haven\u2019t been focusing on because of Brexit.\nThe British left has to engage. We have a pretty good idea what the right will say, focused as they are on ramping up anti-immigrant rhetoric, imperial nostalgia and mythical sovereignty. Their rhetoric poses a very real, violent threat that must be countered.\nWhether, in the end, we remain just inside the EU, just outside of it or somewhere else altogether, there are issues the left has to consider and bring to the mainstream. It must tap into progressive internationalist movements \u2013 including explaining the importance of cooperation with the rest of Europe \u2013 and advocate for tackling tax avoidance, climate change, the rise of the far right and the mistreatment of migrants.\nLast month, right in front of the building where MPs have been plotting their next moves and TV stations have almost permanently set up camp, thousands of schoolchildren gathered in Parliament Square as part of a global movement demanding action on climate breakdown. A few days of news coverage, some tone-deaf comments from Theresa May and the news cycle moved on, but the climate is still breaking down. We need to hear nonstop about Labour\u2019s green new deal and how they are working with people around the world on climate change; about how MEPs might team up with their leftwing allies to develop this \u2013 and what this future cooperation might look like.\nThe far right is on the rise and already attempting to commandeer the levers of the EU. Matteo Salvini \u2013 the Italian deputy prime minister, who last year said he would expel Roma from his country, where there has since been an intensification of violent anti-Roma racism \u2013 is trying to build an alliance of far right parties for the elections. And though far from a unified force, the far-right already has a foothold in Poland, Hungary and Austria and is doing well in other parts of the continent. If it gains more power and is able to wield anti-immigrant politics to promote a racially homogenous Europe, the continent\u2019s borders will become firmer \u2013 and member states\u2019 policies will become ever more violent, exclusionary and racist. We need a united, anti-racist, pro-migrant left fighting across and against borders worldwide.\nBut of all the problems at the heart of Brexit, the one that has been most neglected is Britain\u2019s deep and damaging anti-migrant politics. The left needs to take on anti-migrant narratives unashamedly and directly, including during the European elections. Arguing for free movement is one of many starting points. The failure of the Labour party to make the case for this, loud and proud, is hugely disappointing. But if the broader left can keep up the pressure, the leadership has shown it is not above changing course.\nThe Conservative party has been tearing chunks out of itself over Europe for decades and it\u2019s conducting the final stage of that battle while in government, to the detriment of us all. All the while, our slow destruction of the planet accelerates, and inequality and anti-migrant politics grow. There is no quick fix but the left should use everything they can to change the debate for the better. The European elections should be seen not as an irrelevant distraction, but as an opportunity to campaign for a better future.\n\u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and researcher.

As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable.\nIn his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nMH: Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 in those clinical trials, terminally ill patients took psychedelic drugs under close medical supervision, right? But the results sound remarkable\nMP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted.\nMH: Do those experiences and your other research suggest that psychedelic drugs can be an antidote to climate grief?\nMP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work.\nMH: How did that reset happen?\nMP: I can\u2019t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is [help] people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected \u2013 more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who\u2019d been working on this issue a long time. They\u2019ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they\u2019re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression.\nMH: If \u2018antidote\u2019 is too strong, would \u2018treatment\u2019 be a better word?\nMP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment.\nMH: But climate grief is different in important ways from an individual facing a terminal diagnosis. Climate grief is not necessarily about your own death but more about the death of the world around you \u2013 a kind of collective, civilizational death\nMP: Yeah, and here\u2019s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist!\nMH: Are psychedelics relevant to climate grief in any other ways?\nMP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called \u201cnature connectedness\u201d \u2013 the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of \u201cnature connectedness\u201d went up consistently and fairly dramatically.\nThis rings true to me and to many of the people I\u2019ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there\u2019s a single subject \u2013 you \u2013 while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis \u2013 our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has \u2013 at least theoretically \u2013 the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that.\nMH: You\u2019re a parent. I\u2019m a parent; my daughter just turned 15. A big part of my climate grief relates to the future she\u2019s going to inherit. And not just her but the countless other kids around the world in her generation. Can psychedelics be helpful to parents dealing with climate grief?\nMP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There\u2019s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there\u2019s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill.\nMH: I\u2019ve covered climate change as a journalist for 30 years, and when people ask, I always say that the only solution to climate grief for me is taking action \u2013 doing something to make me feel I\u2019m having an effect on this. Taking action is clearly a climate solution. Are psychedelic drugs, in a different way, also a climate solution?\nMP: No, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices \u2013 giving up meat, for example \u2013 is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics \u2026 But what\u2019s exciting and new is that we\u2019re coming to recognize psychedelics\u2019 therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.\nThis story originally appeared in the Nation and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate story", "label": 0}, "text-250": {"text": "Softly-softly won\u2019t save the planet\nEveryone making minor lifestyle changes over the last 30-40 years might have helped but I suspect matters are now rather late (\u201cTiny changes in our lives might seem trivial.

Even if human activities became greenhouse-gas neutral overnight, gas escapes from once-frozen deposits would continue to boost levels, while fires and dying vegetation worsen matters further. Geo-engineering is risky but may soon become necessary.\nSome years ago, environmentalists reckoned three to four fully utilised planets would be needed for everyone to have western lifestyles and the jobs to afford them. Add in rising human numbers plus the potential need to rehome climate refugees and this could increase significantly. Yet how are politicians reacting? There have been no signs of petrol rationing, population policies, cutting cash-crop production, grounding flights, curbing consumerism or even a cattle cull. Such changes would need tax hikes and would trigger howls of outrage that governments have no business behaving like that in liberal democracies. Yet liberal democracies may not last long if action isn\u2019t taken.

There are many different ways to be \u201cgenuinely Welsh\u201d and speaking yr iaith (the language) is one but, having lived in Wrexham for nearly 20 years, I can say that the county borough of Wrexham is as Welsh as Gwynedd or Ceredigion, it just has a different version of Welshness; much as being English in Essex, Devon and Lancashire varies.\nMeanwhile, I would like Dorling to point to an \u201cEnglish community\u201d in Wrexham county borough. There is no such thing!

I was dismayed to read this characterisation of our peaceful act of musical resistance that I initiated a few weeks ago. I asked some friends if they\u2019d join me in singing songs about love and hope at the same time as Shakeel Afsar staged his protest [against the school\u2019s LGBTQ-inclusive teaching].

My eating disorders were a means of taking back control when faced with the challenges of university finals, my parents\u2019 divorce and my own divorce. I did not seek help for my bulimia, primarily out of shame. It was only when I realised that my anorexia was becoming life-threatening that I sought help.\nI am certain that the official NHS statistics for hospital admissions cited in the article mask the scale of the problem. Eating disorders are mental illnesses and I hope that we will see the same acceptance and acknowledgment of their prevalence among men as we are seeing with anxiety, depression and the like.

She also recently started work as a student funding officer at a London university.\nInstrumental in this transformation has been the support she has received from a pioneering programme, launched in spring 2018, that helps people with mental health issues to find, and stay in, work.\nRun by charity Hillside Clubhouse in partnership with Camden and Islington NHS trust with funding from Camden council and the Cabinet Office, Camden Work and Wellbeing (CWAW) uses a scheme called individual placement and support (IPS). This involves employment specialists working alongside clinical teams, providing one-to-one support, including helping with writing CVs and applications, and liaising with employers.\nIPS has changed the way health professionals in the area work with clients, says Louise Cantrell, service manager for the NHS\u2019s south Camden rehabilitation and recovery team.\n\u201cWe often talk about people\u2019s problems. We might focus on their diagnosis, medication or symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cBut thinking about employment has had a beneficial influence on the team and the kind of conversations we are having with people. We are not just focusing on negative, problematic things.\n\u201cWe can also focus on the future and hopefully have a role in helping people achieve what they want to in life.\u201d\nGraeme Jones, director of Hillside Clubhouse, says the programme involves asking clients about the type of job they want, the environment they want to work in and the support they need to maintain employment. \u201cOnce people start in work,\u201d he says, \u201cthe employment specialist will provide that support to make sure they continue and sustain in that job.\u201d\n Since its launch in spring 2018, CWAW has helped 228 mental health service users into employment. It has also supported 162 other people to return to or retain their jobs. It is recognised as a centre of excellence for IPS, which being rolled out across England.\nThree-quarters of the people supported by CWAW, some of whom had not worked for decades, were still in their jobs after six weeks. IPS has a higher success rate than other models and the NHS is putting in extra funding to increase access to the programme, with the aim of helping 55,000 people each year to find and retain employment by 2023-24. A pilot study is also looking at whether the scheme can be used to support people with physical ill health.\n\u201cPeople are going into real, mainstream jobs,\u201d adds Jones. One CWAW client has taken a role as a government communications assistant, while others are working as administrators, care assistants, waiters and teachers. Some have gone on to work for the local NHS trust.\nAsiimwe, a hospitality and tourism management graduate, first received support from the CWAW pilot in 2017. Employment specialist Leah Kraithman helped her look for and apply for jobs, and she secured a nine-month contract with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts as a registry officer. Her health then deteriorated again and in the summer of 2018, she had a liver transplant.\nAfter a year recovering, Asiimwe again worked with Kraithman and, after two short-term contracts with different employers, found her present position. \u201cThe support I\u2019ve had from Leah has been so helpful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t there, I don\u2019t know how I would have coped with finding work. When you\u2019re not at work it can be so depressing and demoralising and you feel like you are worthless, not contributing to society.\n\u201cWorking has really boosted my confidence and self-esteem. It has really helped me get into a routine. I feel like I am doing something good; I have achieved a lot, considering what I have been through over the past couple of years.\u201d\nKraithman, who is now IPS operations manager with CWAW, says clients receive \u201ctime unlimited support\u201d.\nShe adds: \u201cIt is not about getting them into a job, ticking a box, and leaving them. It is about working with them as long as they need us, but the aim is to increase their independence and their confidence and we slowly back away.\u201d\nAsiimwe says the support she has received has also helped her to focus on her priorities beyond work. \u201cNow my health is so important to me and I take time out just for me; to chill, to relax,\u201d she says. \n\u201cI think back to 2015, 2016, when I was in such a bad place and when my health deteriorated, I couldn\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel.

It said shoppers could get fewer discounts, receive a lower quality of customer service and enjoy less choice in stores and online.\nJD Sports, Britain\u2019s biggest sports retailer, hit back at the competition watchdog in a strongly worded statement, claiming the CMA\u2019s findings were \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. It vowed to fight them.\nIt said the competition regulator failed to recognise the rapidly changing nature of the UK sports retail market, where a large number of retailers selling third-party brands compete, as well as other online players and the international brands selling directly to customers.\nThe JD Sports executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s provisional decision is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of our market to an alarming extent, given its six-month review.\n\u201cThe competitive landscape described by the CMA is one which neither I, nor any experienced sector analyst, would recognise. Just take a walk down any major UK high street or search for Nike or Adidas trainers on Google and you can see for yourself how competitive this marketplace really is.\u201d\nIt added: \u201cWe cannot comprehend how the CMA concludes that Nike and Adidas will not be significantly stronger competitors in the marketplace over the next few years. Experienced analysts in this sector simply would not recognise this conclusion.\n\u201cWe feel that, in its findings, the CMA has lost sight of its objective to protect consumer interests.\u201d\nJD Sports has 394 JD-branded stores in the UK and Ireland as well as 120 shops under other brands such as Size? and Footpatrol, while Footasylum has 70 stores. Sports clothing and footwear is a growing market in the UK, worth more than \u00a35bn in 2018.\nKip Meek, the chair of the independent group leading the CMA inquiry, said: \u201cWe\u2019re currently concerned that shoppers could lose out after the merger, for example through fewer discounts and less choice in stores and online. This could particularly affect younger customers and students, who shop in JD Sports and Footasylum.\u201d\nThe CMA is asking for views on its provisional findings by 3 March and possible remedies by 25 February and will assess all evidence provided before making a final decision. It said: \u201cIts current view is that blocking the deal by requiring JD Sports to sell the Footasylum business may be the only way of addressing these competition concerns.\u201d\nJD Sports noted that the CMA itself recognised that Footasylum had a market share below 5%, and said this showed the takeover was small in relation to the overall market. It estimates that Footasylum would contribute less than 2% of group profits in the year to January 2020. After enjoying a good Christmas, JD Sports said it expected profits to hit at least the top end of analysts\u2019 forecasts, which range from \u00a3403m to \u00a3434m.

Australia\u2019s annual emissions hit a record high in 2018 of 558.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.\nSerrano said: \u201cWhen these ecosystems are damaged by storms, heatwaves, dredging or other human development, the carbon dioxide stored in their biomass and soils beneath them can make its way back into the environment, contributing to climate change.\n\u201cGlobally, vegetated coastal ecosystems are being lost twice as fast as tropical rainforests despite covering a fraction of the area.\u201d\nCoastal ecosystems store carbon in their soils as well as in the plants themselves and, once absorbed, the carbon can be locked away for thousands of years if undisturbed. They are able to absorb at up to 40 times faster than forests.\n\u201cThey also protect the coasts from erosion, are important nurseries for fisheries and they clear up the water so it\u2019s very important for several reasons that we preserve these ecosystems,\u201d Serrano said.\nHe said the ecosystems were being impacted by coastal developments, dredging and by climate change.\nThe annual losses of carbon from the coastal ecosystems was the equivalent of a 12% to 21% increase in Australia\u2019s land-use emissions from activities such as land-clearing.\nIn 2015, mangroves on the Gulf of Carpentaria suffered an unprecedented mass dieback along a 1,000-kilometre stretch of coastline that coincided with a major heatwave.\nProf Norman Duke, of James Cook University, who was not part of the study, said the advantage of quantifying the carbon stored in mangroves was that it created a \u201cmarketable commodity\u201d that could be used as part of carbon trading schemes.\nDuke, who is leading a project to assess the mass dieback event, said mangroves were a particularly powerful tool to cut emissions because they had about five times more capacity to store carbon than trees on the land.\nHe said: \u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere, this gives us a very strong incentive [to protect them]. But that\u2019s not the only benefits that mangroves deliver \u2013 they give habitats to fisheries and protect our coastlines.\u201d\nRecovery of mangroves in the gulf has been hampered by dead mangroves, broken up by subsequent storms, piling up on areas of new growth. A seperate study has found the Gulf of Carpentaria\u2019s dead mangroves emit eight times the amount of powerful greenhouse gas methane than live mangroves.\nDr Andy Steven, coasts research director at CSIRO and a co-author of the research, said: \u201cWhen we started this work in 2014, we had no real numbers. We didn\u2019t know how significant it was, or even if they were worth thinking about. But we\u2019ve shown demonstrably that these ecosystems are very significant.\u201d\nTo calculate the carbon content of the ecosystems, the researchers combined satellite data on the extent of mangroves and tidal marshes with direct measurements of the carbon stored in soils and plants.\nSerrano and Stevens said there was hope the methodology used to calculate the climate benefits of vegetated coastal ecosystems would be used as part of Australia\u2019s official national greenhouse accounts in the future.\nSerrano said the research could position Australia as a \u201cworld leader\u201d in protecting blue carbon ecosystems, adding other countries could use their work to make their own national measurements.", "label": 0}, "text-254": {"text": "a knife through the heart of man-made global warming\n\"If substantiated, this research blows the man-made global warming theory (anthropogenic forcing) right out of the water.

An investigation is being held to understand the circumstances around the case.\nTen cases were notified on Wednesday in Mabalako, North Kivu province, where the individual is believed to be from, after another six on Tuesday, according to officials who noted that three out of the six were practitioners of traditional medicine.\nThe spike \u2013 and the worrying circumstances behind it \u2013 appears to buck a trend towards a declining number of cases, although security issues in the key zones of Beni, Biakato and Mangina had recently paralysed the response after violent attacks on health workers.\nAmong the possibilities being examined are reinfection with the disease \u2013 which would ring the most serious alarm bells as no case of reinfection has ever been recorded before \u2013 or a relapse.\nEbola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976 in two outbreaks, located in what is now known as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter outbreak was in a village near the Ebola River, giving the disease its name.\nEbola causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection. It is spread from person to person through body fluids.\nInfected patients are isolated and treated by medical teams wearing full protective body suits who try to boost their immune response. The average case fatality rate is around 50% - and health-care workers have frequently been infected. Burial ceremonies involving direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to transmission.\nA vaccine, still experimental, has proven to be highly effective in preventing the disease, according to the World Health Organization.\u00a0\nWhile rare cases of relapse have been documented, in which a person who has recovered from Ebola gets its symptoms again, reinfection would mean a person who has recovered has been infected anew with the virus by another person, a circumstance so far undocumented.\nExperts have long been anxious about the risk of recurrence because the virus can persist for months in areas of the body that are immunologically protected, including semen, vaginal fluids, sweat, aqueous humour, urine, breast milk and even spinal fluid after initial onset and recovery.\nThat has led researchers to speculate about the continued risk of transmission in individuals not showing any symptoms, including through sexual activity, leading to reactivation of the illness.\nReinfection, relapse and recurrence are all sources of acute concern in controlling the outbreak, as Ebola survivors are employed widely in treatment centres in DRC on the assumption they cannot usually recontract or transmit the disease.\nIn July another patient died from what was also presumed to be a relapse or reinfection, calling into question the assumption that Ebola survivors have lifelong immunity from the virus.\nAccording to figures from the African Union as of 8 December, the Ebola outbreak in DRC has claimed 2,209 lives since it broke out, with 3,327 recorded cases.", "label": 0}, "text-256": {"text": "Africa's fragile health systems rush to contain coronavirus\nGovernments across Africa are rushing to reinforce measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, fearing that fragile health systems will be swiftly overwhelmed if the disease spreads beyond a small number of cases on the continent.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) officials have called for a strong response to a \u201ctremendously fast rise in the number of countries with cases being confirmed\u201d.\n\u201cWe have to ratchet up what is being done,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa.\n\u201cIt is what is done at this point that will determine the numbers who will become very ill \u2026 I still think it is possible that we will prevent large numbers of people dying but it needs coordination, a huge effort and huge resources.\u201d\nMost infections involve people who have recently been in Europe or other disease hot spots, but the number of cases of internal transmission are rising every day.\nTedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has warned that official numbers may underestimate the extent of the spread of the disease.\n\u201cProbably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.\u201d\nHealth officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through overcrowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, the malnourished or those suffering from HIV and other chronic conditions.\nThe WHO is working to establish the exact numbers of ICU beds available across the continent. \u201cWe know [the number] is extremely limited \u2026 It is a huge challenge,\u201d said Moetse. \u201cIt is necessary not to give up on containment .\u201d\nSouth Africa, which has one of Africa\u2019s best public health systems, has fewer than 1,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 160 are in the private sector, for a population of 56m. In Malawi, there are about 25 ICU beds in public hospitals, serving 17 million people. The main infectious diseases hospital in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare, has none, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said.\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous state, is scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals.\n\u201cOur health system is not as strong as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control. \u201cIt is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak that we are focused so intensively on prevention and early detection.\u201d\nMany states have suspended flights and other transport links with badly hit zones in Europe and Asia, or are strictly controlling entry. Restrictions have also been placed on public gatherings, schools and religious services, and mass events have been cancelled across the continent.\nJane Ruth Aceng, Uganda\u2019s minister of health, said the country was on \u201chigh alert\u201d as almost all its neighbours have registered cases of Covid-19. \u201cNo country can say they are 100% prepared,\u201d Aceng told the Guardian.\nUganda\u2019s new coronavirus tsar, Atel Kagirita, said the virus \u201cwill not be a big problem ... if we can effectively stop local transmission.\u201d\n\u201cWe \u2026 don\u2019t envisage having many cases [needing critical care] because we are putting all our efforts on prevention. We are doing a lot of community awareness campaigns and public education,\u201d Kagirita said.\nThough Aceng said she was confident Uganda has \u201cenough capacity beds, some ICU units and ventilation to handle a possible outbreak\u201d, some fear this is too optimistic. Uganda \u2013 population 44m \u2013 is relying primarily on the 1,500-bed Mulago National Referral Hospital. Its ICU can currently accommodate 60 patients.\nThere are also limited facilities for isolation. In South Sudan, devastated by a five-year civil war, the government has just 24 isolation beds, said Dr. Angok Gordon Kuol, incident manager for the outbreak at the ministry of health.\nIn Somalia, health minister Dr Fawziya Abikar said the government has established a quarantine facility at Mogadishu airport and was equipping a hospital to deal with Covid-19 cases. \u201cWe are still waiting for more equipment for the hospital to arrive,\u201d he said.\nDr Ali Yusuf, one of a team of health officials preventing and controlling the Coronavirus, told the Guardian that facilities were extremely limited. \u201cWe only have 15 tents, with one bed each for quarantine and isolation of suspected cases. Our hospital can accommodate only 100 beds,\u201d Dr Yusuf said.\nMany African countries have extensive experience in controlling highly infectious and potentially lethal diseases. Preparations for an outbreak of Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, mean that Uganda has already stockpiled protective equipment, drugs and tents, as well as developing a capacity of moving samples around the country to a central laboratory or using mobile testing laboratories.\nAlso, the delayed arrival of the virus has allowed governments to work with the WHO to strengthen emergency coordination, improve surveillance, and begin equipping treatment centres.\nBut few doubt that if the virus starts to take hold the consequences could be very serious, with health systems rapidly overwhelmed.\nProf Pauline Byakika, a specialist in infectious diseases at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University College of Health Sciences, said she was worried that \u201conce its gets here, [coronavirus] was going to spread very fast\u201d. She said the \u201csocial environment\u201d of many homes, with poor hygiene and ventilation, posed a very high risk.\n\u201cThey are about five or six people in a house with one or two windows. Before you know it the whole household is going to be sick,\u201d she said.\nThere are similar fears in South Africa, where president Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a state of national disaster and imposed stringent restrictions. As elsewhere in the continent, the youthfulness of South Africa\u2019s population may help \u2013 only 6% of South Africans are older than 65, which is the higher-risk age group for coronavirus. However, tens of millions live in vast townships and share crowded public transport. Of the 7.7 million South Africans living with HIV, about half are not taking medication that would restore their compromised immune systems.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\n\u201cWe are at this very early phase where it is critically important that we contain the virus,\u201d said Richard Friedland, the head of South Africa\u2019s largest private healthcare provider Netcare. \u201cThe key issue is with people living in informal settlements, in shacks \u2026 that (are) very difficult to self isolate.\u201d \nMany countries in Africa already face huge challenges from war or natural disasters or both. \u201cThe worst is yet to come on the continent \u2026 I fear it will be impossible to stop the spread of the virus in a refugee camp,\u201d said Patrick Youssef, the deputy director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nA 2016 analysis by the Rand Corporation, the US think-tank, found that of the 25 countries in the world that were most vulnerable to infectious outbreaks, 22 were in Africa. The others were Afghanistan, Yemen and Haiti.\n\u201cWere a communicable disease to emerge within this chain of countries, it could easily spread across borders in all directions, abetted by high overall vulnerability and a string of weak national health systems along the way,\u201d the report warned.\nAdditional reporting by Abdalle Ahmed Mumin in Mogadishu and Charles Pensulo, Lilongwe", "label": 0}, "text-257": {"text": "This was supposed to be Ireland's climate election \u2013 what happened?\nIreland had seemed poised for its first climate-centric general election, with concern about carbon emissions and species extinction expected to shape the battle for votes on 8 February.\nLast year, after all, Ireland became only the second country in the world to declare a climate and biodiversity emergency. \u201cGreat news from Ireland!!

In an opinion poll, 55% of Irish voters named climate change as the most serious issue facing the planet and 54% said they were prepared to curb their living standards to combat the threat.\nBut now, with two weeks to go, most voters are tuning out on the environment. In an Irish Times opinion poll last week, just 7% of participants said climate change would have the most influence on their vote.\nInstead of global, voters are thinking local. Forty per cent said healthcare was the most important issue and 32% said housing, reflecting widespread anger over hospital bed shortages, waiting lists, soaring rents and homelessness.\nFine Gael\nIts name can be translated as family or tribe of the Irish.

Appeals to the urban middle class and well-off farmers.\nFianna F\u00e1il\nIts name means Soldiers of Destiny. A centrist, ideologically malleable party that dominated Irish politics until it steered the Celtic Tiger economy over a cliff, prompting decade-long banishment to opposition benches. Under Miche\u00e1l Martin, a nimble political veteran, it has clawed back support and may overtake Fine Gael as the biggest party and lead the next coalition government. Founded by \u00c9amon de Valera, who backed the civil war\u2019s losing side but turned Fianna F\u00e1il into an election-winning machine.\nSinn F\u00e9in\nIts name means We Ourselves, signifying Irish sovereignty. A leftwing republican party that competes in Northern Ireland as well as the Republic. Traces roots to 1905. Emerged in current form during the Troubles, when it was linked to the IRA. Peace in Northern Ireland helped Sinn F\u00e9in rebrand as a working-class advocate opposed to austerity.

A politician who lingers on national let alone international issues risks being seen as out of touch.\nVoters interviewed at random in County Cavan said they would vote for candidates who could deliver more street lighting, hospital beds and police. No one mentioned the climate unless prompted.\nConcern over the environment has not evaporated. Activists from Extinction Rebellion, Christian Aid, the National Women\u2019s Council and other groups have been canvassing voters, urging them to raise climate issues with candidates from all parties.\nOpinion polls give the Green party about 8% support, rising to 15% in Dublin, putting it on course to perhaps double or triple its current meagre tally of three D\u00e1il seats.\nThat could be enough to enter into a government led by Fine Gael or Fianna F\u00e1il, big party rivals that are both expected to need smaller parties to form a ruling coalition. Environmentalists hope Green ministers could then drive policy changes in agriculture and transport, which account for most of Ireland\u2019s carbon emissions.\nTate Donnelly, a Green party candidate in Cavan-Monaghan, on the border with Northern Ireland, illustrates the environmental movement\u2019s potential and constraints.\nAt 21, the economics and mathematics student at Trinity University is the youngest candidate running for parliament. An articulate campaigner, he sits on the party\u2019s national executive committee and works with a thinktank on social change. A Twitter video announcing his candidacy has drawn almost 100,000 views.\n\u201cI\u2019m not into the environment, I\u2019m into survival,\u201d Donnelly said in an interview. \u201cClimate change and biodiversity loss represent an existential threat.

Changing course could mean raising carbon taxes, culling cattle herds and banning turf harvesting \u2013 unpopular measures, especially with rural voters.\nDonnelly said Ireland could curb emissions without hurting vulnerable communities. \u201cRural people care about the climate but they\u2019re not been given a way out. People who cut bogs are not doing it to ruin the planet, they\u2019re doing it to make a living.\u201d\nOverhauling the EU\u2019s agriculture policy and finding extra revenues \u2013 such as Apple\u2019s \u20ac14bn tax bill, which the company and the Irish government are both trying to quash in European courts \u2013 could fund a just transition, said Donnelly.\nIt\u2019s a pitch tailored to voters who associate climate activism with urban elites and higher cost of living. Donnelly does not know if it will resonate. \u201cI could do really badly or get elected. I\u2019ve no clue.\u201d\nVeteran climate activists question Ireland\u2019s green credentials. Only six TDs were in the chamber when the D\u00e1il declared the climate and biodiversity emergency. Leo Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael-led government waited until this month to announce a \u201cradical\u201d climate action bill, which promptly withered upon the D\u00e1il\u2019s dissolution.\n\u201cThey\u2019re kicking the can down the road. I don\u2019t think they have any credibility on environmental issues,\u201d said Cara Augustenborg, an environmental scientist who advises the president, Michael Higgins.\nHowever, many voters are taking climate change seriously, partly in response to extreme weather events that have chilled and baked Ireland. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Green waves in recent elections. We should see that trend again,\u201d said Augustenborg.\nFitzmaurice, the TD for Galway-Roscommon, thinks \u2013 and hopes \u2013 she is wrong. As chair of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, he represents people who harvest peat bogs, marshy terrain that for centuries was drained, cut and burned as fuel but whose use in this way is now being phased out because of the emissions.\n\u201cIt would be a disaster for the country if the Green party ended up in government,\u201d said Fitzmaurice. Ireland should not \u201ccrucify\u201d rural communities on the altar of climate change, he added. \u201cEveryone can do their little bit.

The hashtag #jagstannarp\u00e5marken (which translates as #stayontheground) came into use around the same time, as groups sprang up to share tips.\nOther wealthy countries are not immune from such trends: a recent survey of 6,000 people in Germany, France, the UK and the US found 21% had cut back. Such a shift in attitudes makes it all the more disturbing that members of the current government, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have yet to catch up. Asked twice on the radio this week whether people should reduce the number of flights they take, the minister said they should not.\nThe Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has probably done more than anyone else to promote the idea that flying should, wherever possible, be avoided. In August she went to New York on a zero-emissions sailing boat. In Sweden last year, air passenger numbers fell by 5% as rail numbers went up. The German Green party (which topped 20% and doubled its seats in last year\u2019s European elections) aims to make domestic flights obsolete.\nWith new research showing 2019 was the second-hottest year on record on the planet\u2019s surface, and the hottest-ever for the oceans, it is increasingly difficult to understand why any rational person would not be behind all and any measures designed to reduce carbon emissions. Evidence of the growing danger extends from the devastation caused by the Australian bushfires to this week\u2019s report that up to 1 million seabirds were killed in less than a year by a \u201chot blob\u201d in the Pacific Ocean.\nThis context made it particularly troubling to hear a senior UK government minister, and one generally considered to be on the moderate wing of his party, blithely deny that reducing flights is a good idea. Just as bad was the fact that his remarks came only hours after the announcement of a tax holiday and review of air passenger duty as part of a rescue deal to save the regional airline Flybe. Mr Hancock\u2019s comment that \u201cwe should use technology to reduce carbon emissions\u201d could be dismissed as naive if it was not so irresponsible.\nElectric flight is in its infancy and, while there have been significant gains in fuel efficiency, zero-carbon flight remains a remote prospect. Projections of future emissions consistently expect aviation to be responsible for an increasing share of the total, although the industry complains that it is unfairly singled out given that the current figure is 2.5%.\nThe UK, however, is a special case. Aviation is responsible for 7% of emissions now and is expected to overtake all other sources by 2050. Britons are the most frequent flyers to international destinations in the world, although a small minority are responsible for the vast majority of flights; by contrast, 48% reported in a recent government survey that they had not flown at all in the previous year. The US, meanwhile, has by far the heaviest air traffic (including domestic flights) overall, with the International Air Transport Association predicting that China will overtake it in about five years\u2019 time \u2013 and global air traffic expected to double to around 8.2bn passengers annually by 2037.\nNo one wants remote locations such as some of those served by Flybe to be cut off, which is why the handful of routes deemed socially necessary are exempt from European state aid rules. But ministers should promote alternatives wherever possible. Hinting at a reduction in flight taxes when rail fares are rising by 2.7% sends the wrong message.\nIndividuals altering their habits, even in large numbers, will not avert disaster. In a sense the opposite is true: collective action by whole countries, led by governments, to push entire economies into a clean era is the answer. But \u201cflight shame\u201d, along with movements to restrict other carbon-intensive forms of consumption, is still a force for good. The point is not to show that you are better than other people, or to displace anxiety from the public realm into the private one. It is to show the world\u2019s leaders, in business and politics, that we get it: life must change.\n\u2022 This article\u2019s headline was amended on 18 January 2020 to better reflect the content of the article.

I had caused upset to I apologise for that.\u201d\nMorrison then sought to turn the page on the episode by unilaterally declaring \u201cthe time for that discussion is over\u201d.\nMorrison said there was \u201cno argument\u201d about the links \u201cbetween broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world\u201d but it was \u201cnot a credible suggestion\u201d to make a direct connection to any single fire event.\nGlobal heating is leading to longer, hotter, drier summers which experts agree increases bushfires\u2019 frequency and severity.

The Morrison government has said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, will come from accounting \u2013 using carryover credits from meeting earlier Kyoto targets \u2013 and not from practical emissions reduction.\nThe centrepiece of Australia\u2019s policy is a $2.55bn fund to pay polluters to reduce emissions, after the Liberal-National government abolished Australia\u2019s carbon price in 2014.\nAsked about the use of carryover credits, Morrison replied that \u201cpeople can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election\u201d.\n\u201cI know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing.\u201d\nMorrison said the government would not act in a \u201cknee-jerk, crisis or panicked mode\u201d \u2013 likening his refusal to increase ambition on climate change with the steady professionalism of those managing the bushfire emergency.\n\u201cA panic approach and response to anything does not help. It puts people at risk.\n\u201cNot just their livelihoods but, I mean, if you walk out there into the control room you will not see people panicking, you will see people be very professional, very focused on the job they have, talking to each other in a very professional way and getting the job done.

But despite the sustained political pressure, AGL has shown no interest in selling the asset.\nAfter growing frustration with energy companies, the government last year produced the so-called \u201cbig stick\u201d package which created a power to break up energy companies if they engaged in price gouging, which some energy experts have long suspected was a mechanism to remove Liddell from AGL\u2019s ownership.\nThe government was forced to pull the package because it would have to cop a Greens/Labor amendment in the House that would prohibit taxpayer support for new coal-fired power.

It has certainly felt that way in Britain at times, during three and a half years of frenzied stalemate over Brexit. But instead of a time-out, the country faces the first December general election for almost 100 years. As voters are called to the polling booths once again, a third national vote in under four years points to a democracy in crisis rather than one in rude health.\nThe shortcomings of our political culture and institutions have been brutally exposed since 2016. An adversarial system found itself unable, in a hung parliament, to resolve a nation-defining issue that transcended normal party politics. The flames of discord have been fanned on social media and public opinion has become dangerously polarised. The courts were obliged to intervene as a prime minister lacking a popular mandate played fast and loose with the constitution.\nBrexit is not the only area of paralysis and dysfunction in the body politic. Successive parliaments have shown a shaming inability to find cross-party unity in dealing with the crisis in social care, which will deepen as the population ages. When it comes to the climate emergency, optimistic dates for achieving net-zero emissions targets have been set by all the main parties, but the roadmap to that outcome remains vague at best. Meanwhile, our first-past-the-post voting system continues to distort election outcomes, creating seats so safe that the vitality is sucked out of local democracy and parliamentary majorities are delivered by a minority share of the vote. Online, hopes that the digital age might unleash a new era of participatory democracy have given way to concern over the bullying, violent tone of much debate and the effect of unregulated political content on Facebook and other platforms.\nConfronted with huge challenges, Britain needs a better, more inclusive and less polarised debate. The call from organisations across civil society to rethink and reform the way we do politics, published in the Guardian this week, is therefore welcome.

Its members would be selected at random, as for jury service. They would convene over the course of two years, before making proposals on democratic and constitutional reform. Parliament would be mandated to act on their recommendations.\nThe merits of this kind of approach have already been demonstrated in Ireland, where a randomly selected assembly of 99 citizens met over an 18-month period and came to a consensus on the first reforms to abortion laws for 35 years. Their proposals were accepted by parliament and eventually endorsed by the public, in a referendum notable for the civility with which it was conducted.\nRuth Fox, the director of the Hansard Society, has warned that \u201cthe public reputation of parliament and MPs is at a nadir\u201d. A special assembly, running in tandem with the new parliament, could help detoxify troubled times and provide a bridge between Westminster and the public. Most importantly, by creating the circumstances for informed dialogue between people from diverse backgrounds holding different views, it could showcase the political virtues of tolerance and compromise.

News that F1 is close to signing a deal for a Saudi Grand Prix is an enduring reminder that nothing the sport says about anything at all other than money should ever be taken remotely seriously.\nDo recall that it was not even two years ago that F1\u2019s owners, Liberty Media, were indulging in a bout of public self-congratulation for getting rid of the scantily clad grid girls in the wake of the #MeToo movement\u2019s explosion. \u201cWe feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values,\u201d sniffed F1\u2019s commercial managing director at the time, \u201cand is clearly at odds with modern\u2011day societal norms\u201d.\nTo the society of Saudi Arabia then, one of the most brutally repressive on earth, where women were permitted to drive only 18 months ago, allowed to travel without permission from a male relative only six months ago, and where women\u2019s rights activists are imprisoned in solitary confinement and reportedly tortured. And so on, and so on, at great length. That said, the Saudi ruling tyrants are very rich. So of course Formula One is going to race here, and of course we must expect them to try and make further hay about how they\u2019re leading the way opening up a new modern era for the kingdom, or something.\nAnd yet \u2026 What a load of old bollocks. Indeed, all of a sudden, who can really say grid girls represent some retrograde force of oppression? Let\u2019s face it \u2013 bikini-clad women are very much against Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201csocietal norms\u201d, to quote a phrase. After all, the presence of a bikini-clad lovely would, on a Saudi circuit, be regarded as an act of vast political defiance, as opposed to something that lots of powerful businessmen are going to decide is shameful because it makes them look good for five minutes while Harvey Weinstein\u2019s in the news.", "label": 0}, "text-267": {"text": "Sport fans, how is the coronavirus affecting you?\nEvery day that passes brings more announcements about sporting events being postponed, cancelled or played in empty stadiums.

I refuse to let a nude video stop me from running for office\nWhen Representative Katie Hill\u2019s nude photos were leaked online, I watched with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I saw them posted across every social media platform. I saw her naked body, saw it commented upon and reviewed, criticized.\nI was sitting on my couch and wrote a quick tweet:\n\u201cAlmost every woman I know has taken nudes at sometime in her life. As more women under 40 run for office, we are going to have to figure out how to stand together and say it\u2019s the leaking of them, not the taking of them, that is shameful.\u201d\nThe tweet got 1,000 likes quickly. The next day it had 34,000. I watched people in the comments tell the stories about how nude photos had been used against them. I watched many people, mostly men, repeatedly blame women for sharing nudes, instead of blaming the people who leaked them.\nBy the time I woke up on Wednesday morning, the tweet had almost 100,000 likes. I felt something in me burst like a bubble. I drafted a post on Facebook to share something I had only ever told my closest friends \u2013 I cared so deeply about this issue because it was my story, too.\nI was only 19, and desperate for a roommate when I met the man who would go on to get me very drunk, film me without consent and release the evidence.\nI am 32 now and I can still feel the sensation of how it felt to have my world crumble around me. My boyfriend left me. I was forced out of the online community where I\u2019d found a home. I was utterly, hopelessly alone. I even contemplated killing myself, especially as this man threatened to show my parents the video.\nHe made DVDs and sent me a copy.\nWhen I saw it, I threw up.\nI\u2019ve built a life for myself in politics. I\u2019ve moved on. I have a partner I love and an adorable house. Two cats and a dog. A great job.\nI\u2019ve run dozens of people for office. But I never let myself consider running for a seat of my own. All I could imagine was the humiliation I would feel if this man used that opportunity to finally release my secret to the world.\nAs the jobs I\u2019ve gotten have become higher profile, I had near-constant anxiety that today, tomorrow, next Tuesday might be the day I lost everything again.\nThe day I wrote my Facebook post, texts, DMs and calls kept coming in with wave after wave of support. It felt good to hear some things: this was assault. I didn\u2019t deserve the shame I was carrying. He was in the wrong.\nBut what felt even better, almost magical, to hear, was comment after comment that said something familiar: me too.\nWoman after woman who were holding themselves back, who were not running for office, not going to school, not starting a business because someone \u2013 in some dark corner of the internet, or an abusive ex, or a high school fling \u2013 had taken away their choice. Released their nude photos. Put videos on revenge porn sites.\nThis really isn\u2019t about Katie Hill. It\u2019s about the long fight women have had to have agency over our own bodies.\nIt\u2019s about how we are asked to be both the virgin and the whore. It\u2019s about how women still aren\u2019t allowed to own our sexuality.\nAnd it\u2019s really, really about the fact that nudes are an expected part of 21st century romance. In the dark teenage drama Euphoria on HBO, the main character explains this beautifully. Exchanging naked photos and snaps is just how many young people build intimacy in a digital world that increasingly lacks it.\nIt is not enough to tell women in their 20s and 30s that they just shouldn\u2019t send nudes. A great number of us already have. We shouldn\u2019t have to feel shame that we trusted someone, that we wanted to feel closer to them. Or that we weren\u2019t given a choice.\nSharing someone\u2019s private photos without their consent is a violation of their privacy and their trust.

This is European arrest warrant lite,\u201d said the source.\nOne complication is that some EU member states, such as Germany, have a constitutional bar against extraditing their nationals to non-EU countries. \u201cTheir view is if they can\u2019t get justice at home, they are not going to get it anywhere else,\u201d said the source. \nWhen Britain left the EU on 31 January, three EU countries \u2013 Germany, Austria and Slovenia \u2013 announced they would stop surrendering their nationals to British law enforcement. Since 2009, there have been six people from those countries extradited to the UK. Conversely it could mean the UK becomes a safe haven for EU criminals.\nUnder the current arrangements, police forces, prosecutors and the National Crime Agency can apply for an EAW to effect a fast extradition of a criminal suspect from any EU member state, and likewise EU countries can apply to the UK to return fugitives. The European commission has previously claimed that average extradition times have been reduced from one year to less than two months through the use of the EAW.\nFrom 2009/2010 to 2017/2018, the UK returned 9,853 EU nationals to their home states to face justice, and brought back 1,271 Britons over the same period.\nBefore the arrest warrant existed it took 10 years to extradite Rachid Ramda from Britain to France over his role in the 1995 Paris metro bombing. In 2005 it took just 56 days to bring the failed 21/7 London tube bomber Hussain Osman back from Italy to London using an arrest warrant.\nYvette Cooper MP, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s new proposals for security cooperation with the EU are extremely worrying.\n\u201cThe announcement today made it plain that the UK is no longer seeking the kind of access to vital EU databases and security tools that would replicate our existing relationship, despite its own analysis stating repeatedly that failing to participate in existing tools would mean a serious loss of capability with damaging consequences for public safety.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s new red lines make it exceedingly difficult for anything more than the standard third-country relationship with the EU on security cooperation to be negotiated. That is not good enough and marks a huge scaling back in ambition. \n\u201cThe government only have six months before our existing security arrangements run out but the committee was told that it could take up to 18 months to ratify a new security treaty and possibly much longer for new extradition arrangements to replace the European arrest warrant.\n\u201cIt is completely astounding that the government says that these new plans will make the country safer when we have been told time and time again by senior police officers and security experts that the opposite is true.\u201d\nAfter the EU referendum, the then NCA deputy director general, David Armond, said losing the EAW would be a \u201ctricky\u201d issue.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t stay in that we\u2019ve got to negotiate a series of new treaties with overseas territories about what extradition will look like,\u201d he said.\nStephen Doughty, a Labour MP and member of the home affairs select committee, said: \u201cIt is extraordinary that the government is willing to put the security and safety of our citizens at risk \u2013 all in the name of ideological obsession \u2013 by pulling out of the European arrest warrant.\n\u201cIt is also deeply irresponsible to threaten to walk away from talks in June \u2013 which would not only threaten our economy, but also our safety and security. What price are they willing to pay? Or is it all an idle threat?\u201d\nThe Brexit spokesman for the the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, the deputy assistant commissioner Richard Martin, said: \u201cThroughout the Brexit process police have been clear that we want to retain the capabilities of the EU tools we currently use and that remains the case.\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the government and EU partners in support of a deal that maintains close cooperation \u2013 in the interests of all UK and European citizens.\u201d\nLawmakers have previously warned that any delay in agreeing an extradition treaty could result in a return to criminals hiding out on the \u201cCosta del Crime\u201d to escape justice. The EU extradition treaty with Norway and Iceland took 13 years to enforce after it was signed in 2006, although both sides will want a post-Brexit agreement in place much faster.\nThe UK is not seeking membership of Eurojust, an EU agency that works to coordinate investigations and prosecutions between EU member states when dealing with cross-border crime, the future relationship dossier says.\nIn addition, the government says it wants access to information-sharing and exchange systems \u201csimilar\u201d to those in place now, but stops short of seeking ongoing access to current arrangements including the Schengen information system II (SIS II), the real-time alert mechanism for fugitives, the European criminal records information system (ECRIS) and the Prum system used for DNA exchanges.\nThe Home Office said the safety and security of UK citizens is the government\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d and the alternative arrangements it was seeking would include greater safeguards than those within the European Arrest Warrant.\n\u201cThe UK will continue to be one of the safest countries in the world,\u201d a spokesperson said.", "label": 0}, "text-270": {"text": "The idea to privatise Medicare is bizarre. We should treasure our public health system\nLike most people, during my 20s and 30s my experience with the health system was largely routine \u2013 GP visits, the occasional emergency ward appearance for a broken leg (mixed indoor netball is a tough sport). I was healthy and so didn\u2019t really think much about the workings of the health system until something unexpected occurred \u2013 the birth of our second child, who has Down\u2019s syndrome.\nThe first week after her birth as we waited for test results and confirmation of the diagnosis was as stressful a time my wife and I have ever experienced.\nFortunately our daughter Emma lay peacefully in her humidicrib in the Canberra hospital neonatal ICU (and as an aside, if there are any true heroes walking among us it is the nurses who work in those wards).\nSo small and in need of warmth was she that I was rarely able to hold her, and I felt utterly useless and disconnected. As we had named her after one of our favourite literary characters, my way to bond with her was to spend nights in the dimly lit ICU sitting next to her humidicrib, tearfully and softly reading the Jane Austen novel to her.\nSo yeah. I was pretty much a wreck. And among the worries I had about her future was the wonder of how we were going to pay for it all.\nIn retrospect it was a slightly dopey thought \u2013 perhaps stemming from too much infiltration of US TV into my system where I was reacting like someone who, after witnessing a crime, thinks to dial 911.\nSickness in the US is almost a synonym for bankruptcy\nI had little understanding of what Down\u2019s syndrome was: what care would be required, what operations would be needed (we were very lucky, in that she did not require any surgery to repair her heart or intestines which can often be the case for babies with DS)? But above it all I kept thinking, cripes, how are we going to pay for it?\nI guess I can be excused due to the stress, but it didn\u2019t occur to me until later that the very place in which I was having those worries and where my daughter was receiving amazing care was a public hospital \u2013 and that we of course do not live in the US \u2013 we have Medicare.\nAnd let us all pause and give thanks that we do.\nNow sure, there have in the 13 years since been numerous private medical expenses \u2013 mostly specialists \u2013 ophthalmologists, ear, nose and throat specialists and the like. And there have of course been out-of-pocket expenses.\nBut mostly the public system has been there \u2013 either firstly through TherapyACT, or then the NDIS.\nAnd when things went bad \u2013 such as in her first two years when she was hospitalised each winter with bronchiolitis and had be put on a respirator to keep her oxygen levels up \u2013 there we were once again in the Canberra hospital getting great care.\nIn the 2016 election the big issue was the supposed desire of the Liberal party to privatise Medicare. It was never a stated policy, and the ALP had to face a lot of questioning over how truthful they were being. There were suggestions that it could never happen but the scare campaign was enough to get the ALP very close to winning government.\nAustralians overwhelmingly love Medicare. And they should. And they overwhelmingly hate private health insurance. And they are right to.\nMostly private health care is now a thing taken out to avoid paying the Medicare levy surcharge. And more and more what is being offered is insurance with a myriad of exclusions and excess co-payments.\nLittle wonder that young people are leaving the private health system.\nBizarrely though as well this week came the suggestion from the managing director of private health insurer NIB, Mark Fitzgibbon, in an opinion piece in the AFR that the government should scrap Medicare and \u201cmake private health insurance compulsory for all Australians with taxation devoted to subsidising the premiums for those who would otherwise be left behind.\u201d\nAhh yes, privatising Medicare. Welcome back.\nIs there any policy issue that the business sector doesn\u2019t believe can be solved by privatisation? Especially when that privatisation will most benefit the business run by the person promoting it?\nThere actually has already been a recent quasi-privatising of the health system. The NDIS saw the end of the very good care people received from public health groups such as TherapyACT and a switch to having to find private therapists (often those who had worked for organisations like TherapyACT) who are then paid by through the NDIS.\nI am sure many have benefited from the NDIS, but I have not found too many benefits that I would not have been as efficiently delivered by just providing the public health sector with the extra money that now goes into the NDIS.\nBut this is the heart of the argument \u2013 the belief that the private sector delivers things better. And yet we know this is a belief better observed in economic textbooks from the 1980s than from reality.\nThe US\u2019s largely privatised health system is inefficient and so disgracefully costly that sickness in the US is almost a synonym for bankruptcy.\nWe know the current government is committed to reducing expenditure and this of course will have to hit the health system.\nI suspect this will manifest itself in a push for more NDIS style \u201cvoucher systems\u201d which is essentially a privatisation by stealth and for ever-more \u201cincentives\u201d for people to join private health insurance.\nWhat is also clear is that the 2016 \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign might have lacked substance but the implicit desire to prefer the private sector over the public sector is a feature of conservative governments either in nations with strong public system like Australia and the UK, or those without like the US.\nAnd it is a desire that always needs to be fought against by all of us for whom the public health system is so treasured.\n\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia", "label": 0}, "text-271": {"text": "Trump issues Earth Day message without mentioning climate change\nDonald Trump issued on Monday an Earth Day proclamation that omitted any mention of climate change or the cavalcade of environmental threats posed by deforestation, species loss and plastic pollution.

As Mental Health Awareness Week kicks off on 13 May, charities and consumer groups are urging those in debt to seek help early to avoid a downward spiral in their health and wellbeing.\nDebt is often a major factor for those suffering with stress and anxiety, and the two issues can feed into each other, creating a vicious cycle.\nJames McNicol, 44, has personal experience of this. McNicol is self-employed with a computer repair business but says he struggles with the fluctuations in workload and cashflow. Over the past five years he has built up significant debts. During quiet periods McNicol worries about money, which has a knock-on effect on his sleep and mood.\nMcNicol has never been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but his wife Paula, a pharmacy assistant, was concerned at the rapid decline in his mental health. Finally in January this year they sought help to get their finances back on track. The couple first took advice through the charity Christians Against Poverty, which put them in touch with an ethical debt management organisation.\n\u201cI was in a bad place. I was worrying about my debts and wasn\u2019t focusing on my business. This meant less work was coming in. It was a downward spiral and it had gone on for years,\u201d says McNicol, who lives in Maidstone in Kent.\n\u201cJust getting a debt management plan in place and speaking to someone has been like a massive weight lifted. It will take years to clear the debts but now I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\u201cI\u2019d never spoken to anyone about my debt or my mental health before. It was difficult at first. But after taking that first step, things were so much better.\u201d\nThe situation is often compounded by the double stigma around mental health and our money, says Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. \u201cIt can make it difficult for people to open up about what they are going through and seek help. This has to change as it is destroying lives.\u201d\nResearch published by the institute in March this year found a strong correlation between debt and mental health, with those with mental health problems three times more likely to be in debt. Almost half \u2013 46% \u2013 of all people in debt said they also faced a mental health problem.\nUndy has urged the government and regulators to do more to ensure the financial services and debt collection industries support those falling into debt, particularly where the problems are compounded by a mental health condition.\nMcNicol feels there is a direct link for him between feeling in control of his finances and his wellbeing. This is something echoed strongly in a recent survey conducted by the consumer website Topcashback. As well as 35% of people saying they regularly worry about money so much it affects their mental health, it also found that those in debt felt out of their depth when trying to get their finances sorted out. For almost seven in 10 people \u2013 67% \u2013 a key element of feeling \u201cfinancially well\u201d was being in control of their money and not overspending.\nDr Jed Boardman is lead for social inclusion at the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He says: \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve come a long way and there is less stigma around mental health and debt problems, for those struggling, they often see it as a personal failure. Many talk about the shame associated with debt, so they don\u2019t want to speak up even when they are in crisis. If they are already anxious or depressed, it can be hard to keep things in perspective.\u201d\nIf you are struggling to manage your debts, or your finances feel out of control, it is important to take action quickly. Debt advice charities such as National Debtline and StepChange are free and impartial, and can help you (or someone acting on your behalf if you feel unable to do so) negotiate with your creditors. If you choose to inform your creditors of a mental health issue, you can use a \u201cdebt and mental health evidence form\u201d, which is a way of accessing the support and forbearance that is available.\nUnder the lending code followed by most banks, building societies and credit card companies, creditors are required to treat those in debt, and particularly those with mental health issues, sympathetically and help find solutions by way of a reasonable repayment plan.\nNational Debtline says one in seven callers cites mental health problems as the reason they got into debt.

He also became prone to spending sprees.\n\u201cThe problem went on for years after I got my job, and I ended up in a mess with significant debts,\u201d says Wright. \u201cI became withdrawn, depressed and irritable and it affected my relationships at work and with my partner. I was worried about my debts, but then I was buying things on impulse. In January this year a colleague, who noticed a change in my behaviour, asked if I was OK, and I just broke down.\n\u201cIt was the best thing that could have happened. My colleagues were so supportive. I got in touch with a debt management group and I\u2019m on the right path to getting my debts cleared through an IVA [individual voluntary arrangement].

Also once again, there are a couple of catches.\nFor one, all developed countries will need to de-industrialize in order to slash carbon dioxide emissions virtually to zero by 2030 in order to prevent average planetary temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above what they were in 1820.\nIncidentally, that was still during the end of the Little Ice Age, shortly after Washington\u2019s troops suffered brutally cold temperatures at Valley Forge in 1777, and Napoleon\u2019s beat a frigid retreat from Moscow in 1812. Conditions were far more comfortable - even warmer than now - about one thousand years ago during the Medieval Warm Period, and also during the Roman Warm Period one thousand years before then.\nThe other requirement to avoid climate Armageddon is to compel those de-industrializing wealthy nations to give trillions of dollars in \u201cadaptation, mitigation and compensation\u201d money to poor countries they have \"victimized\" by climate change. China, the world\u2019s largest CO2-emitter, would be given a pass on this.\nFirst to get in the cue for this free money was the nation of Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean following U.N. 1988 warnings that the tropical archipelago paradise along with more than 200,000 inhabitants would become submerged by rising sea levels within three decades.\nRepublic of Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed upped the alarm amps in 2009, telling the U.N. General Assembly Summit on Climate Change. \"You know that with a sea-level rise of 1.5 meters, hundreds of millions of people will be dead.\"\nAgain, just last year, Maldives Energy and Environment Minister demanded immediate access to U.N. Green Climate Fund aid before it is too late. He admonished, \"There\u2019s no use having a fund somewhere if you can\u2019t access it quickly.\"\nAnd after all, we should understand the urgency. Those funds are desperately needed to pay for the construction of a new a $400 million two-mile-long sea level runway at the Maldives International Airport \u2013 one large enough to accommodate the Airbus A380 jetliner, the world\u2019s biggest passenger aircraft. Its Chinese contracting firm is also building a massive new aviation fuel farm and cargo complex.\nThe project apparently needs to be completed as rapidly as possible to evacuate the island nation\u2019s current 400,000 people when those waters suddenly rise.\nOn the other hand, it may not be wise to purchase advance discount-priced evacuation airline tickets just yet. Research conducted by University of Auckland, New Zealand scientists between 1971 and 2014 indicates that the Maldives and other coral island land areas in the region are actually getting larger \u2013 not shrinking.\nMeanwhile, global sea levels have been rising at a relatively constant rate of seven inches per century without acceleration ever since that last little ice age ended\u00a0- and before the Industrial Revolution which introduced CO2-belching smokestacks and SUVs began.\nAverage global temperatures have also blissfully risen by about half of a degree since that time, and will likely to continue to do so with no help from us or permission from the U.N. until the next in an observed pattern series of true 90,000-year-long Ice Ages occurs in a few thousand more years.\nSo yes, Earth\u2019s natural climate really does change. Regarding any positive political climate change, we can only hope to be so fortunate.\nAs U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) official Ottmar Edenhofer candidly explained in November, 2010: \" . . . one has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. Instead, climate change policy is about how we redistribute de facto the world\u2019s wealth . . . \"\nTrue to form, based upon repeatedly unreliable climate model predictions, IPCC\u2019s latest Special Report claims governments worldwide must make \"unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" involving \"far-reaching\" transitions in land, energy, buildings, transport, and cities.\nVirtually all of this is based upon unfounded representations that we are experiencing a known human-caused climate crisis, a claim based upon speculative theories, contrived data, and laughably exaggerated modeling predictions that even IPCC reports admit (in fine print) can\u2019t be trusted.\nThe senselessly alarmist climate-reality COP-out in Poland concludes with an ultimatum we have heard numerous times before. America must immediately de-industrialize, pay global restitution for its unfair fossil-driven capitalist prosperity, and put the U.N. in charge of our energy, economic, and societal policy prerogatives.\nIt is way past time to realize that none of this is really about protecting the planet from man-made climate change.\nIt never was.\n[Originally Published at Newsmax]", "label": 1}, "text-275": {"text": "Governors' push to reopen states risks second wave of infection, experts warn\nUS governors seeking to relax public health restrictions on the activity of people and businesses are acting prematurely and risk inciting a second, more damaging wave of infections from the coronavirus pandemic, public health experts have warned.\nA wave of reopenings is set to spread across the south and midwest of the US, led by Republican governors.\nGeorgia has announced it will allow the resumption of some businesses, such as barbershops and nail salons on Friday and restaurants next week, while certain beaches in Florida have already reopened to the public. Oklahoma is also set to lift restrictions on some businesses, South Carolina beaches and retail stores will reopen next week with social distancing guidelines and Nebraska is set to allow dental work and scheduled surgeries within the next two weeks.\nBrian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s governor, has said that he believes \u201cour citizens are ready for this\u201d and will practice social distancing advice to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Donald Trump, who previously claimed to have complete authority over the reopening of states, is now largely leaving the issue to governors. Although the president has said he \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with Kemp\u2019s position, he has called on protesters to \u201cliberate\u201d other Democratic-controlled states from strict lockdown orders.\nBut infectious disease experts have warned that it is too early to scale down stay-at-home orders. A lack of testing is a critical issue \u2013 about 500,000 people a day need to be tested across the US in order to gradually restart the American economy, according to a Harvard estimate. But the actual testing rate lags far below that, at around 150,000 tests a day.\nExperts say many Americans have quickly learned new codes of behavior by keeping their distance from others, washing their hands and, increasingly, wearing masks. But a lack of swabs and reagents needed for tests, as well as a lack of contact tracing to track infections, makes it difficult to safely resume normal life.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the US is ready, there are 50 states all at different points in their epidemic,\u201d said Yanis Ben Amor, executive director of the Center for Sustainable Development in the Earth Institute. \u201cWe aren\u2019t diagnosing enough people and if we don\u2019t have a testing system in place it will flare up again badly. We just don\u2019t have that testing system and as a human being I\u2019m deeply concerned about the consequences for people who think their governor is saying it\u2019s safe now.\u201d\nThe push by some governors to reopen doesn\u2019t come with much public support.\nAbout eight in 10 Americans support measures to limit gatherings, polling has found, with a majority feeling it\u2019s too soon to lift restrictions. This view is echoed by various mayors \u2013 Georgia\u2019s reopening was criticized as \u201creckless, premature and dangerous\u201d by Van Johnson, mayor of Savannah.\nCountries such as Switzerland, Austria and France have tentatively outlined plans for the gradual restarting of business and social activities and the US government has provided advice to states on when to do likewise.\nBut Ben Amor said states like Georgia, which is still reporting significant numbers of infections, do not meet the criteria as yet.\n\u201cWhy the hell is Georgia opening when it isn\u2019t ticking the box of phase one?\u201d he said. \u201cIt still has too many cases. There needs to be a strong, informed approach from the federal government rather than just let the states police themselves.\u201d\nWhile infections and hospitalizations are showing signs of plateauing, the US will probably, at some point, be hit with a second wave of Covid-19 infections and experts say the approach taken in reopening the economy and implementing mass testing will be crucial in determining the severity of this second peak.Recent modeling done by researchers at MIT, based upon the experiences of China and Italy, has found that an early reopening will spell disaster. A draft paper by the researchers warns \u201crelaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.\u201dIf restrictions are lifted now it may take a month before a surge in new infections is apparent, a window of time that may make states feel confident in further loosening lockdown conditions. This may well lead to an attritional bout of \u201cwhack a mole\u201d where states loosen and then tighten restrictions as new cases crop up, said Andy Slavitt, a former healthcare official under Barack Obama.\nSlavitt said in the absence of consistent federal leadership the public should listen to high-profile public health figures such as Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, and be prepared for long-term changes to the rhythm of everyday life.\n\u201cUntil we have herd immunity and a safe vaccine that can be distributed to everyone in the country we will be in this altered state,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither will be a silver bullet, though, so maybe older and sicker people will have to socially distance for a certain time in the year on an ongoing basis.

Maybe we wear masks a little more.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-276": {"text": "Zali Steggall to unveil climate change bill and push for a conscience vote for MPs\nThe woman who toppled Tony Abbott in Warringah at the last election on a platform of climate change action now has the whole parliament in her sights as she seeks bipartisan support for a climate change framework bill aimed at transitioning Australia to a decarbonised economy.\nZali Steggall \u2013 along with her fellow crossbenchers Rebekah Sharkie, Helen Haines and Andrew Wilkie \u2013 will release the climate change national framework for adaption and mitigation bill on Monday, ahead of its introduction to the parliament in March.\nSteggall and the crossbench have begun a conscience vote campaign online and within their communities. They hope to win over enough government MPs to see the bill, which has been modelled on existing legislation in the UK, New Zealand and Ireland, pass in Australia.\nHowever, the crossbench faces an uphill battle, with Scott Morrison declaring just last week he would not be \u201cbullied\u2019 into more action on climate change. \nSteggall has previously called on the self-styled \u201cmodern Liberals\u201d to support the legislation, which she said became imperative following the summer of unprecedented bushfires and resulting hazardous air quality that left communities reeling.\nWith the government\u2019s party room once again at war over climate policy, Steggall said it was time to let individual MPs speak for their communities rather than toe a party line.\n\u201cThe bill will be circulated to all MPs as well as business, environmental and relevant stakeholder groups on Monday,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is time to take the party politics out of climate policy. It is a matter of principle that we should all be committed to a safer future. I am urging for a conscience vote when I present the bill on March 23 as a private member\u2019s bill. Now is the time for a rational approach to climate change.\u201d\nThe crossbench group, working with climate action organisations, has already launched petitions calling on MPs to be allowed a conscience vote on the legislation once it is introduced.\nWithout a conscience vote, the bill is doomed to fail, with the government holding the numbers in the lower chamber.\nSteggall said the events of the summer, on top of the climate impacts Australia was already suffering through, should be enough to prompt MPs to follow their conscience and vote on behalf of their constituents.\n\u201cThis bill is a sensible and bipartisan approach to safeguarding Australia\u2019s future against the impacts of climate change,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe devastating fires that ripped through Australia over summer; the drought; and our deteriorating air pollution have shown how the impacts of climate change are a real threat to our way of life.\u201d\nDave Sharma in Wentworth, Tim Wilson in Goldstein and Jason Falinski in Mackellar, as well as Brisbane\u2019s Trevor Evans and North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman are being targeted as potential allies.

After all, as the second largest freshwater lake in the world, it should be able to support the fish and the people that depend on its resources.\nBut the fact that fish farming is fast expanding here highlights a worrying trend \u2013 that the fish population in Lake Victoria has been in steady decline and the quality of what is being caught has been going down too, jeopardising the livelihoods of millions.\nOverfishing, pollution and the invasive water hyacinth plant, among other factors, are to blame for the decline. The situation is so bad that cheap tilapia imports from China are now sold in the lake city of Kisumu, edging out local fishmongers.\nThe fishermen are finding it difficult to compete. These fish, from thousands of miles away, are cheaper than those caught just down the road in the lake.\nNow villagers are turning to farming to address the shortages, something which would have been inconceivable only a few years ago.\n\u201cWe are left with no choice but to farm fish in the ponds now,\u201d says John Obuom, from Kamulla village in the Store Pamba area of Kisumu county.\nWith his wife Pauline Achieng, Obuom has successfully reared catfish since 2018 in five ponds on their three-acre plot.

High school and university students regularly visit his farm to learn about how sustainable agriculture works in practice.\nObuom is now part of a year-long, ongoing study on agricultural finance, through what is known as the financial diary tool.\n\u201cThis tool will show how spending patterns influence climate-smart agricultural practices,\u201d says Anthony Musyimi, an agriculture masters student at the University of Nairobi.\nThe financial diary tool is a joint effort between the University of Nairobi, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands and CCAFS \u2013 a research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security.\nThis study is looking at the financial data of 122 households in the Nyando Basin, including Kisumu county.\nMusyimi has been collecting data from Obuom for the past 48 weeks. He will conclude his findings this month, a year after he began.\nObuom uses nutrient-rich waste water from his fish ponds to irrigate his crops. The water has also enabled him to put up 10 beehives, each of which yields between eight and 10 litres of honey every three to four months.\n\u201cBees cannot survive without water,\u201d he says.\nAnd for women of the local Luo community, once banned from owning a boat or even entering the waters in the lake region, there are opportunities to get involved. They can now raise fish in a pond without breaking any cultural taboos, supplementing their household incomes.\nChris Macoloo, the Africa regional director for World Neighbors, maintains that using fish ponds has advantages over open-water artisanal fishing, because the latter \u201cis more of a hunter-gatherer system, with no prior knowledge of the expected quantity of catch\u201d.\nThe development organisation has trained farmers in modern integrated farming techniques.

The battle over the tax was the most expensive (US$45 million) in state history for a ballot measure. And this was a proposal for a US$15 per tonne tax in 2020, rising only US$2 per year above the rate of inflation until the state achieves its emission goals (which may or may not be affected by the tax at that lower rate).\n\nHere in Alberta, we\u2019re already paying $30/tonne of GHG emissions, and most likely, will be forced to bump that in $10 increments to $50/tonne in 2022. Clearly, jurisdictions in the U.S. will not impose similar taxes on themselves.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t only the Washington State rejection that brought the pain on climate change to U.S. politicians. The pro-carbon tax Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, known as the Climate Solutions Caucus, was decimated at the polls. Carlos Curbelo, an up-and-coming congressman from Florida lost his reelection bid in part because of his support for a carbon tax. Grover Norquist, the head of the influential Americans for Tax Reform, said \u201cCurbelo could and should have been reelected, but he was talked into pushing an energy tax on all Americans\u2014the so-called carbon tax\u2014and as a result, voters kicked him out of office.\u201d\n\nAgain, Curbelo\u2019s proposed tax of US$23/tonne of GHG emissions is equivalent to what Alberta pays today, before the federal price escalator catches up to us in 2021. Others beside Curbelo got the hook as well: Barbara Comstock (VA), Scott Taylor (VA), Daniel Donovan (NY) and Peter Roskam (IL) all lost their races. Conservative members of the Climate Solutions Caucus went down with Curbelo.\n\nIn another telling loss to the \u201ctax carbon crowd and build renewables,\u201d a proposition in Arizona (Proposition 127) fell on election day, despite millions in backing from billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. That proposition would have mandated the growth of renewable energy sources (wind and solar) to 50 per cent of energy production by 2030.\n\nAnd here at home, carbon tax conflict has escalated to nearly unbelievable levels, with Maclean's calling the five leading opponents of carbon taxation \u201cThe Resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere used to be Conservatives who favoured putting a price on carbon,\u201d wrote Paul Wells. \u201cThey have lost in a rout.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason for that, as Canadian jurisdictions have been utterly unwilling to enact anything close to theoretically-sound carbon tax, turning virtually all of them into government cash grabs.\n\nOne hopes Premier Notley and Prime Minister Trudeau are paying attention and learning just how many people dislike their carbon taxes.

They could take this further by clearly distinguishing between corporate globalisation, which has disproportionately benefited an elite, and the genuine progressive international cooperation that we all desire.\nThe centre is nevertheless still key to building the coalitions that lead to political success, but if we want to see a progressive government the centre must recognise, like the left, that it cannot win on its own. What is required is a constructive and radical coalition between a firm, principled democratic left and the progressive centre. This is a point that seems to be recognised by the current Labour leadership contenders, but which of the four can deliver it?\nWhoever is elected will be under immediate pressure to ditch the left, but this will ultimately result in ineffective opposition. Rebecca Long-Bailey, coming from both the left and north, is in by the far better position to resist such pressure and provide effective leadership.

In the main they voted for Boris Johnson instead. Now Johnson shows all the signs of being a very poor public servant indeed, but at least pursuing ideas for their own sake will not get in his way. He is at least capable of public service in a way that the ideologue is not. Finally, the Tory party has its share of ideologues; but, whatever they may think, they do not call the shots.

But the chancellor\u2019s promotion of cigarettes and alcohol exposes the government\u2019s failure to take a joined-up approach to tackling stalled life expectancy and the obscene 18-year healthy life expectancy gap between the wealthiest and poorest parts of the country. The announcement shows how different parts of government are so buried in their own silos that they either don\u2019t see or don\u2019t care about the wider harm they are doing.\nThis policy failure was rammed home the same day by the Health Foundation, with a report spelling out that the only way to deliver substantial improvements in health is concerted government action to tackle the social, economic and environmental conditions in which we live.\nThe foundation\u2019s plea for good health to become a key measure of successful government would be transformative. New Zealand is showing the way: its first wellbeing budget was published this year, and its five priorities include taking mental health seriously, improving child wellbeing and reshaping the economy to spread the benefits.\nMaking health a measure of our collective success is a brilliantly simple idea. It would be a goal we could all could benefit from and understand. With air pollution an important factor, it would seamlessly dovetail with action on climate change.\nLocal government would have a big role to play, particularly in creating environments that support children\u2019s physical and mental health. Reopening hundreds of Sure Start centres would be a good place to begin.\nFor a government keen on infrastructure projects, affordable and accessible transport systems could be a vote winner. But they do not have to be state of the art rapid transport to make a difference; running decent bus services between deprived coastal towns and major cities could have a massive impact.\nBut despite endless examples in the UK and across the world of smart things that could improve health and wellbeing, over the past decade our government has been unwavering in its determination to prioritise short-term crisis management, upward wealth redistribution and headline-grabbing proposals over long-term improvements in people\u2019s lives. In-work and child poverty are the result. Health Foundation analysis of government figures indicates child poverty will keep rising for at least five more years on the back of yet more cuts to working age welfare support.\nSpending on homelessness perfectly encapsulates the dysfunctional way Conservative governments have approached spending. Analysis by the Guardian and the housing charity Shelter in January found that councils across England spent \u00a3997m on temporary accommodation in 2017-18, a 71% increase on the \u00a3584m in 2012-13, as more people have been driven on to the streets by benefit cuts, reductions in local authority housing spending and erosion of other services such as addiction treatment. On average, the lives of rough sleepers are 30 years shorter.\nPutting health and wellbeing at the heart of government policy would benefit everybody, provide levers on everything from the economy to the environment and encourage joined-up, long-term policies.

In order to ensure some equivalence between measurements from mercury thermometers and electronic probes it is standard practice for the one-second readings from electronic probes to be averaged over a one-minute period, or in the case of the US National Weather Service the averaging of the one-second readings is over 5 minutes.\nThe Australian Bureau began the change-over to electronic probes as the primary instrument for the measurement of air temperatures in November 1996. The original IT system for averaging the one-second readings from the electronic probes was put in place by Almos Pty Ltd, who had done similar work for the Indian, Kuwaiti, Swiss and other meteorological offices. The software in the Almos setup (running on the computer within the on-site shelter) computed the one-minute average (together with other statistics).\nThis data was then sent to what was known as a MetConsole (the computer server software), which then displayed the data, and further processed the data into \u2018Synop\u2019, \u2018Metar\u2019, \u2018Climat\u2019formats. This system was compliant with World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. The maximum daily temperature for each location was recorded as the highest one-minute average for that day. This was the situation until at least 2011.\nI have this on good advice from a previous Bureau employee.\nIt is likely to have been the situation through until perhaps February 2013 when Sue Barrell from the Bureau wrote to a colleague of mine, Peter Cornish, explaining that the one-second readings from the automatic weather station at SydneyBotanical Gardens were numerically-averaged. At some point over the last five years, however,this system has been disbanded. All, or most, of the automatic weather stations now stream data from the electronic probes directly to the Bureau\u2019s own software. This could be an acceptable situation, except that theBureau no-longer averages the one-second readings over a one-minute period.\nIndeed, it could be concluded that the current system is likely to generate new record hot days for the same weather, because of the increased sensitivity of the measuring equipment and the absence of any averaging/smoothing. To be clear, the highest one-second spot reading is now recorded as the maximum temperature for that day at the 563 automatic weather stations across Australia that are measuring surface air temperatures.\nJust yesterday, the Bureau fed that \u201chottest ever\u201d meme with a claim that analysis of data from about 700 weather stations across the country showed Wednesday was the hottest day recorded in Australia, with the nationally averaged maximum daytime temperature reaching 41.9C.\nThat was apparently a full degree higher than the previous record of 40.9C set on Tuesday, which itself broke the mark of 40.3C from January 2013.\nBut how exactly are the temperatures being measured, and which stations are being combined?\nThe Bureau has deleted the hottest day ever recorded with a mercury thermometer in a Stevenson screen, which was 51.6 degrees Celsius at Bourke in 1909.\nThen there is the issue of the Bureau cooling the past.\nFor example, it is a full 1.4 degrees cooler in Darwin on 1st January 1910 in the official ACORN-SAT version 2, temperature data base, relative to the actual temperature recorded back then in a Stevenson Screen with a mercury thermometer.\nI have also documented how the Bureau put a limit on how cold a temperature can be recorded.\nNot to mention closing stations in high altitude regions that may record colder temperatures. So the 700 weather stations used to calculate the hottest day on Wednesday may be skewered warmer since the closure of stations in the coldest places:\nDuring June and July 2017, blizzard conditions were experienced across the Australian Alps, but we will never know how cold it actually got. Because a MSI1 card reader prevented the equipment \u2013 able to record down to minus 60 \u2013 from recording below minus 10 at Thredbo and probably also at many other locations.\nIt is also impossible to know how cold this last winter was relative to 1994 because the weather station at Charlotte Pass was closed in March 2015 \u2013 it is no longer in operation.\nI\u2019ve written to the National Audit Office about only some of these issues and that was some years ago now.", "label": 1}, "text-284": {"text": "Yang Hengjun: Australian writer subjected to 'absurd' interrogation in China as health\u00a0deteriorates\nDetained Australian writer Dr Yang Hengjun has insisted he is innocent of the espionage allegations made against him and told Chinese authorities he has never been a spy for any government. But his isolated incarceration in Beijing \u2013 potentially facing the death penalty \u2013 remains indeterminate.\nYang, a former diplomat turned globally influential blogger and advocate for democracy, was arrested when he arrived in China on 18 January this year. He is being detained by the Ministry of State Security, charged with one count of espionage. There is no indication when, if at all, he will face court.\nAn Australian citizen, he has not been allowed access to his lawyers or to see family members.\nYang has not been given any letters written to him by family, nor allowed to write to them. He has been shown photographs of his family, but was not allowed to keep them.\nHowever, his interrogations have been reduced to once a month, and he no longer has his hands and feet shackled in irons during questioning.\nSources have confirmed to the Guardian that Yang\u2019s only interrogation this month began at midnight, and lasted for two-and-a-half hours. Yang was not restrained for this interrogation but reported the lines of questioning were often unrelated to the allegations against him, and, in some cases, \u201cabsurd\u201d.\nSources have also confirmed Yang\u2019s health has deteriorated over the past month. He suffers from high blood pressure and several other serious health conditions which are being monitored and medicated but have worsened significantly in detention. He is allowed to shower once a week, and has access to a small enclosure outside his cell \u2013 with access to fresh air and natural light \u2013 for one hour, twice a day.\nIn detention, Yang has continued to maintain his innocence but has said he suspects someone in the investigation team is trying to frame him for espionage and is seeking to incriminate him.\nHe has told interrogators he has never been a spy for any government or any organisation.\nChinese-born Yang has said he was an \u201cordinary public servant\u201d for the Chinese government, serving in the ministry of foreign affairs for a decade until 1997, when he moved to the US to work as an independent researcher. Since then, he has not been involved with any government anywhere in the world.\nYang said he believed in the rule of law in China, although he was losing confidence in this. He said he has felt threatened at times, but did not elaborate on the nature of these threats.\nThe Guardian understands none of Yang, his legal team, or the Australian embassy have been told the specific charges against him, or presented with any evidence of his alleged offending.\nThe Criminal Law of the PRC details punishment for espionage and endangering national security.\nCollusion with foreign states to harm China\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty or security attracts a prison term of at least 10 years.\n\u201cState organ personnel\u201d, such as diplomats, who defect and endanger national security can be jailed for between five and 10 years.\nBut crimes that endanger national security, that have caused \u201cparticularly serious harm to the country and the people\u201d, and where \u201cthe circumstances are particularly vile\u201d, can attract the death penalty.\nYang was formerly a diplomat for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, before working in the private sector in Hong Kong and moving to Australia, then to the USA. A writer of spy novels, he has been a popular blogger, political commentator and agitator for democratic reforms in China for more than a decade.\nHe was known online as a \u201cdemocracy-peddler\u201d, and regarded around the world as an authoritative and influential political commentator on China.\nYang, who became an Australian citizen in 2002, had been living in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University, before flying to Guangzhou with his family in January. His wife and child were able to enter China, but authorities escorted Yang from the plane into detention.\nHe was initially held under a system known as \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a type of secret detention of up to six months in which authorities can deny a suspect access to lawyers and to family, and restrict external communication. In July, Yang was moved to a Beijing detention centre in the lead-up to being charged.\nHe is allowed one half-hour consular visit a month.\nThe Guardian understands Yang\u2019s case remains in the investigation period, which could last until March of next year.\nThe Australian government has repeatedly pressed China that Yang be treated in accordance with international human rights law, \u201cwith special attention to those provisions that prohibit torture and inhumane treatment, guard against arbitrary detention and that protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\u201d.\nIn a speech this week, the Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said: \u201cI will continue to advocate strongly for fair and transparent treatment\u201d for Yang.\nYang\u2019s former doctoral supervisor in Australia, Dr Feng Chongyi, said there appeared to be no evidence Yang has ever been engaged in espionage, and that the charges against him were politically motivated.\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the speech by the foreign minister. I still hope that the Chinese authorities make the commonsense decision and release Yang because there is no evidence to support any sensible charge against him.\u201d\nFeng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology, Sydney, told the Guardian: \u201cHe\u2019s no longer shackled, and the number of interrogations has reduced, I would say this is due to international attention, including pressure from the Australian government\u201d.\nIn August, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, said Yang\u2019s arrest had been handled in accordance with Chinese law and that the Australian citizen was in good health.\nGeng also warned Australia against \u201cinterference\u201d in the case.\n\u201cChina deplores the Australian statement on this case \u2026 the Australian side should earnestly respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty and must not ... interfere with a Chinese case,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "text-285": {"text": "Countries put their own economic growth first.\nDespite President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to push climate change to the front of the discussion during the recently concluded G-7 meeting in France, the confab ended without a concrete agreement to take action on the issue.\nSome of the blame was laid at the feet of President Donald Trump, who was \u201ca no-show at a crucial session on climate change\u201d today. While blaming Trump for the lack of progress on climate change might make for a good headline, the broader story is more complex. Indeed, a look at the numbers shows that the U.S. has slashed its coal use and cut its total greenhouse emissions more than any country in the G-7. It has also become a major supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) \u2014 which emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal during combustion \u2014 to other members of the G-7.\nBefore turning to those issues, it must be noted that international efforts to achieve major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have largely failed. While it\u2019s true that more than 170 countries signed on to the Paris Agreement, that accord\u2019s CO2 targets are not legally enforceable. (Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2017.)\nWhy, despite the urgency of dealing with climate change, aren\u2019t more countries making big cuts to their emissions? The most succinct explanation can be had by understanding what Roger Pielke Jr. has dubbed the Iron Law of Climate Policy: \u201cWhen policies on emissions reductions collide with policies focused on economic growth, economic growth will win out every time.\u201d\nFew countries prove that better than India. On Monday, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was a guest at the G-7 session on climate. While Modi talked up India\u2019s efforts to use more solar energy, the reality is that his country remains heavily reliant on coal and will continue relying on it for decades to come. According to the BP Statistical Review, India\u2019s coal consumption jumped by 74 percent over the past decade. India is now the world\u2019s second-largest coal consumer, and according to a March report by the Brookings Institution, some 50,000 megawatts of new coal-fired electric generation capacity is currently under construction in the country.\nTo be sure, the growth in global coal consumption is slowing. But for developing countries, particularly in southern Asia, coal remains an essential fuel. Over the past decade, six countries \u2014 Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and India \u2014 have all seen dramatic increases in coal consumption. Those countries are home to some 2 billion people. As coal consumption in those countries has grown, so too have incomes. For instance, between 2008 and 2018, Vietnam\u2019s coal use tripled and per capita GDP more than doubled.\nAlthough the G-7 members say they want to slash their emissions, several members remain heavily reliant on coal. In the wake of the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Japan closed almost all of its nuclear plants. That, in turn, has forced it to rely more heavily on coal. Between 2016 and 2018, Japan opened eight new coal-fired generation plants, and the country has plans to build about 30 more coal plants with a total capacity of about 17,000 megawatts.\nA similar situation is playing out in Germany. After Fukushima, the country\u2019s environmental groups persuaded the government to shutter Germany\u2019s nuclear reactors. That, in turn, has forced Germany to rely more heavily on coal. In 2017, the country\u2019s lignite-fired power plants had the same share in Germany\u2019s electricity mix as they\u2019d had in 2000. Germany\u2019s continuing reliance on coal has meant that the country \u2014 which has the largest economy in Europe \u2014 has not come close to achieving the emissions cuts targeted under the Energiewende, the name for the country\u2019s plan to overhaul its energy and power systems.\nNow let\u2019s look at the U.S., which has cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by a total of 600 million tons since 2008. For comparison, Germany has cut its emissions by about 100 million tons and the United Kingdom has cut its emissions by 169 million tons. To be clear, per capita emissions in the U.S. are far higher than they are in Germany and the U.K.; Americans drive more and live in bigger houses than their European counterparts. Nevertheless, the drop in overall U.S. emissions is nearly as large as what was achieved in all of Europe over the past decade (756 million tons).\nFurthermore, the reductions in U.S. emissions were largely due not to government mandates but to the shale revolution. Over the past decade, thanks to hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, domestic natural-gas production has nearly doubled. The surge in production has encouraged U.S. electricity producers to shutter coal plants and replace them with ones fueled by natural gas. The result is that in 2018, U.S. coal consumption was at its lowest level since the 1970s. It appears that domestic coal consumption will continue falling over the next few years as lower-cost gas continues to displace coal.\nThe other dynamic at play at the G-7 is that the U.S. has become a major supplier of liquefied natural gas to dozens of countries around the world. According to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, Japan is now the third-largest buyer of U.S. LNG. The U.K., France, and Italy are among more than 30 countries that have purchased LNG cargoes from U.S. suppliers this year. Further, as the U.S. has boosted its LNG exports, the global price for LNG has fallen, making the fuel more competitive against coal in Asia. The result is that American natural gas is helping Japan reduce the amount of coal it burns for electricity production, which is helping cut Japan\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions. Increasing the use of natural gas around the world, along with more deployment of nuclear energy, should be a key strategy in rich and poor countries alike to help reduce emissions and improve living standards.\nOver the weekend, Jean Jouzel, a French climate expert, was quoted in an article the New York Times ran about the G-7 meeting and climate change. Jouzel declared that the \u201cinternational scene now lacks dynamism in the fight against global warming.\u201d He continued, saying that \u201cto effectively combat global warming, all countries must look in the same direction.\u201d\nTherein lies the rub: When it comes to economic growth and energy consumption, the members of the G-7, as well as other countries around the world, aren\u2019t looking in the same direction. Instead, per the Iron Law of Climate Policy, they are looking out for their own economic growth. And there\u2019s little reason to expect that that will change any time soon.", "label": 1}, "text-286": {"text": "Health retreat run by banned wellness coach Barbara O'Neill under investigation\nAustralia\u2019s charities watchdog is investigating the activities of an exclusive health retreat run by the disgraced wellness coach Barbara O\u2019Neill, who has been banned from practising for life after giving potentially fatal health advice to vulnerable clients.\nEarlier in October the Health Care Complaints Commission found O\u2019Neill told people the debunked theory that their cancer was a fungus that could be cured with bicarbonate soda rather than through conventional medical treatment, and gave misleading and dangerous pregnancy and child-rearing advice through her seminars, website, online lectures and consultations with clients.\nThe commission\u2019s investigation found O\u2019Neill never held any membership with any accredited professional health organisation and had failed to obtain any relevant health-related degrees or diplomas.\nShe has been permanently barred from providing any health services either voluntarily or in a paid capacity, including giving lectures.\nBut the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission [Acnc] has received numerous complaints about the Misty Mountain Health Retreat charity affiliated with O\u2019Neill and which her husband, Michael O\u2019Neill, chairs.\nAs an Acnc-registered health promotion charity, Misty Mountain Health Retreat receives government grants and various tax concessions. Its most recent financial report states that the charity operates live-in health centres in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people with chronic and terminal illnesses receive diet, exercise and health advice. Michael O\u2019Neill was the founder and Senate candidate for the Involuntary Medication Objectors (Vaccination/Fluoride) party in the May 2019 federal election. The party is anti-vaccination and is sceptical of conventional, evidence-based medicine.\nA complaint made to Acnc investigators and seen by Guardian Australia alleges the Misty Mountain Health Retreat\u2019s activities are outside the legal requirements for a health promotion charity, given it \u201coperates what is effectively a wellness holiday resort\u201d.\n\u201cMisty Mountain Health Retreat\u2019s unqualified staff give its clients erroneous advice,\u201d the complaint, made by the dietician and nutritionist Mandy-Lee Noble, alleges. \u201cThe clients are at risk if they act on it.\u201d\nThe Acnc website states the legal meaning of \u2018health promotion charity\u2019 is a charitable institution whose principal activity is to promote the prevention or the control of diseases in humans. As examples of activities that align with this definition, the Acnc lists raising public awareness of a disease, undertaking medical research, developing or providing aids or equipment, and providing clients and carers with evidence-based health education. The Misty Mountain Health Retreat does not appear to engage in any of those activities.\nThe Health Care Complaints Commission investigation into Barbara O\u2019Neill found health lectures given by her, which are promoted by the Misty Mountain Health Retreat, include recommendations not to vaccinate, to use alternative therapies in the place of conventional treatments for cancer and to follow alternative feeding guidelines for infants that are known to be harmful and potentially fatal.\nNoble\u2019s complaint alleges that Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s involvement with an anti-vaccination political party was a conflict of interest with health promotion. An Acnc spokesman said: \u201cThe Acnc takes all concerns seriously and will investigate if there is evidence that a charity has failed to comply with its obligations.\u201d\nThe charity has held various names since its registration in 2012 including the Misty Mountain Aboriginal Healing Place and the Misty Mountain Health and Education Institute. Australian Securities and Investments Commission documents show that in 2017 Michael O\u2019Neill changed the name from Misty Mountain Health and Education Institute to the Misty Mountain Health Retreat because the charity \u201coffers welfare services rather than education services\u201d and therefore should apply to the Australian Taxation Office and Acnc for status as a public benevolent institution, a subtype of charity that can register as deductible gift recipients.\nGuardian Australia sent O\u2019Neill a list of questions asking about the welfare services provided by the retreat, and how vulnerable clients including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients paid for these services, with prices ranging from $2,450 for a one-week stay for one person to $8,800 for a two-week stay for two people. Clients can pay for additional treatments including an $85 facial or $100 per hour colonic irrigation.\nO\u2019Neill did not respond to the questions, and instead sent a screenshot of a letter from an Aboriginal woman, who Guardian Australia has not named, from Port Macquarie who said she did casual work at the retreat. \u201cMichael O\u2019Neill has shown me your email questions where you are trying to put Misty Mountain Health Retreat in a bad light,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are many in our community that owe there [sic] improved health to Misty and Barbara [O\u2019Neill]. Don\u2019t use our people to do your dirty work.\u201d\nThe charity\u2019s expenses listed in financial documents include a Hyundai excavator loan of $23,830 and an Isuzu truck loan for $28,472. At one point, the charity also offered clients helicopter rides. The O\u2019Neills did not respond to questions on how these purchases were used by the charity. Its 2018 financial report states profits dropped from $120,278 in 2017 to $5,045 in 2018, and that the charity received $400 in government grants. Their annual statements for 2014-2017 list government grants totalling $6,440.\nA spokesman for the Health Care Complaints Commission said the activities of Barbara O\u2019Neill were being monitored closely. \u201cPresenting health education in any form or delivering health services, would be a breach of her prohibition order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prohibition order applies in NSW, Vic, Qld and SA. In general, if the material is accessible in [those jurisdictions] online, then it is considered to be delivering a health service.\u201d\nBarbara O\u2019Neill issued a statement published by an online petition that has been launched in support of her work. \u201cThank you all for the wonderful love and support that you have given through this challenging time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks a bit dark now, but the Great God of the Universe will not let His wonderful health truth to be eliminated, regardless of how men and women may try.\u201d\nLater in October she will deliver a wellness program at the Living Springs Retreat in the US, with the retreat promoting her as \u201ca qualified naturopath, nutritionist, lecturer, and author\u201d.

Some argued that we shouldn\u2019t mess with over 150 years of tradition, seemingly forgetting that before the AFL was the AFL, it was the VFL, and before that, the VFA. Others argued \u2013 without further elucidation \u2013 that this was yet another case of \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d. A tired slogan all too often advanced without any attempt to explain it, the argument is supposed to be self-evident. Are we being told that any attempt to question the words we use and the meanings they make is an illness of mind, a kind of \u201csickness\u201d, a pathology? \nOther critics noted that the men\u2019s competition is the \u201cnorm\u201d, meaning that there is no need to distinguish it from the women\u2019s. To do so would be an insult to the men\u2019s game, since we already know that \u201cAFL\u201d is synonymous with men. Proponents of the \u201cM\u201d are of course well aware of its normative status. This is precisely the problem they want us to reflect on.\nLet me explain why so many footy fans have chosen this as their issue and why we are having this debate.\nFirst and foremost \u2013 as the debate itself reminds us \u2013 language matters. Language does not simply reflect society but shapes it. These issues have been the subject of academic analysis by experts in semiotics and linguistics for decades.\nLanguage reflects and reinforces meanings, shapes systems of thought and social norms, including the things we come to value and devalue. Our values and norms are shaped by the repetition of these words and the relations between them. \nThere are other ways that language has shaped and constrained how we come to think of women and it has long been dominated by words that position men as the default or norm. Words such as \u201cmankind\u201d and \u201cmanmade\u201d are used to denote humanity as a whole. They reinforce the notion that this is a world by, for and of men. Many of us who sit outside these norms feel our absence acutely, and frequently, in ways that those who occupy the dominant status may never notice, be aware of, or appreciate. To us, it matters.\nLaws and other canonical documents often referenced only men, raising questions about whether women (and others, such as non-white men) existed in the eyes of the law at all. In some cases, the absence of references to women meant that they had no rights in law, and could not benefit from them. For those others, language really mattered, in a very real and tangible way.\nThese tendencies in language \u2013 to privilege men and erase or omit women \u2013 are pervasive, widespread, and continue to linger today. And one need not be excluded from legal rights to care about these omissions and erasures or to feel that our lives might be made just a bit better if our language was more deliberately inclusive.\nThe debate over AFLM cannot be separated from these histories and the injustices that language helps to perpetuate. It matters that the sport\u2019s governing body (the \u201cAFL\u201d) is wholly synonymous with the men\u2019s competition (the \u201cAFL\u201d) so that the men\u2019s competition remains the default, or norm.\nWhat message does this send to women, men, boys and girls about the value placed on both women and women\u2019s sport? It signals that we are lesser. This is repeated in every other aspect of the sport\u2019s governance: from inequalities in pay and resourcing, the shortened season, the difficult conditions under which many athletes compete, and the long fight to even get a women\u2019s competition in the first place.\nThe subordinate status of AFLW is produced not just by historic inequities, differences in resourcing and pay inequities but by the continued positioning of women\u2019s sport as an afterthought: a symbolic and literal \u201cother\u201d to the men\u2019s. If this week\u2019s debate is anything to go by, many people think this is \u2018just a fact\u2019 and prefer it to stay this way. But that is a backward-looking view; one which clings to old linguistic and structural patterns. It is a view that must change if the game is to grow, and if gender equality \u2013 in sport and society \u2013 is to ever become a reality.\nWhen leading sports commentators dismiss the \u201cM\u201d debate as silly and meaningless, then, they demonstrate an ignorance of language\u2019s constitutive power, the historic privileging of men as the norm and the force and significance of linguistic repetition.\nIt would be a small gesture to add an \u201cM\u201d. It won\u2019t fix everything, but I\u2019m not sure that anyone is claiming it will. For many of us, it would be a profound and meaningful step. One that will harm no-one, but mean a great deal to those of us so often on the outside. This includes future generations of girls, who do not yet know they are the \u201cother\u201d.

She also said there was no issue as a result of her being a city of Sydney councillor.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission on Monday declared Phelps the winner with a margin of 1,851 votes or 1.2% in two-party-preferred terms after a record 19% swing against the Coalition.\nAlthough Phelps has hosed down the suggestion she could vote for a no-confidence motion by declaring she has \u201cno intention of being a wrecker\u201d, her entry to parliament spells trouble for the Morrison government, which has now lost its majority.\nPhelps said a no-confidence motion was currently a hypothetical but if one arose she would consider all the evidence before deciding her position.\n\u201cOne of the things I will bring to the parliament is the ability to make a careful diagnosis and to have a plan, after looking at all the evidence to hand,\u201d she said.\nScott Morrison will seek to shore up the government\u2019s position with a bus tour of Queensland, in a bid to visit key marginals before the 2019 federal election.\nOn Monday Phelps said her election was propelled by \u201cdisenchantment with the party political system\u201d after the ouster of Malcolm Turnbull from the Liberal leadership, and discontent over the lack of action on climate change and treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.\nCommon ground between the crossbench and opposition on establishing a federal anti-corruption commission and ending live sheep exports exposes the government on the floor of the lower house.\nDutton, the home affairs minister, and Crewther also face the possibility of a hostile referral to the high court to determine if their business interests constitute an indirect pecuniary interest in an agreement with the commonwealth, which would disqualify them from parliament.\nLabor has indicated it will push to refer Crewther. It was revealed on Friday he invested $25,000 in Gretals Australia, a biotechnology company that has received commonwealth grants and funding.\nMorrison has said he has \u201cno concerns\u201d about the investment, which was declared on the parliamentary register of interests.\nAsked how she would approach referrals to the high court, Phelps told Radio National that \u201cevidence is the most important thing\u201d in deciding whether to ask the court to rule on an MP\u2019s eligibility under section 44 of the constitution.\n\u201cI would have to get a comprehensive briefing on those two cases and will make a decision based on that briefing,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be seeking that as soon as I possibly can \u2026 I will be asking for information to make an informed decision.\u201d\nDutton has had a question mark over his eligibility since August, when it was revealed he is a beneficiary of a trust that operates childcare centres that receive federal subsidies.

The word itself has been considered by the Inuit to be pejorative. Its etymology is uncertain: \u201cEskimo\u201d could mean either \u201ceater of raw flesh\u201d or \u201che laces snowshoes\u201d in Cree, the language of a First Nations people.\nIn either case, some Inuit and outside supporters had waged a five-year public campaign to get the nickname replaced, much like some Americans want Washington\u2019s NFL franchise to abandon the \u201cRedskins\u201d nickname. The Cleveland Indians dropped their \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d logo in 2018. Many colleges have replaced Native American nicknames. But \u201cEskimos\u201d will stay. Why?\nThe team has had an \u201cEE\u201d helmet logo for years, and its website is simply www.esks.com. Substitutes like \u201cElk,\u201d an animal that has proliferated in Alberta, have been suggested. But the team said that it would keep the Eskimos after \u201can extensive year-long formal research and engagement program with Inuit leaders and community members across Canada.\u201d\nThe team said there\u2019d been no consensus among Inuit to change the name. The team did say it would increase its involvement in Canada\u2019s north with a plan that includes visits to schools, youth groups and festivals. Edmonton also says the team has been \u201cwarmly welcomed\u201d by the Inuit.\nStill, the team\u2019s decision was met with some disappointment and skepticism. Natan Obed, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the organization that represents the 65,000 Inuit in Canada, had called for a nickname change in 2015 but declined further comment when contacted by the Guardian recently, referring to what he\u2019d said in the past. \u201cThis issue is about our right to self-determine who we are on our own terms. We are not mascots or emblems,\u201d Obed wrote in 2015.\nOthers with an interest in the issue were not surprised that the team kept its name. Although several Canadian newspapers have editorialized that a nickname change is needed \u2013 and even inevitable \u2013 critics of the name seemed resigned to its continued usage.\n\u201cI believe this is their understanding of compromise and a show of interest in the people whose name that they continue to use is slanderous, outdated and unnecessary. On the one hand they are saying, \u2018Yep, we\u2019re gonna keep using Eskimos, but hey, look over here, we\u2019ll bring some Inuit kids to the south for a game!\u2019\u201d Norma Dunning, an Inuit writer and scholar with a PhD in Indigenous People\u2019s Education, tells the Guardian.\nThe nickname dates to 1949, when the team first joined the Western Interprovincial Football Union, one of the ancestors of the CFL. The nickname was first used as \u201cEsquimaux\u201d in 1892 by sports writers as a derisive way to describe a rugby team from Edmonton that was to play a rival team from Calgary.\nThe name stuck, even though Edmonton has only 1,100 Inuit and is hundreds of miles south of the Arctic Circle. Over the years there have been Edmonton Eskimos football, hockey and baseball teams.\n\u201cOver this past year with the \u2018research\u2019 \u2013 and I put that word into quotes, because the team refuses to release their data to the public and are falling back on the Freedom of Information and Personal Privacy Act \u2013 that the team has brought into media, they gave the appearance of inviting the Inuit perspective on things,\u201d Dunning says.\n\u201cHowever, the bottom line is this: The Edmonton Eskimos is a large corporation. Their logo and team merchandise has value, not just monetarily but through recognition of the \u2018EE\u2019 insignia. The Edmonton Eskimos are also a top-rated team. One of the common comebacks that I would receive when I spoke in favor of a team name change were the many fans who were outraged at having to rebuy all the merchandise they have collected over many decades of time. The bottom line may very well be the cost, the financial loss that would occur with a name change and a possible loss of loyal fans. Money always talks.\u201d\nTo be sure, the Inuit have larger concerns than the nickname of a football team \u2013 oil and gas extraction from their lands being just one long-standing issue. It could be that sports fans have come to think of \u201cEskimos\u201d as merely an old team name, not a representation of the Inuit.\n\u201cI think there it is fair to assume that the team and its management may rely on the fact that people still do not understand the history of the term and its meaning, and how it has been used to dehumanize Inuit,\u201d says Jennifer Adese, an associate professor in the department of sociology at the University of Toronto Mississauga.\nAllen Watt, the Eskimos\u2019 director of marketing, referred the Guardian to a recent story in the Nunatsiaq News in which Lorne Kusugak, a member of the legislative assembly of Nunavut, was quoted as telling the legislature: \u201cEverybody else who thinks it is offensive, settle down, take a Valium, and don\u2019t be so sensitive.\u201d Reader comments at the end of the story were mixed, but emotional.\nRick Harp, the founder of the Indigena Media Group and the host of a podcast that has tackled Inuit issues, tells the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s decades of investment in the name. I, of course, have no way of knowing for sure, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the franchise felt that the costs of inertia would be minimal in comparison to the alternatives. In other words, [the Eskimos were] calculating that more people would be pissed at a name change than would be pleased.\u201d\nUnlike Washington\u2019s NFL team, which has the profile of a Native American on the side of its burgundy helmets, or the Chiefs, who were actually named after the mayor of Kansas City in 1963 but whose fans use a \u201cTomahawk Chop\u201d as a chant, the Eskimos don\u2019t use Inuit imagery, although Harp points out that caricatures have been used in the past. \nOne of the team\u2019s mascots is called Nanook \u2013 evocative of Nanook of the North, the famous 1922 documentary about an Inuk and his family \u2013 but this Nanook looks like a polar bear. Merchandise at the team\u2019s online store carry either \u201cEskimos\u201d or the EE logo. And the nickname is not going away.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worth noting that the team\u2019s management used the lack of consensus as a rationale for keeping the name, rather than acknowledging that they have learned about the term\u2019s harmful impact and moving on from it,\u201d Adese says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the lack of consensus is a legitimate reason to ignore the way in which it has been used as a derogatory and racist term.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-290": {"text": "The Guardian view on resetting relations with China: times are changing\nThe pandemic has changed our view of the world not by bringing us radical, unsuspected insights, but by confronting us with uncomfortable truths we avoided before. That Chinese authorities suppressed the extent of the outbreak and punished whistleblowers is appalling but not shocking from the country with the world\u2019s most sophisticated censorship apparatus. That they can be ruthless was equally obvious: in Xinjiang, a million or more Uighurs have been herded into detention camps, with little international protest. The difference is that this time the repercussions have been felt outside its borders.\nIt has accelerated the clear shift towards a more hostile view of China across the political spectrum, albeit fuelled in the US by outright hawks in the Trump administration. Hopes that China might one day pursue political reform have been erased by its increasing repression at home and hardball tactics abroad. Countries worldwide have been taking heed. The UK had already moved away from the \u201cgolden relationship\u201d that David Cameron and George Osborne pursued with apparent indifference to the cost. Now senior Conservatives want a fundamental reset, while UK spy agencies are, more cautiously, calling for a reassessment.\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, warned this month that after coronavirus there can be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with China. The outbreak has shown how serious and widespread the ramifications of suppressing information can be. On the economic front, the scramble to obtain personal protective equipment has underlined the recklessness of a dependence on any one country for manufacturing.\nBeijing\u2019s successful attempts to change the narrative, to dilute domestic anger, have caused fury. Diplomats and state media have touted conspiracies suggesting that the US could be responsible for the virus. US intelligence agencies and an EU report say Chinese operatives spread disinformation about Covid-19 on social media (Beijing denies it). State media\u2019s highlighting of imported cases (almost all of which have been Chinese nationals returning home) have fuelled xenophobia: Africans in Guangzhou have been targeted for tests, harassed, barred from shops and restaurants, and even evicted.\nBeijing has also seized the opportunity to crush opposition in Hong Kong while the world\u2019s attention is elsewhere. Police arrested 15 veteran activists including Martin Lee, the region\u2019s \u201cfather of democracy\u201d, hours after China\u2019s liaison office declared it was not bound by a clause in the city\u2019s mini-constitution which bars Beijing from interfering in local affairs. The liaison office\u2019s chief has called for the urgent passing of a highly controversial national security law.\nBritain has a particular duty to speak out over Hong Kong; but many countries are reassessing relations. The bigger question is not how we see Beijing, but whether we are willing to reappraise ourselves. China\u2019s worst behaviour has been encouraged by the greed, complacency, division and short-termism of others.\nBut there is a distinction between holding China to account, and using that to distract from other governments\u2019 failings. There is also a world of difference between reconsidering the role of Chinese companies in essential infrastructure, such as 5G, and absurd calls for pandemic compensation, or \u2013 in the US \u2013 to ban all Chinese students from science and technology degrees. The virus has shown how much our futures are linked; things would be far worse had China suppressed all news of the outbreak for months, as it did with Sars, instead of telling the World Health Organization quickly.

The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper\u2019s expose that prompted the business select committee\u2019s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate?\nYes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,\u201d he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective.\nPerhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct\u2019s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes\u2019 notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator\u2019s report.\nAt that point, some of Hellawell\u2019s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man.\nHellawell\u2019s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders\u2019 tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a \u00a35m fee to Ashley\u2019s future son-in-law, its new \u201chead of elevation\u201d, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser.\nSome investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell\u2019s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley\u2019s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%.\nNobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed.\nSir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, \u201cbut steer clear of the banks\u201d. It is sound advice.\nRBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of \u00a310bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose?\nThere is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won\u2019t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending \u2013 the deeper problem \u2013 would be made worse. Macpherson\u2019s prediction of a \u201ccorrosive\u201d process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money.\nLabour, if it\u2019s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks.

And while Donald Trump did the right thing by walking out of the Paris Agreement, Mr Modi unthinkingly remains committed to it and Niti Ayog has been touting subsidised electric vehicles.\nOur party disagrees with this approach. First, because we oppose subsidies for any industry. But second, because we believe there is a strong case to impose Pigovian taxes on solar energy given the economic and environmental harm it causes.\nSolar energy can do a few useful things. It can power a radio in an off-grid location.

Even after a taxpayer subsidy of $3,888 it cost me $10,730. And after a year\u2019s use it has generated far less electricity than I was promised, so instead of a 6-year payback period it will now take 11 years \u2013 but only if I never spend any money to maintain it, the inverter never goes bad, the system somehow lasts 11 years and feed-in tariffs don\u2019t reduce.

It would require 1,000 years of production to make enough batteries for two days\u2019 worth of U.S. electricity demand\u201d.\nThe idea of mass adoption of electric vehicles is a hallucination. EV batteries can hardly store any energy and need vast amounts of time to re-charge. And time is never free. These vehicles are not fit for purpose.\nBut don\u2019t we get huge environmental benefits from solar? Not at all. Instead, solar energy is one of the worst enemies of the environment, even excluding the massive loss of natural habitat. Solar waste is extremely toxic. Michael Shellenberger has found that \u201csolar panels create 300 times more toxic waste per unit of energy than nuclear power plants\u201d.\n<|endoftext>|\nReport: Green Energy Incentives are Failing to Keep the Lights On\nAn Australian Government AEMO commissioned industry report has suggested that while government incentives make renewables preferable to coal, the new renewable capacity isn\u2019t helping grid stability.\nMany Australians hailed the recent electoral victory of the Conservative Morrison government as a victory over the wild green socialism of their political opponents, but I see the Morrison win as a very qualified victory for affordable energy.\nDespite years of Conservative dominance of Australian federal politics, a deluge of cash is still flowing into the pockets of green energy rent seekers.\nGreen energy optimists tout an expensive Morrison government scheme to massively increase hydro capacity as the solution to renewable intermittency. But hydroelectricity in a dry country like Australia is not entirely reliable; the catchment where the grand new hydro scheme will be based suffered a severe drought in recent years, which placed substantial pressure on water users.\nSqueezed between these expensive new hydro schemes and calls for new renewable energy incentives are Aussie businesses and voters, who are becoming increasingly impatient with watching \u201caverage prices across the curve keep creeping up\u201d.\n<|endoftext>|\nMassive East Coast solar project generates fury from neighbors\nMichael O\u2019Bier has lived here on a hidden piece of land nestled against thousands of acres of trees in rural Virginia for 32 years.\nNow, the trees are gone and the 62-year-old O\u2019Bier says he\u2019s packing belongings into cargo trailers. That\u2019s because the site of the largest proposed solar energy project on the East Coast could end up only 62 feet away from the side of his two-story home.\n\u201cI would have to leave,\u201d O\u2019Bier told Fox News on a drizzly afternoon this week, looking out over a field of already-cleared trees adjacent to his property. \u201cI can\u2019t live here.\u201d\nThe company's Power wants to build a 500-Megawatt solar project on the 6,350-acre site in western Spotsylvania County, with 3,500 acres being used to house 1.8 million solar panels. The land, currently owned by seven different landowners who plan to sell it to the company, has already been cleared for timber in anticipation of the project. sPower has said the project \u201cwill be safe, reliable, quiet and screened from public view.\u201d\nBut a vocal contingent of activist-residents are working to pressure county officials to deny special use permits for sPower, arguing it would have disastrous environmental, economic and cultural impacts on the area.

During a driving tour of the area, Sean Fogarty, a 63-year-old retiree with a background in engineering, pointed to a lot purchased by a couple who planned to build a lakeside home not far from the site.

During a conversation in July with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he asked for help in the investigation of his likely opponent in 2020, Joe Biden, whose son had business dealings in the country. On Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi announced that impeachment proceedings would finally begin.\nBut the release of the conversation summary or \u201cmemcon\u201d between Trump and Zelenskiy on Wednesday left things a little hazier than expected.\nTrump did ask for a favour, but it was for help in his obsessive quest to prove that he won the presidency fair and square. And while he later raised the prospect of an investigation into Biden, at no time did he dangle military contracts he had put on hold as an inducement. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy was more interested in possible future deals. There was a request from Trump for a quo \u2013 but no quid, exactly.\nIf the summary is accurate, what we are left with is not savoury, but neither is it definitive. It has nonetheless set in train another burst of excited commentary. What this excitement really represents is a further round in the dramatic cycle of argument about the meaning of Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral victory.\nFor liberal and conservative centrists, inured to taking turns in power for decades, Trump\u2019s rise in the Republican party and his success in beating Hillary Clinton within the appalling rules of the American game was the real affront. Blindsided by their ejection by an incoherent nonentity and sexual predator, this coalition of long-governing elites, from liberal technocrats to \u201cnever-Trump\u201d conservatives, has declared war on the president, embracing any bad pretext or good reason to call for his early ouster.\nThere are certainly many reasons to wish Trump out of office. He is incompetent and inflammatory, and his policies are racist and anti-poor. But behind the stance of permanent alarm and outrage adopted by the political establishment is a strong sense that what really irks them is that US democracy, such as it is, has toppled them from power. And after pining for so long for Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to be their redemption, they have now pinned their hopes on a \u201cmemcon ex machina\u201d.\nThe trouble from the beginning, and one reason for the constant repetition of the drama, is that Trump\u2019s very conquest of the Republican party meant it was always going to be nearly impossible to convince enough members of Congress to put this presidency down early. For every chorus of dismay and shock from never-Trump centrists there is an always-Trump faction prepared to excuse him when he comes near the line of malfeasance or crosses over it \u2013 and the chorus knows it. Both sides have deserved one another at every stage.\nFor all their appeals to enduring moral values, whether US exceptionalism or legal principle, the centrists are deploying a transparent strategy to return to power. Trump\u2019s shambolic presidency somehow seems less unsavoury than the fact that neither of these sides are able to admit how massively his election signified the failure of their policies, from endless war to economic inequality.\nLeftwing members of Congress such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders have long been in favour of impeaching Trump. But they have not made it a daily obsession. Even as Washington teemed with talking points about the phone call, Ocasio-Cortez introduced a bold plan to fight poverty; Sanders proposed a new wealth tax the day before.\nProgressives are right to worry that what matters most is not whether Trump committed an \u201cimpeachable offence\u201d (which means no more than that enough members of the House of Representatives will vote to indict him), but instead what political vision Democrats can rally behind to win the country, rigged system and all. Given the importance of that question, the current debate about whether to impeach Trump, for all the melodrama around it now, pales in comparison.\nCentrists simply want to return to the status quo interrupted by Trump, their reputations laundered by their courageous opposition to his mercurial reign, and their policies restored to credibility. Meanwhile, rightwing Republicans hope to benefit from his ascendancy, doubling down on tax cuts. No wonder progressives\u2019 greatest fear is allowing the first group to return to the failed policies that produced Trump himself, and the second to capitalise on his rise to entrench their rule indefinitely.\nAl Green, a Democratic congressman from Texas who was a lonely early proponent of impeaching Trump, commented the other day that his approach was vital precisely because it would help to win the next election. In his press conference on Wednesday, the president jeered in return. Trumpeting his own success \u2013 however unearned \u2013 in promoting economic growth, he interpreted impeachment as the strategy of a party that has nothing else to offer. \u201cAll of these people focusing on the witch-hunt because they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot,\u201d he exclaimed with some delight.\nWho is right \u2013 Green or Trump? The Ukraine affair shows that the biggest risk to the American people is that centrists link impeachment to a reinstatement of one set of failed prescriptions, while the right repulses the attempt to oust the president and rules under equally dead-end policies. And it shows that progressives must link opposition to Trump to a broader strategy to bring the country a convincing new politics of their own.\n\u2022 Samuel Moyn is a professor of law and history at Yale and the author, most recently, of Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World", "label": 0}, "text-294": {"text": "Von der Leyen pledges climate focus as MEPs back new commission\nUrsula von der Leyen has said the EU as the world\u2019s \u201ctrading superpower\u201d will lead the fight against the \u201cexistential threat\u201d from the climate crisis, and offered a waspish farewell to the Brexit party, as MEPs backed her new European commission to start work on 1 December.\nThe European parliament, sitting in Strasbourg, approved the new college of commissioners, headed by the EU executive\u2019s first female president, by 461 votes to 157 with 89 abstentions on Wednesday, giving her a larger majority than her predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker.\nVon der Leyen said the level of support she had secured, while less than that for Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso in 2004 and 2010, was a vote of confidence in what she described as an \u201cagenda for change\u201d.\nThe Green party, which has been unconvinced by the radicalism of Von der Leyen\u2019s approach, abstained in the vote and anti-EU parties including Italy\u2019s far-right League and France\u2019s National Rally rejected the proposed commission.\nThe commission, which will be formally approved by leaders on the European council on Thursday through a written procedure, is forming a month later than intended as a result of MEPs rejecting the original nominees from Hungary, France and Romania.\nVon der Leyen\u2019s hour-long speech to MEPs lacked the ad-libbing of Juncker, who was never shy of causing controversy, and offered few eye-grabbing policy initiatives.

Time for what computers can\u2019t do: empathy and creativity.\u201d\nVon der Leyen said she wanted the commission to be \u201cgeopolitical\u201d. \u201cWe can be the shapers of a better global order\u201d, she said.\nShe made a thinly veiled reference to the policies of Donald Trump in a section of the speech criticising those who sought confrontation and unilateralism.\nOf the transatlantic relationship, she said: \u201cYes, we have issues \u2013 without any doubt. But our ties have lasted the test of time. While we are speaking, thousands of students, researchers, entrepreneurs, artists continue to build zillions of friendships, business contacts and science projects.

Before now the effects of climate and environmental breakdown were mapped on to the future, but today we can see them all around us.\nAcross England and Wales, towns and villages are under floodwater; fires have raged from Australia to the Amazon; and globally we\u2019re in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, in which we stand to lose up to a million species. According to the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, tackling this crisis will require \u201cfar-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\u201d for which \u201cthe next few years are probably the most important in our history\u201d.\nUnder the Tories the pace of carbon reduction is slowing down. Emissions fell only 2.1% in 2018\nWe have the capacity, imagination and resources to radically, democratically and fairly decarbonise our economy and repair the natural world. Yet under the Tories the pace of carbon reduction is slowing down. Emissions fell by only 2.1% in 2018, less than half the average of the preceding five years. The government\u2019s own Committee on Climate Change sounded the alarm last summer, warning that: \u201cUK action to curb greenhouse gas emissions is lagging far behind what is needed, even to meet previous, less stringent, emissions targets.\u201d We must urgently change course.\nWe need a green new deal hardwired into every level of government, from Whitehall departments to local councils. For communities across the country, such a deal would mean good jobs in new green industries, more power and ownership over local decisions, cleaner air and warmer, more secure homes.\nBut a domestic programme to tackle the climate crisis will not be enough. We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem \u2013 there is no way our islands alone can escape it. Our efforts at home must be matched by those abroad \u2013 we must internationalise the green new deal.\nTo start with, we should be clear-eyed about the UK\u2019s historic contribution to this problem and our present capability to adapt to it, recognising that the poorest bear the least responsibility and the heaviest burden of climate breakdown. We also need to recognise that as we leave the EU, the climate crisis requires a new approach to international trade, finance and development.\nThe government must not use trade negotiations to bargain away our environmental protections. Instead we should encourage other countries to raise their ambitions for decarbonisation. As a centre of global finance, we should regulate private investment to make sure that money that comes through the UK isn\u2019t contributing to environmental breakdown. And rather than funding fossil fuel projects abroad, we should use our development budget and technical expertise to help other countries skip our bad habits and grow their own low-carbon economies on renewables instead \u2013 while also providing support to climate refugees.\nBut as well as all this, internationalising the green new deal requires us to build a net-zero coalition of countries, regions, cities and businesses across the world. November offers the UK a unique opportunity to lead that coalition as host of the UN climate change conference in Glasgow. Cop26 is the moment for countries to reinforce their contributions to the fight against climate change \u2013 to match warm words with concrete commitments.\nLabour lost the election, but we are still a movement that can fight for change and a better future.

One of a series of 12 murals telling the story of Bloody Sunday, the day in 1972 when the British army opened fire at a protest, shooting and mortally wounding 14 innocent civilians, it depicts the battle of the Bogside, a 1969 riot between mostly Catholic residents and police drawn almost exclusively from Protestant and unionist backgrounds.\nThis week marks 50 years since the battle, and Tom Kelly, one of the Bogside artists who painted the mural in the early 1990s, says his image shows \u201ca community standing up for basic civil and human rights\u201d. It is not intended to be partisan, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as violent or sinister.\u201d\nWhen it first went up, however, Kelly says it was heavily criticised in both the Times and the Irish Times for glorifying pre-teen violence. The Bogside murals have remained divisive ever since, not just among Protestants but among local Catholics and republicans who want to shake off the legacy of the past.\nThey have now also become something else: a tourist attraction. A recent NI Tourism report puts political murals as the eighth most visited attraction in the entire country. The neighbouring Museum of Free Derry, which tells the story of Bloody Sunday, attracted 35,000 visitors in 2018. According to the tourist board, all coach tours to the city now stop at the murals.\nEarlier this year, the local council doubled down. It took a controversial step: it would encourage this so-called \u201cTroubles tourism\u201d by providing funding to illuminate the murals at night.\nThe head of culture for the Derry and Strabane Council, Aeidin McCarter, says the illuminations are the first step in a wider project to identify murals and monuments that could contribute to Derry\u2019s tourist potential and encourage a better understanding of the city\u2019s more recent history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue the tourism industry across Northern Ireland is grappling with: how do we develop this product sensitively and ethically?\u201d McCarter says.\n\u201cMany people would love to think the content of the murals is consigned to history, and it\u2019s becoming more and more ancient history, but the reality is some of those issues are still prevalent in society,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answers to whether [the murals] support or help that move from a conflict society or whether they don\u2019t, but that\u2019s part of the discussion we have around them.\u201d\nSome critics say illuminating the murals simply keeps old wounds open. Jeanette Wark, project manager of the Cathedral youth club in the nearby Protestant enclave of Fountain, finds the Bogside murals \u201coffensive\u201d.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t amused at [the council] putting lights on them,\u201d she says, and argues that the murals only show one side of the story, omitting how Protestant families had to abandon their homes, and ignoring recent history.\nIndeed, the Troubles are far from consigned to the past. The killing in April of the journalist Lyra McKee in the nearby Creggan neighbourhood, where she was observing police raids on republican dissidents, was a reminder that Derry hasn\u2019t completely eradicated violence.\nNew murals, meanwhile, are popping up all the time, including one on the headquarters of dissident republican group Saoradh, featuring balaclava-clad gunmen and the slogan \u201cunfinished revolution\u201d. After McKee\u2019s murder, friends painted red handprints on the mural in protest against the group\u2019s links to her death. They were swiftly painted over.\nThere are also new political messages near the Bogside murals proper: recruitment posters for the Irish Republican Socialist Party, which believes a united Ireland can only be achieved through armed action; another poster glorying the Irish Republican Army terrorist group as \u201cthe people\u2019s army\u201d; and fresh graffiti expressing disillusion with Sinn Fein, the nationalist political party, for \u201cturning rebellion into money\u201d.\nTourists from around the world visit this area every day and see those murals. That\u2019s precisely why the city wants to get involved, says Odhran Dunne, head of the Visit Derry tourist board. He argues that the local community should take the lead on any Troubles tourism.\n\u201cEveryone has a different take on [the Troubles story], but that\u2019s what visitors are looking for, that authentic experience, to feel it, touch it, see it from people who\u2019ve lived it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat better way to do that than take a guide who\u2019s locally based taking you into a community who has a story to tell?\u201d\nPaul Doherty is one such community tour operator. He prefaces his visit to the Bogside murals with a personal story: his father was among those who died on Bloody Sunday. As such, he says his tour isn\u2019t the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d version of events, but inflected with his own impassioned views, as well as a counterpoint to Northern Ireland\u2019s frequent media portrayal as a country of \u201cmad people bombing and shooting each other\u201d.\nDoherty\u2019s tour ends outside the Bloody Sunday Museum, where a relative of someone killed then is always made available to tell visitors their personal story. The museum received an award for its authenticity in the 2018 NI tourism awards.\nJohn Kelly is one of them: he watched his brother\u2019s body be carried away after he was shot by British soldiers. He argues that the museum adds to the understanding of Bogside. \u201cWe find that people from Great Britain haven\u2019t got a clue, they have no idea what happened here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the time we see emotions, tears. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nTroubles tourism isn\u2019t new in Northern Ireland. It first took off in the early 2000s, says Dominic Bryan, a lecturer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \u201cPeople realised that with peace, tourism was on the agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cThe history is literally painted on the wall, in the memorials. The story of republicanism and loyalism as a narrative is being told all around you. It\u2019s very visual: it\u2019s fantastic to do a tour.\u201d\nUnlike murals painted by the IRA or paramilitary groups, the Bogside murals are not affiliated to any political group. Nevertheless, they have been politicised by becoming a \u201cfocal point for protest\u201d, says Sara McDowell, a lecturer at Ulster University.\n\u201cThese murals are not passive, they don\u2019t just exist there, they\u2019re active spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cDo they serve to educate people about the past, or do they transfer this sense of trauma and this specific narrative on to new generations?\u201d\nMcDowell said that research by one her PhD students indicates that \u201cconflict architecture\u201d, such as so-called peace walls or murals, correlates with high levels of depression in surrounding communities. \u201cBut there\u2019s very little qualitative research done on what it\u2019s like to live in these communities with these constant reminders of a very traumatic past,\u201d she says.\nCommunity-led political tourism can be problematic because \u201coften you have an individual or a small group of people who talk about the experience of all the community, when communities aren\u2019t monolithic or homogenous\u201d, McDowell says. In divided societies, community tourism can also be used by certain groups to \u201clegitimise [their] narrative and claim victimhood\u201d.\nWark, of the Cathedral youth club, says that instead of Troubles tourism led by individuals, she would like to see shared narratives of the recent history developed, and greater cross-community work.\nOne organisation doing just that is UV Arts, an award-winning social enterprise that uses street art to engage at-risk young people. The collective paints murals throughout the city in an attempt to find new ways of expressing Northern Irish identity that avoid both sectarian connotations and imagery linked to the Irish and British flags.\nOne mural in the Fountain is a multi-coloured images of bagpipers, celebrating the community\u2019s links with Scottish culture; in Bogside, a Housing Executive commission carries an environmental message; another tells the story of the Irish famine through abstract imagery that recognises suffering without being explicit. An upcoming mural will commemorate the women who worked in their husband\u2019s jobs during the Troubles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite unique here in this part of the world that people accept large-scale murals,\u201d says Donal O\u2019Doherty, one of the artists. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this tradition, saying that we love it, but we\u2019re dragging it into the future.\u201d\nKarl Porter, another artist, agrees. \u201cIn Northern Ireland there\u2019s a massive trend for figurative stuff, illustrating what happened \u2013 it\u2019s very literal,\u201d he says. \u201cWhereas we\u2019re trying to push more of a contemporary twist.\u201d\nPorter notes that the whole reason the political murals existed in the first place is that communities felt they didn\u2019t have a platform to express themselves. At the same time, he worries that celebrating the Bogside murals could entrench difference in an already deeply divided society.\n\u201cBeing surrounded by very harsh political murals the whole time, and particularly a petrol bomber \u2013 what\u2019s that going to do the development of a young person? It\u2019s subliminal messaging. Is that OK?

It\u2019s where I grew up, a place I loved as a child and came into conflict with as a teenager. Though I have a little observational distance now, the south still feels like home in a bone-deep way.\nMost writers I know wrestle with the idea of home. It\u2019s a place you love, pick fights with, want to protect. I\u2019m often frustrated by the cliched representation of the south in the media. But I\u2019m even more frustrated by the south\u2019s tepid response to climate change, and politicians who continually fail their constituents\u2019 best interests.\nI was raised in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and made it to college not having traveled above the Mason-Dixon Line. I never intended to go \u201cup there\u201d, to cold and buttoned-up New England, but after 30 years in the south, I moved with my husband to his family farm in Vermont.\nNine years later, I observe many people in the two regions still viewing each other with suspicion and anthropological wonder.\nMy northern friends and family say, \u201cI could never live \u2018down there\u2019. Those politics, and the hot summers.\u201d\nMy southern friends and family say, \u201cI could never live \u2018up there\u2019. I don\u2019t know how you survive winters.\u201d (I hardly do.)\nBut what used to seem like quaint regionalism feels like tribalism in 2018. When I watch news reports about hurricanes and politics, I see an overly simplistic and dismissive portrayal of southerners. I know that portrayal is historically hard-earned, yet unfair to the increasingly purple nature of the urban south, and the hard-working intellectuals, entrepreneurs, conservationists, social-justice workers, bookstore owners and artists that call the south home. Or even moderates alienated by the current state of political discourse, or teenagers approaching voting age who grew up more socially and environmentally progressive than their parents.\nI\u2019m no southern apologist, nor do I speak for any southerner other than myself. But I want readers to know that the south is not a uniform swath of white, populist, anti-science zealots (though they thrive there, and have the habit of being the loudest in the room).\nWhen we plan and talk about the south and climate change, it\u2019s critical to acknowledge that the region is multicultural and multitudinous.\nI want to show Guardian readers some of this texture, dig into the complexity and dissonance of the south. In this new column, I\u2019ll introduce you to shrimpers, faith leaders, real estate agents, artists and elders. You will read about conservatives, independents and liberals.\nTogether, we\u2019ll walk on the frontlines of climate change, visit flood zones, public housing, schools, coastal landmarks and places under pressure.\nSomething that keeps me awake at night: the south-east is projected to lose the most economic value in climate change scenarios, and may be the least prepared to cope, given the outright climate change denial espoused by many southern politicians.\nHow can a region that finds talking about climate change uncomfortable build up smart levels of resilience to face an increase in heat-related deaths, energy costs, flooding, and a decrease in agricultural output and outdoor labor productivity?\nHow can it prepare new power grids and a ready and willing workforce for the green economy?\nHow can a region so heavily invested in its Christian identity deny, ignore or talk around a problem that\u2019s going to hit its poorest and most vulnerable the hardest?\nIf the south is to build resilience in the face of climate change, hearts, minds and policy will have to change quickly. Otherwise, the region will face further, and potentially catastrophic, losses to culture, landscape, property and biodiversity. But the extreme politicization of climate change in the south, paired with the often condescending stance of the already converted believers, makes this much-needed cultural shift a hard sell.\nI know what it\u2019s like to move out of a classic red state mentality; it\u2019s an awkward leap, like crashing a party you weren\u2019t invited to. It\u2019s a new language, accent, code. Sometimes it feels like trying to sit with a smug group of high schoolers in the cafeteria who profess to have better taste in music. But in 2018, it\u2019s in our shared interest to make conservation conversations easier to join.\nI think a lot about conversion moments, what it takes to move from a place of cold denial to complexity or increased understanding. These moments are often experiential. I wish that more people were afforded the opportunity to decamp from regionalist mentalities, political ideology and ivory towers and witness the humanity of the \u201cother side\u201d \u2013 or, as those of us who revere the natural world would say, the sheer interconnectedness of all species.\nI think of the Federal Writer\u2019s Project, when writers like Eudora Welty and Zora Neale Hurston got out into the field and attempted to capture the south in a time of profound struggle and change. Hurston wrote of Florida in her proposal, \u201cThere is still an opportunity to observe the wombs of folk culture still heavy with life.\u201d The American south is again in a poignant moment, culturally heavy with life, with a force stronger than the Great Depression beginning to shape it. I want to bear witness to what\u2019s hanging in the balance, get real about the stakes.\nOne summer night, while out in the field in such a way, on the roof of a shrimp boat in the middle of the Ogeechee river off the coast of Georgia, I sat with a diverse group of southern artists and conservationists and watched the moon rise over the salt marsh. We found ourselves discussing conservation\u2019s race problem; the continued glorification of plantation culture; the danger of anti-science mentalities in schools; the language southerners use to avoid using the politicized term \u201cclimate change\u201d.\nThat night, we told stories about the changes we\u2019re already seeing, and the financial and spiritual impact on real people we know. We wondered about the future of coastal real estate, the art that will rise from this tense moment, and where the evangelicals are when it comes to protecting Earth, or, as some say, the Creation.\nThese are conversations I\u2019ve always wanted to have, questions I\u2019ve always wanted to ask. I\u2019ll continue to explore them in a column here, with you.\nOne of the reasons I will forever be homesick for the landscape of the south, in the vague sense of hiraeth, is that none of us can truly return to the landscapes of our youth. We are no longer waiting for climate change; it is well upon us. We are already in the process of being shaped and displaced. We are bearing witness to a climate already changed.", "label": 0}, "text-300": {"text": "Patriotism could be the unlikely answer to solving the climate crisis\nWhen it comes to fighting climate change and its effects, both greens and conservatives pay far too much attention to localism, voluntarism, and corporate responsibility. All are valuable; none are adequate. If, as many environmentalists say, the struggle against global heating requires a sense of wartime emergency, then fighting it while chiefly relying on these assets is as if Britain fought the Second World War relying on the Home Guard.\nLast week\u2019s budget contained some useful steps to limit carbon emissions; but they are far too small, and offset by road construction and the failure to lift the freeze on fuel taxes brought in 10 years ago. \nClimate change, if unchecked, threatens the destruction of Britain; yet the new money allocated to combat it is less than one fifteenth of the annual defence bill and well under half the cost of the two Royal Navy aircraft carriers \u2013 which increasingly seem to have no national strategic purpose.\nThe best way of looking at the idea of state-led national green new deals is to see them as the latest episode in the 200-year-old history of efforts to save capitalism from itself. The difference is that in the past, unrestrained capitalism could only destroy one country\u2019s political and economic order. Today, by continuing to boost carbon emissions, it can destroy the whole of modern civilisation.\nCapitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before 2008, we know it now\nThroughout modern history, just as today, there have been capitalists, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, who have called for the reform of capitalism, whether from conscience or fear of revolution, but, in the end, parliaments still had to pass the laws and states had to implement them. If we had left it to capitalism to regulate itself, seven-year-olds would still be working down coal mines \u2013 or, more likely, Britain would have collapsed into communism. Capitalism, when left alone, cannot regulate itself. If we did not know that before the crash of 2008, we certainly know it now.\nCentral to the taming of capitalism has always been the creation of welfare states. Enhanced social security and state healthcare as part of any green new deal are essential to the fight to limit carbon emissions for three reasons: to compensate those workers and sections of society that will suffer as a result of the abandonment of fossil fuels; to make the necessary sacrifices politically possible by sharing those sacrifices through progressive taxation; and to build the social and national resilience which we will need if our democratic orders are to survive the shocks of the decades to come \u2013 including the spread of tropical diseases as a result of climate change.\nThis need for social solidarity links the green new deal to the patriotic origins of the welfare state. Both conservatives and socialists have agreed in attributing the welfare state to socialism; conservatives because they have come to dislike it, the left because they want to claim all credit for it.\nIn fact, the origins of the British welfare state lie very largely in the social imperialism movement in the years before 1914. The supporters of this movement were an extraordinarily varied bunch: H G Wells, George Bernard Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the left; liberal imperialists such as Winston Churchill and William Beveridge; patriotic writers including Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle; imperial bureaucrats such as Lord Milner and John Buchan; and soldiers including Field Marshal Lord Roberts. Their thinking echoed, in key respects, Bismarck\u2019s social security programme in Germany and the reformist \u201cnew nationalism\u201d of Theodore Roosevelt in the US.\nAs Lord Roberts declared: \u201cTo tens of thousands of Englishmen engaged in daily toil, the call to \u2018sacrifice\u2019 themselves for their country must seem an insult to their reason; for those conditions amid which they work make their lives already an unending sacrifice.\u201d\nWhat all these figures had in common was a fear of social disintegration and revolution; a belief (right or wrong) in the British Empire as a force for progress; and a belief that social solidarity, \u201cnational efficiency\u201d, and a degree of national self-sufficiency were essential to survive what they (correctly) saw would be the colossal social, economic and political strains of a new European war.\nMy own thinking about this has also been shaped by my experience of working in Qatar, which has engaged in an intense and successful state-led effort at national self-sufficiency in response to the blockade by Saudi Arabia and other neighbours.\nThe social imperialist tradition flowed into the later development of the welfare state as a result of the Second World War. In the course of these conflicts most of the Labour party became intensely patriotic, while the Conservatives became one-nation Tories, committed to social solidarity and state involvement in the economy.\nWhen, in 1960, Bernard Semmel wrote his classic study of social imperialism, Imperialism and Social Reform, he took for granted its victory on both sides of the political spectrum: \u201cToday, the Cobdenites [ie radical free-market liberals] and the international socialists are virtually extinct breeds.\u201d\nThis is the spirit we need to recover in response to the climate emergency and associated menaces. International agreements and protest movements are valuable and necessary but they can\u2019t do anything themselves. Their purpose is to nudge and shame states into taking action. And state governments, in the end, take action on behalf of their national populations. That is their duty, and it is also what those populations expect and vote for.\nThe task then is to mobilise patriotism by convincing national populations that global heating is a threat, not just to humanity and the planet but to the interests and the future survival of their own countries; and that society, as a whole, will pull together, alleviate suffering and make sacrifices as part of a common effort.\nIf we can\u2019t manage this I very much doubt that liberal democracy will survive what is coming at us down the line.\n\u2022 Anatol Lieven is the author of Climate Change and the Nation State: The Realist Case", "label": 0}, "text-301": {"text": "Britain\u2019s new political landscape: what the voting numbers tell us\nThe exit poll stunned us all again. In 2017 it raised the curtain on a night of humiliation for Theresa May and the Conservatives and triumph for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn. This time the roles were reversed. Boris Johnson succeeded where May failed, mobilising Leave voters\u2019 frustration at Brexit deadlock to secure the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s third victory in 1987, and the largest share of the vote (44%) won by any party since Thatcher\u2019s first win in 1979. Corbyn secured a \u201cglorious defeat\u201d in the summer of 2017, when a surge in Labour support saw the party advance in defiance of expectations of disaster.\nThe defeat this time was not glorious. Labour fell everywhere, but the party collapsed in its northern and Midlands heartlands where voters have returned Labour MPs for generations. The \u201cred wall\u201d collapsed, and Corbyn\u2019s party was left to pick through the rubble of its worst defeat in more than 80 years.\nLast Thursday I worked at BBC HQ with the team headed by Professor John Curtice to produce the poll released at 10pm on the BBC and ITV that predicted the new political shape of Britain. The security was watertight \u2013 our phones were taken from us, and we had to be escorted to and from the toilets.\nThe early declaration of Blyth Valley made clear why the exit poll was projecting the largest Conservative majority for more than 30 years. The Tories took this north-east mining seat for the first time since 1935 on a dramatic 10-point swing. Further shock defeats soon followed in Workington, Darlington and most dramatically in Leigh, the rock-solid north-west seat formerly held by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\nThis set the pattern for the night: a general slump in Labour support, with huge swings to the Conservatives in older, white, working-class urban seats with many voters who left school with little in the way of educational qualifications. Brexit was a key driver of these shifts. The higher the Leave share, the greater the Tory gain, rising from a modest two-point swing in seats with a Leave vote below 45% to a whopping eight-point swing in seats where 60% or more voted Leave in 2016.\nAbstract voting statistics cannot capture the crushing emotional blow of this defeat. Seat after seat that had backed Labour in every vote since at least 1945 abandoned the party, many electing Conservative MPs for the first time ever. Rother Valley, Labour since 1918: gone. West Bromwich East, Tom Watson\u2019s former fortress: gone. Stoke-on-Trent Central and Stoke-on-Trent North, both Labour since 1935: gone. In the former mining seat of Bolsover, the former miner Dennis Skinner was ejected after 49 years serving a seat that has returned Labour MPs for nearly twice as long. Then, at 3.30am, minutes after Corbyn delivered a defiant address from his Islington count, the returning officer in Sedgefield announced the first Tory victory in 88 years in Tony Blair\u2019s old seat.\nThis was total repudiation. Labour returned its smallest cohort of MPs since 1935, and the prospect of power looks more remote than at any time since the early 1980s. Yet even in 1983, the party was suffering just its second successive defeat, and even this could be blamed on a divided vote following the SDP split. In 2019, Labour faced a fourth, crushing defeat in a row to a Tory party that has governed for nearly a decade, yet grown its vote each time it faced the electorate.\nLabour was not the only party bitterly disappointed by last week\u2019s results. The Liberal Democrats entered the campaign with high hopes of mobilising opposition to Brexit to secure an electoral breakthrough, returning the party to relevance after four post-coalition years in the wilderness. Party leader Jo Swinson even sought to present herself as a prime minister in waiting. It was not to be. The party that had sought a Remain realignment finished with fewer seats than before, as just three gains in strongly Remain areas were more than offset by four losses of seats won in 2017, including Swinson\u2019s as she was defeated by the SNP in East Dunbartonshire. The party can at least take some consolation from the substantial increase in its vote share in the most middle-class and Remain areas of London and south England, which leave it well placed to benefit at future elections if the Conservatives\u2019 growing alignment with nationalist and Eurosceptic voters alienates its traditional support base in suburbia.\nThe Brexit party also proved an electoral flop, its thunder stolen by a prime minister who talked of little else but \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Nigel Farage\u2019s new outfit secured just 2% of the overall vote, though this low figure in part reflects the party\u2019s decision to stand candidates down in Conservative-held seats. The Brexit party secured an average of more than 5% in the seats where it did stand, and the main effect of its strongest performances was most likely to prevent even more Tory breakthroughs, helping to save Labour incumbents including Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and John Healey by splitting the Leave vote.\nThis was also a night of crushing disappointment for the many defectors and independents who sought to put principle before party. The Liberal Democrats fielded new recruits from both Labour (including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger) and the Conservatives (including Sarah Wollaston and Sam Gymiah). All were defeated. Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, expelled from the Conservatives for rebellions over Brexit, achieved large swings as independents but could not break traditional voter alignments in their safe Tory seats. The various former Labour and Conservative MPs who broke away at the start of the year to form Change UK, and mostly now stood as independents, fared even worse, while Chris Williamson lost his deposit standing as an independent after being expelled from the Labour party.. Local roots matter more than national arguments, with the strongest independent performances on the night both coming from homegrown independent candidates in Ashfield and Devon East.\nThe two governing parties in Northern Ireland also had a very bad night, as Remain-supporting opposition parties surged in the region set to be hardest hit by Brexit. The DUP lost two seats, with its Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, defeated by Sinn F\u00e9in in North Belfast. The SDLP took a seat each from Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP on huge swings, while the cross-community Alliance party took North Down and ran the DUP very close in East Belfast. These results could herald major changes in the balance of power if, as expected, another election is called in the province next year to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland assembly.\nThe Conservatives were not the only governing party to advance. The SNP, which has ruled at Holyrood since 2007, secured its second Westminster landslide in four years. The SNP slumped in 2017, when its campaign for a second independence referendum turned unionist and Leave voters against it. Two years later, the imminence of a hard Brexit under Johnson has renewed the appeal of independence, and the SNP has 48 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats.\nThe Scottish Conservatives gave up more than half of the seats gained in 2017, but the biggest loser was Scottish Labour, once again reduced to a single seat on its lowest ever share of the vote. The SNP\u2019s triumph makes a new constitutional clash highly likely in the coming parliament, as a party determined to secure a mandate for independence faces a prime minister firmly opposed to a second Scottish referendum on the issue.\nThe return of a large and loyal majority will transform the Brexit legislative process. The narrow votes and high drama of the past two years will be at an end. Johnson can go to Brussels safe in the knowledge that any deal he negotiates will pass smoothly through the Commons. Brexit will get done.\nThe harder task comes after that. Johnson\u2019s party may be united (at last) over Brexit, but the places it represents are now drawn from opposite sides of a deeply divided nation. The newly elected Conservative MPs represent some of the poorest parts of the country, joining party veterans who represent some of the wealthiest seats. The government will face a new pressure to spend and invest from the party\u2019s new MPs, who will want to show that \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d delivers some tangible results for constituents in their marginal seats. But big spending runs very much against the ideological grain for the Conservative party, and the challenges such seats face after decades of stagnation and neglect cannot realistically be addressed in a single term of government. Voters who discover that Brexit brings little positive change to their lives may soon turn against a party they have long disliked and still distrust.\nThe Conservatives\u2019 future troubles are as nothing compared with the existential crisis facing Labour. The electorate has rejected Corbyn and Corbynism, but loyalists to the radical cause control the commanding heights of the party. Its future direction now lies in the hands of the huge membership Corbyn attracted, who will soon be asked to choose his successor. Will they see this electoral mauling as a signal to change course, or will they regard it as an aberration driven by Brexit fever?\nFurther strife seems inevitable whatever answer the party\u2019s members deliver. The dramas of a gridlocked Commons may be over, for now. But those hoping for a return to boring politics in the new year may be disappointed.\nDr Rob Ford is a professor of politics at Manchester University", "label": 0}, "text-302": {"text": "BeIN Sports chief in World Athletics Championships corruption inquiry\nThe chief executive of the Qatari media group beIN is under investigation for corruption by the French authorities, who suspect he paid bribes in a bid to help Doha host the World Athletics Championships.\nYousef al-Obaidly, who is on the board of directors at Paris Saint-Germain, is also under judicial investigation for \u201caggravated money laundering\u201d according to Le Monde.

Sacred Games was a phenomenon in India, but the show was watched by twice as many people outside the country, according to Netflix.\n\u201cWhat we managed with Sacred Games is to create a sense of time and place,\u201d Kashyap told me at June\u2019s London Indian film festival. \u201cHindi cinema doesn\u2019t give you that context; they\u2019re stories set in la la land: it could be India, it could be Mexico, it could be anywhere. But through Sacred Games you also understand the country, and that, for me, is the hallmark of a great show.\u201d\nKashyap\u2019s relationship with Netflix began when they acquired his celebrated 2013 movie Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 a five-hour smalltown gangster epic in two parts. Netflix producer Erik Barmack reached out to Kashyap and his production partner Vikramaditya Motwane (who co-directs Sacred Games), and things moved along quickly. \u201cThey gave me a lot of freedom to work the way I wanted, to change the script, improvising, changing the cast. Normally that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he says. \u201cNetflix is like home. I can sit round a table and argue and discuss and fight about the content I\u2019m trying to do, but after all the conflict, they actually listen to you.\u201d He is already developing other projects with the company.\nSacred Games is not the only boundary-pushing Indian show Netflix has released. There is supernatural horror Ghoul, set in a detention facility in a near-future India under martial law due to sectarian violence. There is cricketing drama Selection Day, based on the book by Booker prize-winner Aravind Adiga, and directed by British-Indian Udayan Prasad. On a very different tack was Lust Stories, an anthology of short films by four directors (including Kashyap), all focusing on female sexuality. In one of them, a married school teacher (Radhika Apte, who also stars in Sacred Games and Ghoul) has an affair with a pupil. In another, an unsatisfied bride-to-be borrows her friend\u2019s bullet vibrator \u2013 cue comedy mix-ups with the TV remote. Amazon has also put out provocative content, such as Mirzapur, a crime saga infused with sex and violence, that would not get past the cinema censors.\nAt the other end of the spectrum was this year\u2019s Delhi Crime, based on the horrific gang rape, torture and murder of Jyoti Singh on a Delhi bus in 2012. The incident provoked an international outrage and mass protests across India, but Delhi Crime focuses on the manhunt for the six perpetrators, based on the real-life case files. The investigation is spearheaded by a female deputy police commissioner. Having seen the victim\u2019s condition in hospital on the first night, she personally takes charge of the case, and barely sleeps or goes home until she has caught the men \u2013 which took just six days. Powerfully portrayed by Shefali Shah, she is a different kind of heroine to the Bollywood norm: fortysomething, a sympathetic mother but also a formidable leader, who insists everything is done by the book. \u201cI believe the case was solved because this woman reacted as a human being and said, \u2018OK, this is one of those not-on-my-watch moments,\u2019\u201d says writer and director Richie Mehta.\nIf Sacred Games is India\u2019s answer to Narcos, Delhi Crime is closer to The Wire: a pacy police procedural that doubles as a wide-ranging societal survey. Although it is sympathetic towards the police, the series hardly casts India in a flattering light. This is a landscape of institutional sexism, societal indifference, self-serving politicians, endemic corruption, press leaks, power cuts, pollution and badly funded public services. Even to get a forensic team to a crime scene requires twisting arms and calling in favours.\nLike Kashyap, Mehta is something of an outsider: he is primarily based in Canada. He was preparing Delhi Crime as a feature until he met former HBO co-head of drama David Levine, who suggested he turn it into a series. This was three years before Netflix or Amazon came to India, so it was a risky movie. Levine referred him to The Wire to learn the ropes, he says, but he was equally influenced by movies such as The French Connection.\nMehta\u2019s earlier, India-set films, Amal and Siddharth, played at festivals and garnered critical praise, but the reaction to Delhi Crime was of a different order, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything that, once it was released, was essentially within a few days seen by everyone I\u2019d ever known around the world, in every language.\u201d A second season of Delhi Crime is now in the works, with the same cast working on a different case. Mehta is executive producing it, as well as developing new long-form ideas of his own. \u201cBefore I used to say, if it\u2019s going to be a series, it really really needs to be justified, which is still true. But now it\u2019s more the other way round, where I\u2019m like, if it\u2019s a film it\u2019s really got to be justified. My ambition has now increased. I\u2019m starting to conceive of stories that are 10, 15, 20 hours long.\u201d\nEven in cinemas, streaming giants are exerting an influence on Indian cinema, it seems. Out in the UK this month is Photograph, the latest movie from director Ritesh Batra, who scored a global hit with The Lunchbox, a decorous, gastronomic romance set in Mumbai. Photograph operates in a similar vein, bringing together a lowly Mumbai portrait photographer (Siddiqui again) and one of his subjects (wealthier student Sanya Malhotra) whom he convinces to pose as his fiancee to get his grandmother off his back. Like The Lunchbox (whose co-producer, incidentally, was Kashyap), and unlike the harder-hitting Netflix fare, Photograph is a gentle, almost old-fashioned tale of courtship, albeit in a down-to-earth Mumbai setting. It is being released in the UK by Curzon but in the US, India and Japan it is distributed by Amazon Studios, who became involved in the project at an early stage.\nBetween The Lunchbox and Photograph, Batra made two films in English: British drama The Sense of an Ending, adapted from the Julian Barnes novel. Then Our Souls at Night, another tender romance, starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. Redford called him up and asked him to direct it, having seen The Lunchbox. Batra, who is based in New York, seems unfazed by the experience: \u201cRobert is super-collaborative, so is Jane. They were up for anything. We would do 18 takes sometimes.\u201d\nOur Souls at Night was a Netflix production. It almost goes without saying that Batra is now preparing his own long-form web series. All he will reveal is that it is \u201cbased on a great Indian novel\u201d. He cannot say more, although last year Netflix also announced it is making its own version of Salman Rushdie\u2019s Midnight\u2019s Children.\n\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of the streamers and their influence on cinema culture,\u201d Batra says. Indian cinema is something of a closed shop. Even getting The Lunchbox released there was a challenge (although it eventually played in cinemas for nine months). \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get access to cinemas for different kinds of movies. Once something is working you cannot convince people to give the audience variety or choice, you can just keep doing more of the same, but what the streamers will hopefully do is broaden audiences\u2019 palette, so they start demanding different fare in cinemas too. That should be good for the kind of movies that I and other film-makers want to make in India.\u201d\nAll the same, bigger Bollywood players are now getting in on the digital game. Legendary actor Shah Rukh Khan, for example, is producing two new shows for Netflix, a spy thriller and a zombie drama. Screen goddess Madhuri Dixit also produced her own Netflix film, 15 August. Meanwhile, Kabir Khan, who has directed some of the country\u2019s biggest hits, is finishing off an epic series for Amazon on nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, leader of the wartime Indian National Army. And Oscar-winning British film-maker Asif Kapadia is executive-producing The Last Hour, a supernatural thriller series, for Amazon. Netflix also has plenty more to come, including an adaptation of bestseller Cobalt Blue, about a brother and sister who fall for the same man. There are also second series of Delhi Crime, Selection Day and, most anticipated of all, Sacred Games, in mid-August. The first season, which only covered about a third of Vikram Chandra\u2019s source novel, ended on a cliffhanger. The second is set to be even higher profile, inside and outside India.\nCould this be the beginning of a brain-drain in Indian cinema? Could the streaming services start to erode Bollywood? Just as House of Cards marked the start of an exodus from Hollywood to digital platforms, so shows such as Sacred Games could augur the same for India. There is something to lose here. For all its inaccessibility, Bollywood is really the only substantial national cinema that has not been co-opted by the US and other foreign players. As Kashyap puts it: \u201cOur biggest strength is our biggest weakness: that we do not need to sell a single ticket to a non-Indian to sustain ourselves.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game, but the streaming companies have created an extra platform for more outward-facing Indian film-makers such as Kashyap, Mehta and Batra. Having been outsiders, they now find themselves in a position of unprecedented power and influence. The game has changed.\n\u2022 Photograph is released on 2 August and series two of Sacred Games on 15 August.

A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, who also refused to take part.\nThe Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson\u2019s place, accusing them of \u201cconspiring\u201d with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case.\nGove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence.\nThe opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate.\nJohnson\u2019s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be \u201csiloed\u201d.\nThe leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives\u2019 pledge for net zero by 2050.\nThe expansion of Heathrow airport \u2013 passed by MPs last year \u2013 and the HS2 rail link were all discussed.\nSi\u00e2n Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted.\n\u201cThe question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,\u201d said Berry.\nChallenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: \u201cDo people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.\u201d\n\u201cWhere flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,\u201d said Sturgeon.\nThe Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper.\n\u201cI think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,\u201d he said.\nMore than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets.\nCorbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: \u201cWe can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.\u201d\nHundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson\u2019s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson \u2013 who was present at the studio \u2013 said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he \u201cwould have made a big, big contribution\u201d.\nHe insisted that Gove\u2019s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: \u201cGove on!\u201d\nOn leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson\u2019s failure to attend and the Tories\u2019 green policies.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: \u201cI asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn\u2019t here today.\u201d\nHe told her that it shouldn\u2019t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. \u201cThis is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven\u2019t seen climate action,\u201d she said.Asked if he looked surprised, she added: \u201cI think older men, quite frankly, aren\u2019t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.\u201d\nThe scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in \u201ca state of planetary emergency\u201d.\nTo meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as \u00a320bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. \nSturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. \n\u201cIf we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,\u201d Sturgeon said.\nSwinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. \u201cBrexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,\u201d she said.\nPrice said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: \u201cWe have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.\u201d\n", "label": 0}, "text-306": {"text": "Vested interests in New Zealand politics are too big to ignore \u2013 we need a royal commission\nWhen two of the three biggest political parties in parliament are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office you know you have a problem.\nDespite New Zealand recently being declared as the least corrupt country on earth, repeated donations and lobbying scandals would suggest that \u2013 like our \u201c100% pure\u201d tourism marketing slogan \u2013 this may be something of a fiction, albeit one enthusiastically touted by authorities to prove we don\u2019t have a problem.\nVested interests in New Zealand politics are now too big to hide or ignore. Over the last two decades, the country has seen political donation and election spending scandals come and go on a regular basis. They\u2019ve involved every party and are clearly systemic.\nLobbying is a particular problem in New Zealand, with a revolving door arrangement between government and lobbyists that is illegal in comparable countries. We have professional lobbyists employed to help run the government and ministerial offices, and senior government staff moving from negotiating coalition agreements one week to heading up lobbying firms the next.\nThis week, former NZ First MP Doug Woolerton, who is a key confidant of Deputy prime minister Winston Peters, was alleged to be operating a fundraising mechanism for his party, while at the same time running a firm that lobbies politicians on behalf of some of those same wealthy donors. \nWoolerton\u2019s NZ First Foundation is now formally under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for allegedly manipulating donations in order to circumvent donation declaration laws. This is proving to be a political nightmare for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, as almost daily revelations about her coalition partner and deputy PM surface in the media.\nOn Tuesday, the NZ First leader Winston Peters responded to the announcement saying: \u201cWe want the truth to be out there, not a whole lot of false allegations.\u201d \nThe National Party has its own problems with the Serious Fraud Office, with four people recently charged in relation to donations made to the party. This week we learned the charges relate to two large donations of $100,000 and $100,050 that were allegedly split into smaller amounts not required to be publicly declared.  National has responded by pointing out that none of the four individuals being charged are MPs or party office-holders.\nWhatever the truth of the allegations, the bigger impact of these scandals is to bring New Zealand\u2019s electoral process into disrepute. This is a good thing. New Zealand has been complacent about the question of corruption for too long, helped along by regularly featuring at the top of Transparency International\u2019s annual Corruption Perception Index.\nThe public doesn\u2019t entirely buy the corruption-free status. A survey commissioned last year by Victoria University of Wellington found that 34% believed that \u201ccorruption is widespread throughout the government in New Zealand\u201d. While perhaps low by international standards, it\u2019s worth noting that a similar survey question from six years earlier, had only 24% agreeing with this. Last year\u2019s survey also found 71% had either no or very little confidence in how political parties are funded.\nNew Zealanders are right to be suspicious of the influence of wealthy and vested interests. After all, time and again governments make decisions geared towards the type of people and organisations who fund our parties.\nIs it any surprise, for example, that successive governments refuse to fix the taxation system, the housing affordability crisis, or deal adequately with a moribund welfare state when the wealthy exert such financial power over our politicians?\nPoliticians themselves cannot be trusted to fix the problem. Self-interest typically characterises their reforms, regardless of which party is driving them.\nThere will be a temptation to make changes in haste, as the government did late last year, bringing in new laws which were meant to ban foreign donations, but were universally panned as ineffective.\nThere is merit in tightening up donations rules and lowering thresholds for donation disclosure. But ultimately, the problems of money and politics are far bigger than such tweaks allow for. Our whole parliamentary and political system is deficient, especially when it comes to how political parties operate. Parties were once mass membership organisations that engaged, organised and fundraised on a grassroots level. Nowadays they are largely empty shells, presided over by elite professional staff and career politicians. It\u2019s a recipe for vested interest to dominate, and they do.\nIn the 1980s when a crisis of confidence was developing about the old First-Past-the-Post electoral system, the Labour Government of the time did the right thing by establishing The Royal Commission on the Electoral System. This made the case for our MMP system, which was eventually adopted by voters in a referendum.\nIt\u2019s time for a new Royal Commission to take the problems of vested interests in politics out of the hands of politicians and come up with a fundamental rethink of how to deal with money in politics.\n", "label": 0}, "text-307": {"text": "Oil firms risk public backlash if profits put before climate, says IEA\nThe world\u2019s energy watchdog has warned the oil and gas industry that it risks a public backlash by failing to act on the climate crisis in favour of making short-term profits.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil companies must balance their desire for near-term returns and a long-term future by playing a much more significant role in combating the climate crisis.\nThe IEA is preparing to make its most direct call for oil companies to help tackle the climate crisis at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday.\nThe oil and gas industry faces \u201ctwin threats\u201d to its financial profitability and social acceptability, according to the IEA.\n\u201cThere are already signs of both, whether in financial markets or in the reflexive antipathy towards fossil fuels that is increasingly visible in the public debate, at least in parts of Europe and North America,\u201d it said.\nFatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cNo energy company will be unaffected by clean-energy transitions. Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option.\u201d\nThe report said that although some oil and gas companies have taken steps to support efforts to combat the climate crisis, the industry as a whole could play a much more significant role.\nOil companies could do more now to help shrink the industry\u2019s giant carbon footprint but most companies were yet to play a meaningful role, according to the report.\nThe world\u2019s oil companies have channelled less than 1% of their spending towards alternative energy technologies outside of oil and gas, despite growing calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The leading oil companies spend about 5%, the report said.\nThe IEA has called on the oil industry to use its \u201cextensive knowhow and deep pockets\u201d to help accelerate the development of clean energy and carbon capture technologies that could help absorb the greenhouse gas from factories before they enter the atmosphere.\nLast week Microsoft announced plans to establish a $1bn (\u00a3770m) fund dedicated to \u201ccarbon reduction, capture, and removal technologies\u201d and aims to become \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030. The IEA report found that the combined spending of large oil and gas companies in projects beyond oil and gas was just over $2bn last year.\n\u201cWithout the industry\u2019s input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,\u201d Birol said.\n\u201cThe first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the carbon footprint of their own operations. As of today, around 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers.\u201d\nBirol said a large part of these emissions could be brought down relatively quickly and easily by investing in technology that can stop methane leaking from fossil fuel projects into the atmosphere.\nThe IEA has faced scathing criticism in the past that it is undermining the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy by mapping out influential future energy scenarios \u2013 used by governments to help set energy policy \u2013 which are not aligned with global climate targets.\nThe IEA has called for a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of policymakers, investors and oil executives to work together to tackle the climate crisis but this is the first report to focus directly on the role for oil and gas companies in the energy transition.\nIn Europe, major oil companies are facing rising public opposition, including a growing number of cultural institutions that have said they will no longer accept financial support from oil and gas companies.\nLast week the Royal College of General Practitioners cancelled a conference organised by the trade body Oil and Gas UK that was scheduled to take place on its premises later this month because it \u201cconflicts with the college\u2019s longstanding commitment to combat the impact of climate change on the environment and on the health of our patients\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-308": {"text": "Sekiro, Baba Is You and the politics of video game difficulty\nAs a one-armed orphan \u2013 a disability that you might think would disqualify him from the opportunity to work as a lone assassin in 16th-century Japan \u2013 Sekiro is well acquainted with disadvantage. Still, a smooth sea never made a skilful mariner, as they used to say, and these physical and psychological handicaps have only served to strengthen this shinobi, who, with a variety of terrifying prosthetics, must now avenge his fallen master by taking down the Ashina clan. Up close, this is grindcore game-making, in which you are forced to watch the lolling of your victims\u2019 astonished mouths as you trace a katana across their necks. This world of blood, fire and pitter-patter footsteps across bamboo rooftops calls to mind Toshiya Fujita\u2019s Lady Snowblood or Akira Kurosawa\u2019s Sanjuro in both theme and body count. But in its moments of exquisite pause, it\u2019s also a game of refined cinematic style, the traumatised ninja silhouetted against a flaring sunset, while the reeds rustle and soothe.\nA purging influence, Sekiro must rid this sickly world of its cruel men and monsters. Stealth is the dominant mode; you crouch in tall grass, duck under the floor beams, and, with your grappling hook, perch silently on rooftops. It\u2019s possible to strike decisively at grunts from the shadows, but sooner or later you face one of the Goliath-esque named foes that punctuate this world, roadblocks that will only topple in open combat. Without a shield behind which to cringe and circle, you are forced to trade explosive blows, timing your feints, parries and counterattacks with a maestro\u2019s precision.

In the medium\u2019s formative, arcade-based years, a game\u2019s challenge was an economic concern. Too easy and players would hog the machine without spending extra credits, making the game a poor earner; too difficult and no one would bother to play. When video games moved into our homes, the pay-per-play model disappeared; now designers could make a game as forgiving or brutal as they liked. Most tried to accommodate varying levels of player ability or physical capacity by offering multiple difficulty settings. In recent years, however, there has been a trend for games that, like Sekiro or Sudoku, demand players rise to an unmodifiable challenge.\nSome progressives believe that games should be accessible to allcomers, offering in-built concessions to those unable, for whatever reason, to progress. Difficulty, they argue, is a weapon used to exclude \u2013 an issue for an industry that has, in the past, harmfully cultivated an audience of near-fanatical young men. Others counter that the calibration of difficulty is, in essence, an artistic choice. To demand a designer \u201cdumb down\u201d their game is akin to asking for a monosyllabic edition of the works of Proust. You might gain readers in doing so, but at what cost?\nGames developed by Japanese company Software have become synonymous with a design approach that requires the player to, through repeated failure, acquire highly tuned muscle memory and eventually the required skill to achieve success. The studio\u2019s head, the lovable Hidetaka Miyazaki, has said that his games are intended for players who want to persevere in search of \u201ca feeling of accomplishment that may be relatively rare among other games\u201d, a point of view that carries the implicit suggestion that not every game need cater to every person.\nIt\u2019s a position shared by Baba Is You, an indie game made by the Finnish designer Arvi Teikari, and developed at the opposite end of the budgetary spectrum to Sekiro. It\u2019s a puzzle title in which you manoeuvre your character toward a flag that, when touched, completes the challenge. The flag, invariably, sits out of reach. Each level is filled with blocks containing verbs and nouns, which are arranged in logical sentences that set the rules of the puzzle. One string of blocks might read \u201cwall\u201d, \u201cis\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d. Break the sentence by shunting \u201cstop\u201d away from the other blocks and you break the rule; now you are able to pass freely through walls and reach the flag.\nFrom this simple premise, Teikari spins dozens of ingenious challenges, many of which have more than one solution. Game worlds, like ours, are made up of thousands of tiny strings of logic and Baba Is You is an invitation to play the role of a chaotic god, rewriting the rules of the universe. Unlike Sekiro, however, which presents new challenges that build upon the lessons of the old, Baba Is You often discards that which you learn from level to level, undermining what might otherwise be a delightful arc of educational progress. Neither game is wrong or right in its challenging approach; both ignite fraught discussion about who games are for, and the tension between artistic intent and audience gatekeeping.\nTom Clancy\u2019s The Division 2(Massive Entertainment/Ubisoft; PC, PS4, Xbox One)\nThe latest military-skinned game in the Clancy-industrial complex is set in a Washington DC that has descended into anarchy.

Trump then doubled down on his attacks against them Monday morning following Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s appearance on Fox & Friends. \u201cWe all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of Communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own Country,\u201d the president tweeted, quoting Graham. \u201cThey are Anti-Semitic, they are Anti-America, we don\u2019t need to know anything about them personally, talk about their policies.\u201d\nAfter less than a year in office, the members of the Squad have greatly expanded the realm of political possibility in the United States\nAnd yet it is precisely their policies that have Trump and the Republicans worked up into a frothy lather. The members of the Squad, in stark contrast to not only the Republicans but the rest of the Democrats, have championed progressive policy proposals \u2013 from the Green New Deal to Medicare for All to student debt cancellation to abolishing Ice and the Department of Homeland Security to increasing the top marginal tax rate to 70%.\nThese proposals are popular, and not only among liberal Democrats, but across a wide swath of the American public. A poll conducted earlier this year found that 60% of independent voters supported Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 70% top tax-rate proposal, as did 45% of Republicans. Polls consistently show a clear majority of Americans back Medicare for All. Even as sweeping a proposal as the Green New Deal enjoys more support than opposition among likely voters, Obama-to-Trump voters and moderates. There is an obvious desire for the kind of transformational politics that the members of the Squad have brought to Congress.\nIndeed, while much of the media coverage of the various Squad members have focused on their identities, their appeal goes far beyond matters of representation. Of course, representation is important, and the Squad, comprising women of color, represents important \u201cfirsts\u201d \u2013 the first Muslim-American congresswomen, the youngest ever member of Congress, the first black female representative from Massachusetts. They represent what America looks like today far better than the pale, greying gerontocracy that rules the country. At 45, Pressley is the oldest member of the Squad; Nancy Pelosi, for comparison, is 79 and Trump, 73.\nBut what distinguishes them as much as who they are is what they have done. After less than a year in office, the members of the Squad have greatly expanded the realm of political possibility in the United States. They have energized the Democratic party base with a fighting progressivism, choosing open confrontation with the Republicans over the tepid triangulation that the Democrats have longed preferred \u2013 and which the party\u2019s leadership mistakenly still does. They speak not in focus-grouped platitudes but with real passion and empathy for ordinary people\u2019s pain. It is for this reason that they have succeeded in connecting with the wider public. It is why they dominate the news day after day. And it is why they drive Trump and the Republicans crazy. In the Squad \u2013 diverse, comparatively young, energetic and charismatic \u2013 Trump and the Republicans see their own impending political and literal obsolescence.\nWhat distinguishes them [the Squad] as much as who they are is what they have done\nFaced with the prospect of multiracial social democracy that the members of the Squad represent, Trump and the Republicans are employing the same tactics to thwart progressive political change and sabotage redistributivist policies that defenders of the existing order have used throughout American history. They seek to sow distrust among the vulnerable and the marginalized, to divide working-class people of color and working-class white people, and, now, to pit Muslims and Jews against one another. Afraid of losing their grip on power, they have opted to instill fear and terror in the American public through both their rhetoric \u2013 the demonization of immigrants, the delegitimization of dissent \u2013 and their policies \u2013 Ice raids across US cities and the initial steps towards a war with Iran. And in statehouses around the country, Republicans are working to guarantee white minority rule into perpetuity as the country\u2019s demographics shift.\nIf there is a lesson from Trump\u2019s most recent racist tirade, it is that between the Republicans\u2019 xenophobic nationalism and the Squad\u2019s multiracial social democracy, there is no longer a viable middle ground. In a show of rank pettiness and political irresponsibility, the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, lashed out at the Squad in an interview with the New York Times, and the official House Democrats\u2019 Twitter account, controlled by corporate Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, fired off a vicious attack on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff. These attempts by the centrist Democratic leadership to challenge the Squad\u2019s progressive agenda only backfired, opening the door for Trump, whose sole natural talent may be trolling, to exploit the Democrats\u2019 intra-party divisions. And yet by Monday, the Democrats\u2019 leadership had lined up to defend Ocasio-Cortez and the other members of the Squad.\nWhat this made clear is the fact that it is not Pelosi or Jeffries or Schumer who is leading the opposition to Trump but the Squad: four, first-year congresswomen who have presented a coherent, comprehensive alternative not only to the odious Republicans but to the feckless moderates within their own party. That there are so few members of the Squad, and that they are so easily identifiable, reflects the sorry state of the Democrats. But the Squad has also shown the power of an unabashedly progressive politics in style as well as substance. They are popular, so are their policies. And this has everyone who opposes them \u2013 from Trump and the Republicans to Pelosi and the centrist Democrats \u2013 terrified.\nJoshua Leifer is an associate editor at Dissent", "label": 0}, "text-310": {"text": "Putting the 'con' in consensus; Not only is there no 97 per cent consensus among climate scientists, many misunderstand core issues\n\nIn the lead-up to the Paris climate summit, massive activist pressure is on all governments, especially Canada\u2019s, to fall in line with the global warming agenda and accept emission targets that could seriously harm our economy. One of the most powerful rhetorical weapons being deployed is the claim that 97 per cent of the world\u2019s scientists agree what the problem is and what we have to do about it. In the face of such near-unanimity, it would be understandable if Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Canadian government were simply to capitulate and throw Canada\u2019s economy under the climate change bandwagon. But it would be a tragedy because the 97 per cent claim is a fabrication.\n\nLike so much else in the climate change debate, one needs to check the numbers. First of all, on what exactly are 97 per cent of experts supposed to agree? In 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama sent out a tweet claiming 97 per cent of climate experts believe global warming is \u201creal, man-made and dangerous.\u201d As it turns out, the survey he was referring to didn\u2019t ask that question, so he was basically making it up. At a recent debate in New Orleans, I heard climate activist Bill McKibben claim there was a consensus that greenhouse gases are \u201ca grave danger.\u201d But when challenged for the source of his claim, he promptly withdrew it.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change asserts the conclusion that most (more than 50 per cent) of the post-1950 global warming is due to human activity, chiefly greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. But it does not survey its own contributors, let alone anyone else, so we do not know how many experts agree with it. And the statement, even if true, does not imply that we face a crisis requiring massive restructuring of the worldwide economy. In fact, it is consistent with the view that the benefits of fossil fuel use greatly outweigh the climate-related costs.\n\nOne commonly cited survey asked if carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and human activities contribute to climate change. But these are trivial statements that even many IPCC skeptics agree with. And again, both statements are consistent with the view that climate change is harmless. So there are no policy implications of such surveys, regardless of the level of agreement.\n\nThe most highly cited paper supposedly found 97 per cent of published scientific studies support man-made global warming. But in addition to poor survey methodology, that tabulation is often misrepresented. Most papers (66 per cent) actually took no position. Of the remaining 34 per cent, 33 per cent supported at least a weak human contribution to global warming. So divide 33 by 34 and you get 97 per cent, but this is unremarkable since the 33 per cent includes many papers that critique key elements of the IPCC position.\n\nTwo recent surveys shed more light on what atmospheric scientists actually think. Bear in mind that on a topic as complex as climate change, a survey is hardly a reliable guide to scientific truth, but if you want to know how many people agree with your view, a survey is the only way to find out.\n\nIn 2012 the American Meteorological Society (AMS) surveyed its 7,000 members, receiving 1,862 responses. Of those, only 52% said they think global warming over the 20th century has happened and is mostly man-made (the IPCC position). The remaining 48% either think it happened but natural causes explain at least half of it, or it didn\u2019t happen, or they don\u2019t know. Furthermore, 53% agree that there is conflict among AMS members on the question.\n\nSo no sign of a 97% consensus. Not only do about half reject the IPCC conclusion, more than half acknowledge that their profession is split on the issue.\n\nThe Netherlands Environmental Agency recently published a survey of international climate experts. 6550 questionnaires were sent out, and 1868 responses were received, a similar sample and response rate to the AMS survey. In this case the questions referred only to the post-1950 period. 66% agreed with the IPCC that global warming has happened and humans are mostly responsible. The rest either don\u2019t know or think human influence was not dominant. So again, no 97% consensus behind the IPCC.\n\nBut the Dutch survey is even more interesting because of the questions it raises about the level of knowledge of the respondents. Although all were described as \u201cclimate experts,\u201d a large fraction only work in connected fields such as policy analysis, health and engineering, and may not follow the primary physical science literature.\n\nRegarding the recent slowdown in warming, here is what the IPCC said: \u201cThe observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years.\u201d Yet 46 per cent of the Dutch survey respondents - nearly half - believe the warming trend has stayed the same or increased. And only 25 per cent agreed that global warming has been less than projected over the past 15 to 20 years, even though the IPCC reported that 111 out of 114 model projections overestimated warming since 1998.\n\nThree quarters of respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement \u201cClimate is chaotic and cannot be predicted.\u201d Here is what the IPCC said in its 2003 report: \u201cIn climate research and modelling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d\n\nLooking into further detail there are other interesting ways in which the socalled experts are unaware of unresolved discrepancies between models and observations regarding issues like warming in the tropical troposphere and overall climate sensitivity.\n\nWhat can we take away from all this? First, lots of people get called \u201cclimate experts\u201d and contribute to the appearance of consensus, without necessarily being knowledgeable about core issues. A consensus among the misinformed is not worth much.\n\nSecond, it is obvious that the \u201c97%\u201d mantra is untrue. The underlying issues are so complex it is ludicrous to expect unanimity. The near 50/50 split among AMS members on the role of greenhouse gases is a much more accurate picture of the situation. The phoney claim of 97% consensus is mere political rhetoric aimed at stifling debate and intimidating people into silence.\n\nThe Canadian government has the unenviable task of defending the interest of the energy producers and consumers of a cold, thinly-populated country, in the face of furious, deafening global warming alarmism. Some of the worst of it is now emanating from the highest places. Barack Obama\u2019s website (barackobama.com) says \u201c97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and man-made \u2026 Find the deniers near you - and call them out today.\u201d How nice. But what we really need to call out is the use of false propaganda and demagogy to derail factual debate and careful consideration of all facets of the most complex scientific and policy issue of our time.", "label": 1}, "text-311": {"text": "The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) issued a statement last week insisting that climate science claims be verified by observational evidence and scientific testing. The Heartland Institute \u2013 a national think tank that is globally recognized for promoting skepticism about man-caused, catastrophic climate change \u2013 applauds NSTA\u2019s position, which states: \u201cScientific explanations must be consistent with existing empirical evidence or stand up to empirical testing.\u201d\nThe\u00a0Heartland Institute\u00a0could not agree more. Failed climate models and speculative projections that cannot be verified through scientific observations do not constitute \u201cevidence\u201d of anything. They are mere projections and must be verified through scientific observations and \u201cempirical evidence\u201d and \u201cempirical testing.\u201d\nSince the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its First Assessment Report and presented its first climate projection models in 1990, observational evidence has regularly contradicted alarmist climate predictions and vindicated global warming realists.\nFor example, the First Assessment Report predicted 0.3 Celsius degrees of warming each ensuing decade for the following century. Skeptics predicted a continuation of the modest 0.1 degrees Celsius per decade. Since that First Assessment Report, empirical evidence and testing show temperatures have risen merely 0.13 degrees per decade, much closer to skeptic projections than the alarmist projections of 0.3 degrees.\nAs a result, the IPCC has conceded its error and unilaterally split the difference with skeptics, with the IPCC now predicting merely 0.2 degrees warming per decade. As global temperatures continue to warm at the modest pace of 0.13 degrees per decade, the IPCC will soon be forced to make more concessions to empirical evidence vindicating skeptics.\n\u201cIdeas based on political ideologies or pseudoscience that fail these empirical tests do not constitute science and should not be allowed to compromise the teaching of climate science,\u201d the NSTA statement continues. \u201cThese tactics promote the teaching of non-scientific ideas that deliberately misinform students and increase confusion about climate science.\u201d Again, The Heartland Institute wholeheartedly agrees with this admonition.\nSaid\u00a0James Taylor, senior fellow for environment and energy policy at The Heartland Institute:\nThe Heartland Institute and the climate realist community at large are committed to supporting the constant testing of pseudoscientific proclamations and political agendas with real-world evidence. To that end,\u00a0Heartland last week live-streamed a scientific rebuttal\u00a0to the political drivel at California Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s Global Climate Action Summit.\nHeartland also intends to co-sponsor the European Institute for Climate and Energy\u2019s (EIKE) annual International Conference on Climate Change this November in Munich, Germany. Heartland also intends to send a delegation of scientists and policy experts this December to Katowice, Poland, for the next United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP-24). Further cementing its commitment to empirical scientific testing of pseudoscientific theories based on political ideologies, The Heartland Institute and a team of scientists are developing a science guide for teachers and students on important climate change issues. Heartland intends to publish this guide in early 2019.\nThe National Science Teachers Association is correct: All scientific claims, including those related to climate change, must be rigorously tested against empirical scientific evidence. The evidence to date vindicates climate realists in their critiques of alarmist speculation and failed models. The Heartland Institute will continue to advance this important mission, regardless of attacks from political ideologues who seek to shut down scientific investigation and debate.", "label": 1}, "text-312": {"text": "Crisis response: How emergency services have joined the front line of mental health care\nThe last thing a patient experiencing a mental health crisis wants is a long wait in A&E to access specialist help. But for patients at Horton general hospital in Oxfordshire, there was no other option: the emergency psychiatric team is based 27 miles away at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, and the drive to Horton can take more than an hour.\nBut that all changed in October 2016, when the Oxford Health NHS foundation trust began offering Horton patients the option to talk to a John Radcliffe psychiatrist via a video link.\nInitially, says consultant psychiatrist Kezia Lange, some members of the psychiatric team were sceptical about whether it could match the experience of being in the same room as the patient. In practice, she says, staff have been \u201cshocked by how easy it is\u201d. According to Lange, more than 300 patients (80% of the total) have chosen the video link in preference to waiting to see a psychiatrist in person. Despite occasional wifi glitches, the video link, which is offered from a comfortable private room, has worked well even with the most distressed patients \u2013 more than 90% of service users described it as good or excellent.\nTrusts throughout the UK are coping with rising demand from people requiring urgent mental health treatment. The London Ambulance Service NHS trust control room takes 13,000 calls a month related to mental health \u2013 about 10% of all calls. Four years ago it recruited mental health nurses in the control room to provide immediate expert help to callers. \u201cIf someone is very upset, or distressed in any way, a senior mental health nurse is there delivering psychological interventions to help soothe and calm the patient,\u201d says trust mental health lead Carly Lynch. \u201cThey\u2019ll talk to them about what their difficulties might be and who\u2019s best placed to help them.\u201d The patient receives the appropriate help and, in some cases, an ambulance visit is avoided.\nMore recently, in south-east London, mental health nurses have been accompanying paramedics to patients experiencing a mental health emergency to offer immediate help. Nurses rotate between the call centre and the response car.\nSince the service launched last November, it has seen patients with severe problems, including suicidal feelings or a psychotic relapse. The proportion taken to A&E has dropped from 54% to 19%, and the team has received many emails from grateful patients.\nIt has worked well professionally, too. \u201cParamedics have flourished in the team,\u201d says Lynch, \u201cand we\u2019ve all learned things from each other\u201d. The trust now plans to roll out the service across London, and predicts annual mental health hospital admissions could be nearly halved \u2013 from 58,000 to 30,000.\nA similar model, launched in 2016 and involving the Scottish Ambulance Service, is being tested across four health boards. When a caller experiencing a mental health crisis calls 999, emergency staff offer initial emotional support and then, if they would like further mental health support, they are referred to the Distress Brief Intervention service, which provides face-to-face support from a third sector mental health organisation.\nIn Lancashire, a rise in patients presenting with mental health problems at A&E, and an increase in the number of people being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, led to some being placed in acute hospitals out of the local area. It was costly for the trust, but can also be damaging for patients, says Lancashire Care NHS foundation trust\u2019s director of strategic development Sue Moore. \u201cIf you are mentally unwell for a significant period of time, it starts to have an impact on your family relationships, your housing, your finances, your ability to work,\u201d she says.\nMoore\u2019s solution was to offer short-stay crisis houses to those in need of urgent mental health treatment. The accommodation was not only for those who have arrived at A&E in crisis, but people known to and referred by the trust\u2019s community mental health teams. The first, six-bed house opened in May 2017, and another, five-bed house opened last April. The houses, which have gardens, en suite bedrooms, kitchens and communal living rooms, are staffed by health care support workers and peer support workers from the Richmond Fellowship, who help patients learn coping techniques. The trust\u2019s crisis teams also provide intensive individual support.\nThe typical stay in a crisis house is only five days, and 98% of patients leave without requiring another hospital admission. \u201cPeople seem to recover much quicker because they\u2019ve not developed a dependency,\u201d says Moore. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with one patient writing that staff \u201ctalked to me for hours when I felt at my worst\u201d. \nWhile the introduction of the houses has saved the trust \u00a31.3m in out-of-area placements, it has also brought better quality care. \u201cFor me, this is about how you make healthcare human,\u201d says Moore. \u201cYou don\u2019t look at the body part, you look at the whole person.\u201d\n\u2022 In 2016-17, paramedics helped 172,799 people experiencing a mental health crisis in England \u2013 up by 23% compared with the figures for 2014-15\n\u2022 In 2016-17 there was a 32% increase in the number of hours spent by paramedics supporting people with mental health difficulties.

But now scientists fear the climate crisis may be disrupting the ability of corals to synchronise this marine phenomenon, threatening them with extinction.\nA Tel Aviv university study, published in Science, has found the release of eggs and sperm in certain reef-building corals in the Gulf of Eilat in the Red Sea have changed over time and have lost their synchronicity. For a coral, reliant on a chance encounter, timing is everything. But researchers have found some are spawning \u201cout of tune\u201d with normal patterns, with the result that fewer baby corals are forming.\n\u201cCoral spawning \u2026 is one of the greatest examples of synchronised phenomena in nature,\u201d said Professor Yossi Loya, of the university\u2019s School of Zoology. \u201cOnce a year, thousands of corals along hundreds of kilometres of a coral reef release their eggs and sperm simultaneously into the open water, where fertilisation will later take place. Since both the eggs and the sperm of corals can persist only a few hours in the water, the timing of this event is critical.\u201d\nAlthough visually, the coral reefs seemed healthy, the corals suffering a breakdown in spawning synchrony produced fewer baby corals, creating circumstances for extinction. While it is not yet fully understood exactly how spawning synchrony works, scientists say it relies on environmental cues, including sea temperature, solar irradiance, wind, the phase of the moon and the time of sunset.\nThe researchers began monitoring corals in the Gulf of Eilat in 2015 and, over four years, recorded the number of spawning individuals during the annual coral reproductive season, between June and September. They compared spawning timings of five coral species between 2015 and 2018 to results from two other studies conducted on the same species in the 1980s. \n\u201cWe found that, in some of the most abundant coral species, the spawning synchrony had become erratic, contrasting both the widely accepted paradigm of highly synchronous coral spawning and studies performed on the exact same reefs decades ago,\u201d said Tom Shlesinger, a PhD student and co-author of the study.\nTo find out whether this failure in spawning synchrony translated into reproductive failure, they mapped thousands of corals within permanent reef plots, revisiting the plots every year to see how many corals of a given species had died, compared to new juveniles.\n\u201cAlthough it appeared that the overall state of the coral reefs at Eilat was quite good and every year we found many new corals recruiting to the reefs, for those species that are suffering from the breakdown in spawning synchrony, there was a clear lack of recruitment of new juvenile generations, meaning that some species that currently appear to be abundant may actually be nearing extinction through reproductive failure,\u201d said Shlesinger.\nIt is not yet known what was causing the loss of synchrony. However, the researchers found temperature had a \u201cstrong influence\u201d on coral reproductive cycles. In the study region, temperatures are rising \u201cfast\u201d, at rate of 0.31C a decade. Another plausible cause could be endocrine or hormonal disrupting pollutants, accumulating in marine environments, they said. The study was based on five corals; however, the researchers believe their findings could be a warning to other species.\n\u201cRegardless of the exact cause leading to these declines in spawning synchrony, our findings serve as a timely wake-up call to start considering these subtler challenges to coral survival, which are very likely also impacting additional species in other regions,\u201d said Shlesinger. \u201cOn a positive note, identifying early warning signs of such reproductive mismatches will contribute to directing our future research and conservation efforts toward the very species that are at potential risk of decline, long before they even display any visible signs of stress or mortality.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-314": {"text": "Strap in for the Super Bowl of Masonry: 2019 in alternative sports\nAt the start of what is going to be, at least numerically speaking, an odd year, we look ahead to 12 months with no men\u2019s football World Cup or European Championship; a time when, away from the lush pastures of the world\u2019s most popular and attention-demanding sport, the often icy and ignored playing fields of a few different disciplines can finally receive the focus they deserve.\nThe men\u2019s Cricket World Cup starts in May and the rugby version in September, but there is no need to go so long in search of global competition when alternative events already abound like so much January snowfall. Starting with the Men\u2019s Handball World Championship, co-hosted by \u201cthe two handball-loving countries of Germany and Denmark\u201d, which starts on Thursday.\nFor all that the event is about pitting nation against nation in very literally hand-to-hand combat, it is imbued with a spirit of cooperation that does not end with the harmonious hosts. The German singer Dominik Klein \u2013 not to be confused with the German international handball player Dominik Klein, even though he seems to have been chosen quite deliberately for that purpose \u2013 collaborated with the Danish DJ Kongsted to record the official song, the suitably energetic Stand Up Stand Out (\u201cFull arenas and the best handball in the world need a song that gets us all excited and ready to party,\u201d says Klein) while the mascot was designed \u201cpartly by fans\u201d after a global crowdsourcing initiative.\nThis might have been a tactical error.

Take the World Ice Fishing Championship, which starts in Batak, Bulgaria, in a fortnight, and involves contestants drilling access to a frozen lake and attempting to coax fish from its frigid depths by rapidly wiggling their miniature rods. \u201cThis sport is very interesting,\u201d said the Russian Nikolai Volodin after he came 76th in 2017. \u201cChess on ice, you could say.\u201d\nThere are certainly more meaningless things to do on ice, as contestants of this week\u2019s IceSnowFootball World Cup will surely discover.

All will attempt to play the game on the unforgiving terrain of an Alpine ice rink covered in snow, and though it must be extremely hard for players to keep their footing in such conditions, anyone who watched Neymar\u2019s performances in Russia last year will appreciate that the same is sometimes true on perfectly-manicured grass, only without the obvious excuse.\nThose in search of something a little less prone to melting or falling over should look instead to Las Vegas on 23 January, when the Bricklayer World Championship will be not so much played as laid. To the outsider this looks like the undoubted highlight of the industry conference it is crowbarred into, thrillingly entitled World of Concrete, and is apparently known as the \u201cSuper Bowl of Masonry\u201d. It involves two-man teams attempting to build a 26ft 8in, double wythe brick wall over the course of a single hour. The biggest wall wins, though \u201ca team\u2019s final brick count may be adjusted down if judges detect workmanship infractions\u201d.\nThis sounds like exactly the event Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been working towards in recent years, his career having turned into an exercise in putting up barriers both on the pitch and off it, ending up with something curiously like a double wythe wall in that observers increasingly discerned a big gap in the middle where something meaningful might have been. Less promisingly, his final months at Old Trafford were practically littered with workmanship infractions.\nFootball, like most sports, is an inherently competitive endeavour, but as the Bricklayer World Championship suggests, increasingly there is nothing humans will not turn into some kind of battle. Witness the first of this month\u2019s cookery-related contests, the 2019 World Championship Scotch Pie Awards, whose winners will be announced on 15 January. It takes a bit of cheek to apply the word \u201cworld\u201d to a competition with three English finalists, 47 from Scotland and none from anywhere else, or to associate it with 2019 when the pies were both cooked and judged last November, but this is the world we live in.\nThe Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie is a step up in seriousness.

She made the mistake of saying climate change was not making polar bears go extinct and pointed out their numbers have been steadily increasing.

And as Peter points out, freedom and economic growth enables countries to better look after the environment.

Peter Gregory had, meanwhile, sourced among other items of evidence the information that polar bears, far from being in dire straits from climate change as David Attenborough would have us believe, are growing in numbers. And this is because the countries which host them have the wherewithal to study them and protect their populations and ecosystems. The evidence he sourced was from Susan Crockford. The polar bears, like the reefs systems studied by Dr Peter Ridd, seem remarkably resilient in the face of a so-called climate catastrophe.\nPeter Gregory had sourced his information independently of IPA Senior Fellow, Dr Jennifer Marohasy, who was in the late stages process of securing a contribution from Susan Crockford for Climate Change: The Facts 2020.

But of course it would also be disruptive.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nHe said the government\u2019s goal was \u201cto have the minimum social and economic disruption, subject to keeping people safe. So what we are saying right now is that as long as you follow the advice from Public Health England \u2013 wash your hands more often than you would, for 20 seconds and use soap and hot water \u2013 then you should carry on your ordinary business as normal.\u201d\nThe government publishes its official action plan on Tuesday for dealing with the virus. Under the \u201creasonable worst-case scenario\u201d plotted by scientists, it would take several weeks before the number of cases rose to epidemic level, Hancock said, \u201cand then it would be a matter of months until we are through it\u201d.\nThe chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will advise the government on when to take more direct action, taking into consideration what other countries are doing to stop the spread. \u201cIf the rest of the world gives up on containing it then there\u2019s no way that one country, even an island like the UK, will be able to resist,\u201d Hancock told Radio 4, breaking the government\u2019s recent boycott of the show.\nHe said all employees were entitled to statutory sick pay if they had to self-isolate at home. \u201cWe have a statutory sick pay system in this country and self-isolating for medical reasons if you are healthy counts as being sick in the legislation,\u201d he said.\nFreelancers and self-employed workers could apply to the Department for Work and Pensions \u201cif they get into difficulty\u201d.\nHancock said emergency legislation would make it easier to recall retired doctors and other health workers to plug gaps in hospitals and GP surgeries, \u201calso so we can get volunteers more easily into the NHS and social care\u201d. He said he accepted that more patients would need to be cared for at home instead of in hospital if the worst-case scenario came about and 2 million people needed treatment.\n\u201cShould the figures end up as big as that we will have to do things differently. For instance, much more care at home. And anyway, with an infectious disease, home is often the best place, especially for a disease that appears to have a relatively mild impact for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course some people will need support at home.

The health secretary\u2019s only legacy will be how quickly he\u2019s forgotten\nI have never seen such an empty vessel as a cabinet minister\u201d. This is one NHS chief executive\u2019s verdict on Matt Hancock\u2019s stint as health and social care secretary. It is a harsh judgment, but it reflects a widespread view among NHS bosses that if Boris Johnson\u2019s imminent formation of his first government leads to Hancock leaving for another job, few will miss him. Whether he stays or leaves, history will judge his first, possibly only, year running the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) as something odd in ministerial tenures \u2013 an irrelevance.\nHancock is neither liked nor respected by those running NHS trusts. They disliked Andrew Lansley and hated his health and social care bill, but acknowledged his deep thinking about the health service and intense preparation for being the health secretary. They had misgivings about Jeremy Hunt for his alienation of staff in pursuit of the government\u2019s ambition of a \u201cseven-day NHS\u201d, but belatedly respected him for him getting to grips with diffcult issues and ending the NHS\u2019s austerity funding.\nBut Hancock? Privately NHS leaders are highly critical. \u201cHe\u2019s very arrogant. It\u2019s all about his own career,\u201d said one. There is a widespread perception that he has taken the ministerial tendency to chase headlines to unprecedented heights, while showing no deep interest in many key areas of challenge. However, his suggestion during the Tory leadership race of unrestricted entry for overseas doctors and nurses was the sort of bold idea needed if the NHS workforce crisis is to be overcome. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s all about promoting himself and using it as a stepping stone to his next job,\u201d said another NHS chief. There are suggestions that some of Hancock\u2019s own civil servants share these concerns.\nSoon after succeeding Hunt on 10 July last year Hancock identified his three key NHS priorities as understaffing; the prevention of ill-health; and much greater adoption of technology. So, against his self-defined targets, what has he actually done?\nA year on, the NHS\u2019s gravest challenge \u2013 its lack of staff and the impact that is having on services \u2013 remains as serious as ever. The Interim NHS People Plan, published last month, failed to make the radical changes needed to immigration policy, medical training, funding Health Education England properly, restoring bursaries for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, how staff are treated and so on. The plan was issued by NHS Improvement, so it would be unfair to blame him for its near vacuity but it was the only meaningful stab during his time at addressing a problem that poses a potentially existential threat to the NHS and its much-vaunted long-term plan.Yet the document was, to use a phrase beloved of his new boss, a pile of piffle.\nHis promised green paper on prevention of ill-health, setting out government plans to confront the huge avoidable loss of life from bad diet, smoking and alcohol, was finally published without fanfare \u2013 buried, in effect \u2013 on the gov.uk website on Monday night. Meanwhile, the green paper on social care remains as illusory as ever.\nTech is the only area in which he\u2019s made a mark. His evangelical zeal has forced the NHS to do more to use it to improve care and reduce the workload of hard-pressed staff. But his belief that tech can solve many of the NHS\u2019s difficulties had led to him being derided by people he needs to respect him. Trust bosses have tired of showing Hancock around and explaining a problem, only for him to respond: \u201cThere\u2019s an app that should help fix that.\u201d The NHS England chief executive tapped into that astonishment when, to loud laughter, he asked at a public event last week: \u201cAlexa \u2026 where is Matt Hancock\u2019s social care green paper? There\u2019s no answer.\u201d\nIf Hancock departs the DHSC this week for the bigger job he clearly craves, how will he be remembered? He will be forgotten.", "label": 0}, "text-319": {"text": "Buffalo's ageless Frank Gore: the bell-cow back who's doing the impossible\nA great running back has a career that\u2019s easily reduced to a 10-second highlight. For Cleveland\u2019s Jim Brown, it\u2019s a black-and-white montage of him barreling through wall after wall of humanity to paydirt. For Chicago\u2019s Walter Payton, we smash-cut from Sweetness sloughing off would-be tacklers like George Costanza fleeing a smoking kids\u2019 party to Sweetness dolphin-diving over a stacked front onto a concrete end zone. For Detroit\u2019s Barry Sanders, roll that clip from the 1992 playoffs of him going all Great Tiger on the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys.\nAs for the Buffalo Bills\u2019 Frank Gore? Well, his greatness isn\u2019t easily GIF\u2019d. Look up the five-time Pro Bowler\u2019s highlights on YouTube, and, sure, the hits \u2013 mostly of him jetting through scrums in his younger days and piling up yards after contact now \u2013 aren\u2019t bad. It\u2019s just not the kind of mental time-capsule fodder that autoplays at the very mention of his name.\nNevertheless: all of Gore\u2019s efforts, however pedestrian they might seem in comparison to those monumental rushers, added up to something quite spectacular just the same. With a 65-yard afternoon against Denver on 24 November, Gore slipped past Sanders into third place on the NFL\u2019s all-time rushing list; 26 more yards in Buffalo\u2019s season-finale against the New York Jets last Sunday left Gore with a staggering 15,347 yards for his career, a running total that now only trails those of Payton (16,726) and Cowboys icon Emmitt Smith (18,355). Throw in Gore\u2019s 3,896 yards receiving, and he becomes the only runner other than Payton to amass more than 15,000 yards on the ground and more than 3,500 through the air.\nAll this in what was a down year for the 5ft 9in, 212lb Gore, one that saw him register career lows in total yards (599) and yards per carry (3.6). Still: there\u2019s no doubt his modest contributions and leadership behind the scenes are a big reason why the Bills are back in the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. (And all this after an 18-year drought, once the longest in North American pro sports.) On Saturday they\u2019ll pit their top-10 rushing attack against the Houston Texans\u2019 bottom-10 rush defense and play for a wild-card upset on the road.\nThat Gore should feature prominently in these epic milestones \u2013 and not, say, former Chiefs dynamo Jamaal Charles or former Titans dazzler Chris Johnson or former St. Louis Ram bruiser Steven Jackson \u2013 beggars belief. Consider: this is a 36-year-old dude playing on his third team in five seasons, after spending the first decade of his career in San Francisco. By rights, Gore should be opening up a restaurant or settling into an analyst gig or home getting his college-bound son, Frank Gore Jr, ready for his own running back career instead wintering in Buffalo in preparation for his first playoff appearance in six years.\nWhat\u2019s more, pro football isn\u2019t just a pass-first league now; it\u2019s a pass early and often league. The modern game claims to have no place for a bell-cow back with Gore\u2019s bona fides. And yet this dude abides. With each new handoff, he lowers his shoulders and steams ahead, face mask jutting out like a cowcatcher, yards piling up all the while. His silent protest of the NFL\u2019s pass wacky era alone should mark him as a gridiron wizard. Yet when a jury of football druids compiled a list of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players ever for the occasion of the league\u2019s centennial, Gore\u2019s name was nowhere to be found on a running back roster that included Brown, Payton, Sanders and Smith.\nOn the one hand that figures. Gore has yet to win a Super Bowl, falling a goal line stand short when the Colin Kaepernick-led San Francisco 49ers faced the Baltimore Ravens in 2013 despite rushing for a game-high 110 yards on 19 carries. Gore also has never finished better than third on the single-season rushing yardage list and isn\u2019t likely to improve in that area as opportunities diminish with age. Worst of all, his style is so unassuming. He\u2019s not much of a first-down celebrator or an end-zone dancer. Strip away the stakes, and the carry on which he pipped Sanders \u2013 a fourth-quarter burst through the teeth of the Broncos line that went for seven yards \u2013 becomes about as exciting as the sight of Sanders calmly handing the ball off to an official after one of his unreal touchdown scampers. Call him \u201cFrank Bore\u201d.\nOn the other hand you\u2019d be hard pressed to name a modern tailback who\u2019s proven as durable as Frank the Tank, a workout warrior who has missed only two games since 2011. For any other pro tailback, this would be a remarkable achievement. In Gore\u2019s case, it should never have happened. After all, he grew up poor in Coconut Grove, Florida, sharing a two-bedroom house with nine other relatives \u2013 not least a mother with a grave cocaine addiction. He suffered from a crippling form of dyslexia that nearly kept him out of college. At the University of Miami he was buried on a depth chart that at points featured Clinton Portis, Willis McGahee and Najeh Davenport \u2013 future Sunday stars, all. When Gore finally reached the field, he tore the anterior cruciate ligaments in both his knees.\nFollowing a successful rehab timed to the 2005 NFL draft, Gore saw his slim chance of turning pro narrow yet again after showing up overweight to the scouting combine and posting a six out of 50 on the Wonderlic Test \u2013 a score 14 points below average and four points below the standard for literacy. That was enough for the handful of teams that had kicked the tires on Gore to consider other prospects. Only the 49ers didn\u2019t flinch, selecting Gore at the top of the third round. And he promptly repaid their loyalty by dedicating the next 10 seasons to becoming the best back in the history of that Tiffany franchise. Not even two bum shoulders that would require reconstructive surgery after his rookie season slowed him down.\nGore was no less determined after leaving San Francisco to sign with Indianapolis, or after leaving Indy for Miami three years later. And though he continued to lead those teams in rushing even as his efficiency tapered, Gore failed in his quest to return to the heights he had reached in San Francisco. Last March he started over again in Buffalo, signing a one-year deal for $2m to share a backfield with fellow Pro Bowler LeSean McCoy. Five months later the Bills cut McCoy loose, leaving Gore to serve as a mentor to rookie running back Devin Singletary and second-year quarterback Josh Allen \u2013 a Gore jersey owner in his youth, as it happens. Together, they are the heart of the most rugged playoff offense outside of Nashville and the most exciting Bills offense since Flutiemania. Which is to say: perhaps this right here is the signature Gore highlight we\u2019ve been waiting for.\nAnd while his particular strain of genius might not be so obvious, this much is clear: game recognizes game. After the historic Denver game, Gore was pressed by the Broncos fearsome pass rusher Von Miller for his game-worn jersey and, later, blitzed with video messages from Sanders, Smith and his son among other prominent well-wishers. To a man, they encouraged Gore to keep going \u2013 with McGahee pushing his Miami teammate not to stop until he reaches the top of the all-time rushing list. And, shoot, if Tom Brady can break records in his 40s, there\u2019s little reason to believe Gore can\u2019t as if he stays healthy and keeps having fun, and teams can still find use for him. The only question is whether he can do it in a Buffalo uniform.\nThat said: it\u2019s not a question that the Bills\u2019 table-slamming faithful figure to be asking this week, as they urge Gore on in hopes witnessing the team\u2019s first postseason victory since 1995. Another running back might shudder under that kind of pressure. But, clearly, Gore thrives under pressure. He just has a funny way of showing it.", "label": 0}, "text-320": {"text": "AFP\u2019s failure to investigate Angus Taylor has corrosive consequences for our democracy\nPrecision matters, so let\u2019s be very precise. The Australian federal police has not conducted a deep dive into what went on in Angus Taylor\u2019s office \u2013 how it came to pass that a dodgy document was deployed in a political attack against the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore.\nThe police haven\u2019t investigated. They have declined to investigate.\nAccording to the AFP\u2019s statement issued on Thursday, the New South Wales police handed them \u201cinformation\u201d about the inquiry they had undertaken last year into the controversy. The AFP perused this information and determined \u201cit is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence\u201d.\nNow this is kind of curious, because nobody at any point asked the police to consider whether a commonwealth offence had been committed. The referral was very precise. It asked for an assessment of whether an offence had been committed under NSW law.\nHaving assessed the NSW investigation \u2013 after the NSW police kindly passed the political hot potato on to the constabulary in Canberra \u2013 the AFP determined there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information.\nThis is a relief of course, but it always seemed highly unlikely Taylor himself would have authored a career-ending dodgy document as a bit of comic relief between cabinet submissions.\nSo why is the arbitration narrowed to what the minister did or did not do?\nAlso, it is entirely unclear how this \u201cno evidence\u201d determination was reached. By speaking to Angus Taylor? By looking at electronic records? The AFP has declined to say whether police interviewed the minister, or staff, or others, as part of this process.\nThe AFP has justified its decision not to investigate (again being clear what has actually happened here) because of the \u201clow level of harm\u201d associated with the episode, and because Taylor apologised for using false figures when he accused the council of undertaking travel that wasn\u2019t actually undertaken.\nLet\u2019s pause here a moment and consider \u201clow level of harm\u201d. Now it\u2019s obvious to say harm is an eye-of-the-beholder concept, but it probably pays at this juncture to recap the central facts of this case.\nTo explain the otherwise inexplicable, Taylor has always insisted that his office accessed an early version of the Sydney City Council annual report, and that version contained different travel figures than the report that appears on the website currently.\nTaylor\u2019s problem is there has never been any concrete evidence, at least in the public domain, to substantiate that claim. Now perhaps the police fared better than the rest of us, but the minister never provided any proof to the parliament or to journalists.\nThe City of Sydney for its part produced detailed evidence of its metadata and screenshots from the system used to manage its website. That material showed the publicly available documents had not changed since they were first uploaded \u2013 with the correct and accurate figures \u2013 in November last year.\nThe evidence supplied by the council suggests the document Taylor\u2019s office used wasn\u2019t ever on the council website. So if that\u2019s correct, where did this false document come from? Who authored it? Why did they do that?\nAnd most importantly, why are there no consequences for doing that?\nSticking with the sliding scale of harm, it is true that nobody is ever going to lose any sleep over an issue as micro as the size of the Sydney City Council travel budget, and whether a commonwealth cabinet minister thinks it\u2019s a good use of his time to pick a student politics fight with a local government official.\nBut I suspect a number of us do care if documents have been falsified and whether fake documents are being deployed in public debate.\nThat would seem to me to be quite harmful activity in an age where citizens in democracies don\u2019t know who, or what, to trust in politics and public life, and are suspicious of institutions that once enjoyed significant levels of respect.\nNot being able to determine what\u2019s true, and people not being held accountable when falsehoods happen, is incredibly harmful. It\u2019s more than harmful, actually. Corrosive is a better word.\nIn deciding not to investigate, the AFP also determined that getting to the bottom of the Taylor/Moore imbroglio would require a \u201csignificant\u201d level of resources.\nReally? Would it require more than the small phalanx of police who sifted through the underwear drawer of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst last year after she was raided after publishing information that was clearly in the public interest?\nMore resources than that?\nSeems pretty unlikely, doesn\u2019t it.\nKatharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor", "label": 0}, "text-321": {"text": "UK coronavirus crisis 'to last until spring 2021 and could see 7.9m hospitalised'\nThe coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals.\nThe document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.\nIt also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time.\nProf Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population \u201care expected\u201d to contract the virus.\nThe document says that: \u201cAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.\u201d\nThe briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the public\u2019s health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport.\nIt has been drawn up in recent days by PHE\u2019s emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by Dr Susan Hopkins, PHE\u2019s lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in Engand.\n\u201cFor the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that\u201d, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.\n\u201cA year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn\u2019t well appreciated or understood,\u201d added Hunter, an expert in epidemiology.\n\u201cI think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,\u201d he added.\nThe admission that the virus will continue to cause problems for another year appears to undermine hopes that the arrival of warmer weather this summer would kill it.\nThe document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work \u201cin essential services and critical infrastructure\u201d will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care.\nHowever, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: \u201cIt is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\u201d Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days.\nThe document also states that:\nThe health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are \u201cunder significant demand pressures\u201d.\nFrom now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested.\nTesting services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients.\nA senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing \u201csurge\u201d in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying.\nIf the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths. But if Whitty\u2019s insistence that the rate will be closer to 0.6% proves accurate, then that would involve 318,660 people dying.\nExperts advising governments worldwide on the way epidemics grow and eventually decline say there will be a rapid rise in cases to a peak \u2013 and then a falling off. Whitty, who has seen the modelling done by UK and global scientists, says the case numbers will go up fast over the next 10 to 14 weeks.\nThat will mean a peak at around the end of May to mid-June, when the NHS will be under great pressure. The strategy of all countries is to delay that peak and stretch it out over a longer period of time, so that health services are better able to cope. There is also the possibility that new treatments will be available by then.\nAfter the peak, case numbers and deaths are expected to drop for 10 weeks or more, until they reach a fairly low level, which may not be zero. In the summer months especially, the case numbers are expected to reduce because people spend more time out of doors and are less likely to be confined at close quarters in small rooms in a house or office with people who are infected.\nThere is still a worry that the virus could resurge in the autumn or winter months, which means planning for the long term will be necessary.

The financial crash of 2007-8 seemed to mark the beginning of the most recent crisis of capitalism; 2016 brought news of a crisis of democracy, and the political and constitutional crisis created by Brexit marks its second act. Every day the climate crisis heats up. Crisis has become the new normal.\nIt\u2019s often said that we are also witnessing a crisis of liberalism: liberal norms are being eroded, institutions are under threat, and across Europe, parties of the centre are haemorrhaging votes. Meanwhile, the critics of centrism are louder than they have been for years. Even many in the mainstream of British politics have begun to acknowledge that in the past decade centrists have been neoliberalism\u2019s willing bedfellows, supporting policies to shrink the welfare state and crush unions. Liberal centrism has \u201cleft people behind\u201d, and in its support for free markets and globalisation, created new forms of exclusion. More damning critiques are also gaining currency: that the \u201cliberal\u201d way of running politics was always bound up with imperialism and colonialism, sceptical of democracy and workers and a cover for capitalist exploitation. Even the Financial Times \u2013 the pinnacle of economic liberalism \u2013 recently argued that the capitalist model needs to be \u201creset \u201d.\nSo liberal centrists aren\u2019t wrong that their institutions, parties and ideas are being challenged. But the problem may be a deeper one: that the categories of mainstream politics as we know it can no longer explain the world.\nAs an ideology, liberalism can be hard to pin down. It\u2019s capacious and it has adapted throughout history. From John Locke to John Maynard Keynes, liberals have prioritised the values of liberty and equality (though they\u2019ve disagreed about how much the latter matters to the former and what those values mean in everyday politics). They have supported the rule of law, rights and representation, as well as private property, markets and, for the most part, capitalism against socialism. During the cold war, liberals often defended the status quo, seeing a slide into totalitarianism behind every scheme for political change. There is a long liberal tradition of attacking the left to defend the centre. In the 1980s, a faction of Labour MPs left the party to found the SDP. In the 90s, as New Labour disciplined the party\u2019s left wing, liberalism took the form of the Third Way. Today, many liberal centrists paint Jeremy Corbyn as an extremist on a par with Boris Johnson, and draw false equivalence between left and right.\nAt the end of the 1990s, there was one thing that many liberals shared: an optimism about the direction of history\nYet in many countries, Britain included, liberals also helped to build the welfare state and have used the machinery of central government to enact progressive reforms and benefit the poor \u2013 defending the NHS, civil and human rights, social equality, migration. Often, they aimed not to liberate workers but compromise with them, in order to minimise the risks individuals face. Social liberals have sometimes opposed economic liberals: the concern to limit inequality has trumped the defence of laissez-faire and capital markets. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown enshrined minimum wage laws but encouraged the privatisation of public services; they founded Sure Start but helped sell off the NHS.\nAt the end of the 1990s, there was one thing that many liberals shared: an optimism about the direction of history and about the fate of liberalism. Famously many agreed that history had ended, following the end of the cold war. All that was needed was steady incremental reform of the status quo. These 90s assumptions survived well into the new century. We now know that such declarations were hugely complacent. The biggest mistake of liberalism was thinking it was all over.\nToday, few have properly come to terms with that mistake. Many are on the back foot, insisting that any move away from their ideas marks a step backwards into a far nastier history. Such defensiveness is not novel: liberalism has often been a negative sort of politics \u2013 a politics of second best that protects against worse scenarios. Liberals have been the first to prophesy new end times \u2013 the demise of democracy and the Pax Americana \u2013 and see in Brexit and Trump a slippery slope to war and fascism. Where conservatives look to restore a lost past, liberals defend the gradual reform of an established order and respond aggressively to any threat to it, whether real or imagined.\nAll this worry about values and norms makes it possible to miss the fact that liberalism as an ideology still dominates how we see the world. It does not just occupy a place between left and right; it cuts across both.\nThe liberal worldview frames politics as something that happens mostly in Westminster, and about which most voters care little, so it downplays the politics of everyday life in the home and workplace. On this view, the political realm is inhabited by powerful individuals whose decisions make a difference, and who operate in institutions that are neutral. Values conflict, but compromise is the aim \u2013 except where liberal values are deemed to be threatened; it can sometimes seem that liberals believe in the possibility of consensus, but only if the other side accept the basic facts that liberals hold as true. This can mean touting virtues in principle but refusing them in practice: the Liberal Democrats demanding compromise and cooperation while they reject a Corbyn-led coalition is a case in point.\nFor liberal remainers, Brexit is either a giant misunderstanding or a mistake: it has been brought about by voters\u2019 lack of knowledge, or by party misjudgments and the rightwing media; it has been prolonged by Rasputin-like advisers (whether Dominic Cummings or Seumas Milne). Undoubtedly, centrist thinkers, with their focus on institutions and those who control them, can provide answers to important questions: how the common law relates to the constitution; how EU regulations and the referendum dilute parliamentary sovereignty. At a time when we are meant to have had enough of experts, it is ironic that expert knowledge is in extremely high demand in public institutions \u2013 in the civil service, parliament, the courts, and the press. But it\u2019s easy to mistake symptoms for causes. Though Brexit will surely have disastrous consequences \u2013 hurtling us towards a neoliberal, deregulated and depressed Britain with an empowered right on the rise \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean the liberal diagnosis tells the full story.\nHampered by the need to defend the EU as a site of cosmopolitanism in the name of stopping Brexit, many remainers have framed any opposition as a threat to a political order that has no need for change. The rightward drift of the Lib Dems as they look to rebuild their vote by becoming the party of remain illustrates this bias to the status quo. For all its references to history (particularly to the totalitarian threats of the 1930s), the current liberal vision is often quite ahistorical: we don\u2019t hear much about Britain before the referendum. Even the most radical version of liberal centrism has only a partial diagnosis: it points to rising inequality and a growing generational and educational gap. Liberals may focus on defending norms, but norms themselves are only how particular political settlements are made legitimate. They don\u2019t tell us much about the limits of the settlement itself.\nThe view of Brexit and Trump as a crisis of institutions, norms or civility, and the focus on the narcissism or hubris of political personalities, is too limited. The alternative is not merely to accept the narratives of the right \u2013 that Brexit is about a defence of sovereignty or kicking it to liberal elites. Both of these inhabit the conventional terms of debate. By slipping into a kneejerk defence of the status quo, we risk not understanding where the threats come from and how they can be fought. By focusing on individuals, we ignore how classes are changing. By looking to reason and forgetting ideology, we miss the pleasures of resentment and commitment, and how new political forces have developed to capitalise on those pleasures \u2013 in particular how the Conservative party has reinvigorated itself by building new class alliances and using a heady mix of Thatcherite, nationalist and colonial tropes (a strategy that is haphazard but may well prove successful).\nIf we define politics too narrowly and dwell on historical parallels, we miss our own history and the social and economic changes that have paved the way to where we are now \u2013 a situation where the institutions and infrastructure of British public life are dysfunctional, where productivity, investment and wages are low, where the public sector has been hollowed out and the steady job all but disappeared. If we worry only about the breakdown of parliamentary checks-and-balances, we miss that this gives the lie to the liberal dream that certain institutions are neutral and beyond politics. When we see the rise of the right in terms of a crisis of civility, we fail to ask what resentments the veneer of civility masks, as well as who it benefits and harms. When we focus on constitutional crisis, we risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability \u2013 and that the coming election is also about our prospects for fixing these.\nWe risk forgetting how Brexit manifests deeper disruptions and social instability\nThese alternative diagnoses have major implications. The end of the liberal dream of neutrality opens up a view of the world where politics is found in new places \u2013 the courts, the market, the workplace, the home \u2013 and where political analysts take seriously arguments that have long been made by those outside mainstream politics, who have been marginalised by class, race, gender, geography, immigration status and age. This may be unsettling, but it can point us away from the old divisions of parliament versus the people, so easily deployed by the right and point to new battle lines: not between norms and their violation, or Brexit and its reversal, but to what we want for the future of the UK.\nCrucially, these diagnoses can also show us where the deeper political crisis lies. The lasting damage to Britain may not be caused only by the constitutional chaos, but by the long-term collapse, defunding and decay of our public institutions \u2013 the NHS, legal aid, our underfunded schools. Paradoxically, it was the stability of such institutions that made liberal centrism make sense as a way of thinking about politics. With public institutions dysfunctional and liberal democracy hollowed out, liberalism no longer looks like an ideology that can explain the world: its basis falls away. Liberal political thinking is stuck. It can no longer give a convincing account of politics, except to describe what\u2019s happening as an assault on itself. What would help liberalism make sense again is the rebuilding of those public institutions. It is an irony for liberals that this is precisely what the Labour party today is proposing.\nWhat is needed is a longer and wider view than the liberal vision of politics allows \u2013 one that enables us to see how social, economic and ideological changes intersect with and shape personality and procedure. This is why elements in the press have started to listen to the left once again, discussing \u201cresetting\u201d capitalism in the context of inequality and climate crisis, and engaging with talk of interests, class and ideology that has for so long been labelled as irrelevant. Now liberals also have to choose: to stay where they are and try to squeeze new developments into old paradigms, or to recognise these limits. Instead of a revival of liberalism, we might need a reckoning with it.\n\u2022 Katrina Forrester\u2019s In the Shadow of Justice: Postwar Liberalism and the Remaking of Political Philosophy is published by Princeton.", "label": 0}, "text-324": {"text": "RENEWABLE AND CONVENTIONAL ENERGY GENERATION \u2013 COMPARING THE COSTS\nLink to Full Report:\nProponents of wind and solar electricity generation plants contend that the costs of these plants are now, or soon will be, lower than those of conventional electricity generation plants based on nuclear energy, hydro or the combustion of fossil fuels. Is this true?\nThere are many different cost factors to take into account, including notably the initial capital costs of the plants and their operating, maintenance and repair costs; these ultimately are reflected in the purchasing utility\u2019s total expenditures over the life of the plants and the costs that are passed on to electricity consumers in the form of higher rates. Costs, however, are only one element to consider in determining the economic viability or merits of a plant; others include its capacity utilization (the average power generated as a percentage of the stated capacity, or \u201cnameplate\u201d capacity, of the plant); whether it is \u201cdispatchable\u201d (variable to meet changes in demand) or instead intermittent and unreliable; its ability to supply electricity at peak demand periods when it is most needed; and its effects on the market value (\u201cpool price\u201d) of generation, especially when the electricity generated exceeds the demand\nSince 2000, the actual costs of newly added wind and solar generation have significantly exceeded the costs of other sources of power generation. This is especially evident in Europe, where the capital costs of onshore wind projects per gigawatt (GW) of generation has been 16 times that of natural gas fired generation and that of solar PV on the grid has been 63 times that of natural gas fired generation. By 2014, the countries of the European Union had spent over 1.1 trillion euros (CDN $1.68 trillion) on wind and solar generation. Over the lives of the contracts existing in 2014, the EU countries made some 3.1 trillion euros (CDN $4.74 trillion) in financial commitments. In the province of Ontario, the government\u2019s granting of above-market feed-in-tariffs \u2013 \u201cFIT\u201d (a form of fixed, contracted subsidies) to renewables under 20-year fixed price contracts, with \u201cfirst-to-the-grid\u201d rights, has provided large subsidies valued by different sources from CDN $6.4 billion to $9.2 billion and left the provincial utility with up to $38 billion in long-term unfunded liabilities\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates the levelized capital and operating costs (LCOE) over the lives of new electricity generation plants that will enter service in the near future. The most recent estimates, for plants entering service in 2022, indicate that new natural gas combined cycle and gas advanced combined\u00a0cycle will have the lowest cost (U.S. $57/MWh) among the dispatchable\u00a0sources of generation. Among the non-dispatchable sources of generation,\u00a0the lowest cost sources will be onshore wind ($64/MWh), hydroelectric($66/MWh) and solar PV ($85/MWh).\nOther sources challenge the EIA\u2019s LCOE methodology. Notably, the Institute for Energy Research observed that the EIA ignores the comparison between the cost of new generation and the cost of continuing to operate existing fossil fueled (mainly coal-fired) power plants to the end of their economic lives instead of shutting them down prematurely. It also questions the EIA\u2019s assumptions concerning the utilization rates of renewable energy plants and the prices of natural gas. It estimates the LCOE\u00a0of existing conventional coal plants in 2015 to be U.S. $40/MWh and that\u00a0of gas combined cycle plants to be U.S. $34/MWh.\nThe most fundamental challenges to the EIA findings are from experts who emphasize the differences in the costs and value of intermittent versus dispatchable electricity generating sources. They argue that the LCOE approach is flawed because it treats all megawatt hours supplied as a homogeneous product governed by the law of one price, and thus does not account for the fact that the value (wholesale market price) of electricity supplied varies widely over the course of a typical year. LCOE also ignores the necessary costs of backing up intermittent sources with conventional power (typically natural gas) and the many additional costs of the power grid operator needed to integrate wind and solar, along with the need for additional transmission lines.\nComparing the average household electricity prices in Europe and North America shows clearly that the price of power rises dramatically, as the proportion of photovoltaic and wind capacity per inhabitant rises. Prices in Germany and Denmark are almost three times higher than in the United States.\nThe higher costs quoted for renewable energy do not include most of the taxpayer subsidies provided to renewables.\nIf, as proponents of wind and solar claim, the economic costs of renewable energy generation will soon be less than those of conventional sources, they should have no objection if governments eliminate the present subsidies, above-market tariffs and portfolio mandates establishing minimum utility purchase requirements. It is telling that none of these advocates is proposing this in any jurisdiction.", "label": 1}, "text-325": {"text": "Sports quiz of the week: El Cl\u00e1sico, Harvard, FA Cup and tennis turf", "label": 0}, "text-326": {"text": "NFL players agree to new deal, opening way for 17-game season\nNFL players have come to an agreement with the league over a new collective bargaining agreement, which opens the way for an increase in salaries while also ushering in a 17-game season.\nThe new agreement will run until 2030.

The new farms, which would provide electricity for 57m homes, were needed because the construction of new turbines by the private sector was too slow, despite falling costs, she said. The profits from the power generation would be reinvested to benefit coastal communities and tackle the climate emergency.\nPublic ownership would ensure jobs and revenue stayed in the UK, she added. \u201c[We can] learn from countries such as Norway and Sweden by owning what is already ours,\u201d she said. \u201cBy taking a stake in offshore wind, we can collectively benefit from the profits, investing them back in our held-back coastal communities. Instead of jackets for windfarms in Scotland being made in Indonesia, we\u2019ll bring those jobs back to Fife.\u201d\nLabour would invest \u00a36.2bn from its proposed \u00a3250bn national transformation fund in the new windfarms, along with a matching amount from the regional energy agencies which would replace the renationalised National Grid. The remaining \u00a370bn would be sought from private sector investors, and the new windfarms would be 51% owned by the public.\nA projected \u00a3600m to \u00a31bn a year in profits would go to coastal communities for amenities such as harbour fronts, parks, leisure centres and libraries, with the remainder invested in improvements to the energy system and measures to combat global heating.\nOther \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d proposals include a \u00a33.6bn national network of electric vehicle charging stations, solar panels for low-income and social housing tenants, and a programme of insulation for fuel-poor households.\nSue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at the Prospect union, said: \u201cThis focus on how to drive up low-carbon generation while lowering costs and encouraging quality unionised UK jobs is welcome.

As you do.\nThe prime minister\u2019s office was a redirection service, periodically passing on the hopes and dreams of colleagues, and their plucky sports clubs, to Bridget, so Bridget could decide, because she was the decider.\nBut the facts tell a different story.\nThe ANAO has revealed that between 17 October 2018 and 11 April 2019 McKenzie and Morrison\u2019s office exchanged 136 emails about the program. Now perhaps this level of traffic is consistent in some universe with hands-off caring and sharing, but, objectively, this is quite a lot of caring and sharing.\nIt suggests more than a passing interest. It suggests active coordination.\nThen we have the inconvenience of records in the hands of the auditor indicating the prime minister\u2019s office actually made things happen. I\u2019ll let Brian Boyd from the ANAO take up the story.\nBoyd told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday night McKenzie \u201cmaintained the spreadsheet at all times\u201d, but there was a lot of incoming. Sometimes, Boyd said, the prime minister\u2019s office made representations, \u201cbut not all of those representations led to a change\u201d.\nBut at other times those \u201crepresentations\u201d led to concrete outcomes. \u201cFor example, when I referred to one project coming out and one project coming in, in terms of the 8.46am version, that was at the request of the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d.\nLet\u2019s repeat that last bit. At the request of the prime minister\u2019s office. Translation: pull this, and insert that, hey presto!\nObviously this is more than representations, take it or leave it.\nIt is curious if you are Scott Morrison and you choose to reveal the first, the representations, while omitting the second, the outcomes you engineer, when the second component is actually more material.\nMorrison\u2019s whole purpose in constructing his \u201cwe were just the freight-forwarders\u201d defence is that he and his office were hands off, that this was all Bridget. Let\u2019s call this strategy what it is: inoculation. Fire wall construction.\nThe trouble for Morrison is every new piece of evidence that emerges tells us this wasn\u2019t all Bridget. This wasn\u2019t even close to being all Bridget. But only Bridget has lost her frontbench spot, and that was on a technicality.\nIt\u2019s a strange sort of universe where there is a clear documentary trail suggestive of significant alternative facts, but only Bridget faces practical consequences for suboptimal actions, and everyone else gets a self-conferred free pass.\nAnd when I say strange, I mean unfair. I mean wrong. I mean not even close to good enough.\nAs well as consequences for actions apparently being arbitrary, the sports grants controversy has also unearthed cameos suggestive of a government that is entirely fast and loose with process and convention.\nFrom where I sit, this is deeply worrying. The most worrying thing about it is the complete absence of contrition, and the recurrent tetchy suggestions from Morrison that anyone who dares to call out the fast and loose tendencies is a nit-picker, or a partisan, or a bubble occupant.\nA bit like when the prime minister tried to brush off inconvenient questions about whether he tried to get the Hillsong pastor Brian Houston along to a state dinner at the White House as \u201cgossip\u201d and a bubble fixation, before abruptly confirming this had been true all along. Disconcerting \u2013 the short runway between gossip and fact.\nThis column isn\u2019t a piece of advocacy for McKenzie. I\u2019m quite certain she can look after herself.\nI recount these facts to make another point, and the point is about trust. Trust matters. Trust is the glue that holds democracies together.\nMorrison asks for trust every day that he stands up and speaks to the nation about managing the coronavirus.\nThe prime minister asks to be believed. He asks people to listen, to follow advice. Implicit in this pitch is words, advice, pronouncements, from the holder of his high office, carry meaning, and they are consistent with facts and evidence.\nBeing believed, being trusted, is an antidote to pervasive disinformation, and cheap jack demagoguery. It is, in fact, the best antidote we have to these things.\nBut \u201ctrust me, I\u2019m the prime minister\u201d doesn\u2019t work if you then behave in a manner entirely inconsistent with your own request.\nSo here\u2019s the rub, prime minister.

However, outrage sparked by Nazi slogans, death threats and the recent deadly attack on a synagogue may have dampened expectations of the party seizing control from the embattled left.\nIn what has been billed as a fight for the political heart of Germany, the anti-immigration, anti-establishment AfD, which made strong gains in the states of Saxony and Brandenburg last month, was expected to take around 23%, according to final polling, more than double its previous result of 10.6% in the east-central state.\nIt is vying for second place with the Christian Democrats (CDU) of Angela Merkel, which was on on 22.9% in final polls.\nDie Linke, which under its popular leader, Bodo Ramelow, has led Thuringia in a coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens since 2014, is widely expected to win with around 30%, but is likely to struggle to form a majority government.\nThe AfD framed its campaign from the start as a cultural clash with the established parties. It has accused those in power of failing to deliver on the promises made since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago to citizens of the former communist east, including 2 million Thuringians.\n\u201cWe have been left behind,\u201d said Astrid, a care worker from M\u00fchlhausen, using a phrase that has come to define supporters of the AfD in recent elections: \u201cabgeh\u00e4ngt\u201d, literally \u201chung up\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d.\nThe 59-year-old, who did not want to give her surname, said she had voted for Die Linke at the last poll but was now considering supporting the AfD.\nJohannes Br\u00fcns, the mayor of M\u00fchlhausen, said the city of 36,000 had much to be proud of: Johann Sebastian Bach was once the resident organist, it boasts one of Germany\u2019s largest medieval centres and is the birthplace of John A Roebling, the civil engineer behind New York\u2019s Brooklyn Bridge.\n\u201cIt has a lot going for it,\u201d Br\u00fcns said. \u201cBut the people here have had a tough time having to reorientate themselves. Nineteen out of 20 eastern Germans had to find new jobs after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Some left and succeeded, some stayed and succeeded, but some got left behind and the insecurities have remained. There is a considerable amount of frustration.\u201d\nThe town prospered over centuries thanks to its expansive textile industry. But much of that was closed by the Treuhand, the agency tasked with restructuring and selling state-owned businesses in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) before unification in October 1990. Often that involved buying up the competition, making use of the know-how before liquidating the companies.\n\u201cResentment about that sits deep to this day,\u201d Br\u00fcns said. Resentment which, he added, was only reinforced by issues such as pensions being lower than those in the west and more recently, the refugee crisis.\n\u201cThe most frequent comment I hear from the 50-plus is: \u2018There\u2019s little recognition for what we\u2019ve achieved in our lives, but the government doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to helping refugees.\u2019\u201d\nThe AfD\u2019s success \u2013 polls repeatedly show it has the support of around a quarter of voters in Thuringia \u2013 was the direct consequence of such neglect, he believed.\nTorben Braga, an AfD candidate, made no bones about the fact his party was busy tapping into that emotion with its election slogan, \u201cVollende die Wende\u201d (Complete the transition), a reference to the switch from communism to liberal democracy, which is widely interpreted as an invitation by the party to overturn the status quo, just as protesters who brought down the East German regime did.\n\u201cThis is an election and elections are all about speaking to people\u2019s emotions,\u201d said Braga. \u201cThirty years after the peaceful revolution of 1989, there are still serious differences between east and west, including the level of wages, the infrastructure, and employment figures. There are still no Dax-registered companies from eastern Germany; there is huge emigration from east to west. This bothers people a great deal and the AfD has managed to effectively instrumentalise these emotions for its own gain.\u201d\nSteffen Thormann, 25, a political science student and a candidate for Die Linke in his native M\u00fchlhausen, said he had grown up surrounded by people harbouring such frustrations. \u201cThe Berlin Wall still exists in many people\u2019s heads, even those of my age who weren\u2019t born when it fell,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people are disappointed that, for them, life didn\u2019t improve after reunification in the way they had hoped. The AfD has been very successful at fuelling the envy, but Die Linke has constantly tried to win people\u2019s trust with its solid social policy, including putting more money into schools and kindergartens.\u201d\nAstrid, who was walking her dog on the main square waiting for an AfD election rally to start, said she had been \u201can excited 29-year-old\u201d when the wall came down.\n\u201cWhen the factory I worked in was closed down, I retrained as a care worker,\u201d she said. \u201cI got to know west Germans, I was open to everything.\u201d Now, she said, she struggled to pay her rent, and worried how she would make ends meet on her pension.\nThe arrival of hundreds of refugees in M\u00fchlhausen in 2015 had felt like a further threat to her existence, she said. \u201cThose in power cut the numbers of police and said they didn\u2019t have the funds to fix the holes in the road, but suddenly money was found to house the newcomers.\u201d\nAstrid was waiting to hear Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the AfD\u2019s leading candidate and head of its extremist wing who many say is radicalising the party.\nH\u00f6cke condemned an attack earlier this month on a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle carried out by a lone gunman, but was accused of helping stoke the hatred with his anti-Jewish rhetoric. He has called for a \u201c180-degree shift\u201d in Germany\u2019s remembrance culture of its Nazi past and has labelled the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d. When a state broadcaster suggested to him recently it was hard to decipher between some of his statements and those of Adolf Hitler, H\u00f6cke angrily walked out and said he was being portrayed as \u201cthe nation\u2019s devil\u201d.\nMike M\u00f6hring, the CDU\u2019s main candidate who has received death threats from neo-Nazis during the campaign, has called H\u00f6cke \u201ca Nazi\u201d and his and the other parties have refused to enter a coalition with the AfD.\nThe result in Sunday\u2019s election is unlikely to cause any major upsets in Berlin, but it is being watched closely, not least as a gauge of the AfD\u2019s standing.\n\u201cI am undecided,\u201d said Astrid. \u201cI am angry, but I have no desire to be associated with Nazis.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-334": {"text": "Labour needs to change \u2013 but it mustn\u2019t forget what it got right\nThe Labour party is reeling from a devastating election defeat in which many of its traditional voters turned their backs on the party. If it is to rebound, Labour must take the time to understand what went wrong. And its analysis must go beyond the defenders of Jeremy Corbyn arguing that it was solely down to Brexit, and his detractors pinning all the blame on the leader and \u201cCorbynism\u201d.\nIt is also likely that the election result reflects a much longer and deeper trend, in which the party has lost the trust of communities it has long represented yet who have now lost faith in the political system to change their lives for the better.\nWithout a radical policy platform Labour stands no chance of winning back voters\nWhatever the final verdict, the Labour party will have to change if it is to reconnect with the broad coalition of voters it needs to win back power. But as it does this, it must not lose sight of the one thing it got right in this election. Labour was right to grasp the scale of the economic and environmental challenge the country faces and offer ambitious solutions. Against the backdrop of the longest squeeze in living standards for generations, economic growth that has passed many communities by, entrenched poverty and a climate emergency, Labour offered a manifesto that began to rise to the challenge. It contained flaws, but it would have undoubtedly begun the process of transforming our economy. Those eager to reject Corbyn would be wrong to abandon this ground as well.\nBut Labour must learn from this election. Policies that all the polling indicates are individually popular with voters simply did not cut through: 64% of people support significant increase in public spending to invest in the green economy; 66% believe companies should be required to share their profits with employees; and 61% believe that austerity has damaged vital public services. The manifesto should have resonated with many voters and yet it didn\u2019t.\nIn part, this was because an ambitious reform agenda was presented as a collection of giveaways that felt too good to be true. A 10-year economic agenda was shoehorned into a five-year programme for government and voters rightly questioned whether it could all be delivered. There was no attempt to prioritise or highlight key policies. And not enough groundwork was done in advance of the campaign to convince the public that this scale of change was not only desirable but deliverable. \nCritically, too much of the change that Labour sought to achieve was top-down. Rather than pushing power out to communities, it sought change through an expanded national state with regional offices. The absence of a radical agenda on devolution was a striking omission in the manifesto. An ambition to democratise the economy too often boiled down to state ownership through renationalisation. For communities distrustful of promises from Westminster, Labour failed to tell the story of how it could deliver radical change by giving them more power and control.\nAs Labour dissects what went wrong, the factions defending and attacking Corbyn must learn these lessons and build from here. Abandoning Labour\u2019s entire policy programme \u2013 as some of those who reject Corbyn wish to \u2013 and replacing it with an agenda that seeks incremental changes to the status quo would be a big mistake. There is clear political consensus that for too many people the economy just isn\u2019t working, and also that the threat of the climate crisis is real and imminent.\nFuture elections will be fought and won on who has the answers to these seismic issues. Without a radical policy platform Labour stands no chance of winning back voters who despair of a system that is failing. But Labour\u2019s response must be rooted in the people whose lives it seeks to change.\nThe next election will be fought after we have left the European Union and the promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d has inevitably but tragically failed to deliver the positive change those who voted for it want. All the issues that are bubbling underneath the Brexit vote will have punched through the surface \u2013 as will the anger and frustration of millions who will feel let down. If Labour can go into that election having done the groundwork, and with a manifesto that offers real change, it may just find a route back to power. \n\u2022 Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation", "label": 0}, "text-335": {"text": "The Guardian view on the BBC: watch closely \u2013 change is coming\nAs the current BBC charter agreement still has eight years to run, the culture secretary\u2019s remarks about the future of the licence fee should not be blown out of proportion \u2013 particularly as they came on a day when ministers may have been keen to shift attention away from the decision to scrap an age verification system for online pornography. Responding to a question from a Conservative MP, Nicky Morgan said on Wednesday that she is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the subject of how the corporation should be funded in future, and will listen to arguments from all sides. A policy of switching to a Netflix-style voluntary subscription service is unlikely to form part of the Conservatives\u2019 next general election manifesto, since the royal charter guarantees the licence fee\u2019s maintenance until 2027.\nBut the BBC\u2019s longer-term future nonetheless deserves attention. The \u201chealth check\u201d due to be carried out partway through the current 11-year deal could provide an opportunity for ministerial intervention, although the licence fee falls outside that review\u2019s scope. The transformation of the global media landscape by streaming services makes the compulsory \u00a3154.50 charge harder to justify than it was when the BBC dominated the UK\u2019s television landscape (20 years ago BBC1 and BBC2 between them had an almost 40% share of TV audiences; last year they had only 27%). So does the corporation\u2019s continuing struggle, shared by other traditional broadcasters, to engage younger and more ethnically diverse audiences. Policymakers, organisations with an interest in UK media and culture, and above all the BBC itself, must use this time to explore and reflect on options and possibilities.\nLast month Mark Thompson, the BBC\u2019s former director-general, gave a speech arguing that commercial and technological innovation by the BBC has been stymied by a combination of hostile politicians, rightwing competitors and an outdated regulatory framework. As an example, he cited a 2009 decision to block plans for a joint streaming service by the UK\u2019s terrestrial broadcasters (a commercial service, Britbox, launched in the US and Canada in 2017 and will launch in the UK at the end of this year). Constraints have been imposed on the corporation to protect domestic rivals. But unless it is liberated from some of those, Mr Thompson argued, the BBC risks being squashed by the US giants Netflix and Amazon. Opportunities for British talent and inward investment could easily morph into a brain drain.\nDo the US streaming giants pose a threat not only to British broadcasters and businesses, but to the UK\u2019s distinctive televisual heritage and style? Because the UK and US share a language, the UK is arguably more susceptible than other countries to being swept off its feet by the sheer force of American digital innovation. Along with the NHS and the monarchy, the BBC is often cited as a key ingredient in the glue that sticks the four nations of the UK together. But even if it has played that part in the past, does that mean the corporation should seek to reinvent itself with a view to consolidating its role in domestic life and perhaps even extending its reach abroad?\nWhatever the deliberations about the BBC\u2019s future, it must not be treated in isolation. The corporation is part of a wider media landscape, and its \u00a33.7bn in licence fee income brings obligations not only to the public but to the other media and news organisations, including regional and local ones, who are also contending with the effects of digital disruption. There is a role for a 21st-century national broadcaster. But it will be a different role from the one it played in the past.", "label": 0}, "text-336": {"text": "Sports quiz of the week: generosity, injury, thuggery and history", "label": 0}, "text-337": {"text": "Climate change denial was defeated in 2019. But what comes next won't be easierg\nWill 2019 be remembered as the year in which climate change denial was defeated? The global climate strike, Greta Thunberg\u2019s meteoric rise to international prominence, as well as several high-profile international conferences and reports \u2013 all contributed in putting climate skeptics on the back foot.\nEven Donald Trump, who previously claimed that the climate crisis was a \u201choax\u201d invented by China to hold back American industry, has recently begun to brag about all his administration has done to address it. Following suit, the rest of his party is scrambling to develop a coherent environmental platform, more in line with their electoral base\u2019s shifting views.\nBut the next steps in the global fight against the climate crisis remain far from clear. In the speech she delivered to US Congress in September, Thunberg maintained: \u201cNo matter how political the background to this crisis may be, we must not allow it to become a partisan political question. The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics. And our main enemy right now is not our political opponents. Our main enemy is physics.\u201d\nWhile Thunberg\u2019s intention was evidently to preserve the environmental movement\u2019s unity and common resolve, this may paradoxically soon start to look like a new form of climate denial. As the issue rises to the top of everyone\u2019s agenda, several difficult questions which were previously kept in the background \u2013 or indeed actively suppressed \u2013 by the environmental movement are becoming impossible to ignore.\nThe environmental movement is going to have to become more, not less, politicized, to keep up the momentum\nFor one, no one seems quite clear what is the ultimate goal of the global fight against the climate crisis. Is it merely to enable constant economic growth in a sustainable way, or is it about imposing limits on humanity\u2019s ambitions, in pursuit of a more harmonious relationship with nature?\nEven assuming that question can be settled, it remains to be determined what is the relationship \u2013 and whether there are any tradeoffs \u2013 between environmentalism\u2019s overarching goal(s) and other potentially desirable ends, such as personal freedom, distributive justice and respect for established traditions and ways of life.\nThen there is the issue of means. Whether humanity chooses to fight the climate crisis through centralized, state-based efforts, decentralized market mechanisms, or individual and community-level changes in lifestyle has profound political and distributional consequences. So, it matters what decisions are made in this respect.\nFinally, even the relevant temporal horizon remains open to disagreement. Should we care about what happens in 10,000 years? A few generations? Or the immediate 20 years?\nFar from having straightforward answers, all these questions are inherently political, since they point to deep conflicts in values and interests. They delineate the contours of a new \u201cpolitics of environmentalism\u201d that is beginning to take shape as climate change rises to the top of humanity\u2019s present concerns.\nWe already see this new politics taking shape in emergent debates over competing proposals for addressing the climate crisis. Bernie Sanders\u2019 and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\u2019s respective versions of the Green New Deal are very different from the proposal for a European Green Deal recently put forward by the new president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\nThe first approach wants to connect the issue of the climate crisis with social justice, and advocates for a massive expansion in the role of the state to manage the transition to renewable energy. The second approach treats the issue of the climate crisis in isolation from other social and political issues, and proposes market rather than state mechanisms to address it.\nNor are these the only two options on the table. Another prominent strand of contemporary environmentalism is the one heralded by Pope Francis in the 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si, which folds the struggle against the climate crisis into a broader critique of the \u201cmodern myth of unlimited material progress\u201d on the basis of a religiously inspired conception of the inherent rights of the \u201cnatural order\u201d.\nWhile this chimes with radical ecology\u2019s longstanding commitment to the idea of \u201cde-growth\u201d, it is also compatible with classical conservatism\u2019s critique of modernity, which has traditionally stigmatized the hubris in humanity\u2019s dream of complete domination over nature. Several ideas contained in the pope\u2019s encyclical have in fact been taken up by more conservatively minded political and religious organizations, in an attempt to give greater resonance to the conceptual affinity between political conservatism and natural conservation.\nEven some strands of the nativist far right have begun to develop their own brand of environmentalism. The French Rassemblement National\u2019s leader, Marine Le Pen, has sought to connect the problem of environmental degradation with her party\u2019s broader opposition to globalization and immigration. This translates into a form of \u201cgreen nationalism\u201d focused on the protection of local cultures, products and traditions.\nThis growing diversification of environmental positions is a sign that the movement as a whole is maturing. Environmentalists of all stripes are realizing that there remain important political decisions to be made even after climate crisis denial has been defeated.\nThese decisions cannot be taken by purely technical or scientific means. On the contrary, the fact that the environmental movement has so far remained the preserve of a small technocratic elite has done more to invite populist backlashes than to further its own goals.\nIt is a good thing that all the available options are now being laid bare, in order to better assess their relative merits in an open and democratic way. Whether we like it or not, the environmental movement is going to have to become more, not less, politicized, to keep up the momentum it has acquired so far.\nCarlo Invernizzi-Accetti is associate professor of political science at the City University of New York \u2013 City College", "label": 0}, "text-338": {"text": "climate alarmists' emperor has no clothes\nDr Ed Berry writes: \"IPCC\u2019s claim that human emissions caused all the rise in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 is, without question, the most costly deception in the history of mankind.

This is despite the recent closure of several facilities and a condemnation of abusive facilities from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s office.\nLast week, an Islamic rehabilitation centre with 259 patients in the southwestern city of Ibadan was shut down and its owner arrested. Buhari\u2019s office said in a statement in October that Nigeria would not \u201ctolerate the existence of the torture chambers and physical abuses of inmates in the name of rehabilitation.\u201d\nBut HRW\u2019s report shows that such interventions have fallen short of addressing a problem that is widespread across Nigeria. Stigma and misconceptions, including beliefs that mental health conditions are caused by evil spirits or demons, mean that patients are often detained, abused and forced to \u201csleep, eat and defecate within the same confined space\u201d, often in front of others, HRW said.\nThere are less than 300 psychiatrists in a population of over 200 million, most of whom cannot afford mental health care. This drives many to traditional religious healing centres, where prayer and herbal treatments are prescribed.\n\u201cPeople spend years in institutions \u2013 sometimes decades \u2013 because Nigeria lacks adequate services to support them in the community,\u201d according to the report.\nPatients in some Christian facilities, HRW said, are forced to fast for up to three days as a form of religious treatment. Some Islamic centres are found to have employed whipping.\nHRW said it witnessed dozens of men and women chained in state-run facilities in northern Nigeria and said \u201cmost had lived there for years, some for up to 15 years.\u201d\nChaining was practiced across all but one of 28 facilities visited by HRW researchers. \u201cTypically staff fasten a chain to either both or one ankle of a person and connect it to a heavy or immovable object, such as a bed, tree, or car engine.

The change is expected to affect 128 of the state\u2019s polling locations for its 17 March primary, and local officials are identifying alternative sites. Election officials in Chicago, also holding its primary next week, announced the city was relocating polling stations out of nursing homes.\nIt\u2019s not just voters, however, who are at risk. In 2016, about 56% of poll workers across the country were over 61 years old, according to the US Election Assistance Commission, which collected data from about half of the workers that year. Tammy Patrick, a former election official in Arizona, said administrators should consider hiring youth poll workers and overstaff to prepare for cancellations.\nThe county clerk in Travis county, Texas, said election day last week got off to a \u201crocky start\u201d with long lines at the polls, in part because poll workers didn\u2019t show up for work in an attempt to avoid exposure to coronavirus. Reductions in public transit and dial-a-ride services could also create additional obstacles to people getting to the polls, said Patrick.\nElection officials are urging voters to take their own preventive measures, encouraging voters to cast their ballots early and by mail, providing hand sanitizer at the polls, and sanitizing voting machines and other equipment. Kim Wyman, Washington\u2019s secretary of state, asked voters to use a wet sponge or cloth to seal their mail-in ballots instead of licking them. Election workers are also using gloves to handle the ballots, she told Axios.\nIn places where there are new changes going into effect, officials are scrambling to notify people they may have to cast a ballot at a new location. In Franklin county, Ohio, the county board of elections plans to send mailers to 21,000 voters notifying them of the 16 new polling locations, and post signage at the closed locations with directions to the new ones.\nThat might not be enough, said Mike Brickner, the director of the Ohio chapter of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. \u201cObviously this is pretty short notice and voters may not know that their polling location has moved and may not get that postcard in the mail, or see it, or read it,\u201d he said. He urged election officials to go the \u201cextra mile\u201d and said his group plans to text voters affected by the change.Anticipating a last-minute influx of absentee ballot requests, Ohio\u2019s LaRose also instructed local boards of election to allow people to drop off their absentee ballots in person on election day until 7.30pm, when the polls close.\nCoronavirus concerns, and the adapted measures, compound the existing challenges of the 2020 election, including unprecedented turnout, ageing voting equipment and cybersecurity threats. \u201cMost administrators already don\u2019t have sufficient resources (people and money). The uncertainty makes it even harder,\u201d said Trey Grayson, the former secretary of state of Kentucky.\nWith three months of primary elections taking place across the country, election administrators are trying to reallocate resources at the last minute, Grayson said. \u201cYou could have too few opportunities for early voting, or not enough folks lined up to count mail ballots, or too many people at the polls on election day. Or the reverse if this thing doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless, planning is hard.\u201d\nForty-five states have provisions that allow for changes to elections in case of emergency, though the procedures vary widely from state to state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

But organising the 2019 Central American Cricket Championships has not been without its challenges \u2013 Mexico may be home to 132 million people but the country boasts no more cricket infrastructure than you would find in the average Shropshire village.\n\u201cWe only have one proper cricket pitch in the country and two nets,\u201d says Craig White, the secretary of the Mexico Cricket Association. \u201cWe have a challenge just finding the space to play cricket. You need at least two side-by-side football pitches and it\u2019s hard to find that kind of space for cricket in Mexico.\u201d\nBut space has been found for the seventh edition of El Campeonato Centroamericano de Cricket (or CAC). Squeezed in between two football pitches at the Reforma Athletic Club in Naucalpan on the outskirts of Mexico City lies Mexico\u2019s only turf pitch. At more than 2,500m above sea level it\u2019s the second highest in the world (there is apparently a track in north India about 200m higher) and bowlers from Costa Rica, Panama, Belize and an MCC side will enjoy the extra pace the thin air allows when the tournament gets under way on Thursday.\nThe MCC won the last edition, held in Belize in 2017, while Mexico have triumphed on the two previous occasions they hosted the tournament. (Geography pedants spluttering with outrage at Mexico\u2019s presence in a \u201cCentral American\u201d tournament might also like to know that they also held off Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay to win the South American Championships last year. And then go for a lie down.) For the first time the matches, other than those featuring the MCC, will be full Twenty20 internationals and, in another first, there is a women\u2019s competition featuring Mexico and Costa Rica running alongside the men\u2019s version.\nAs much as crowning a regional champion, the aim of the tournament is to increase awareness of the game in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s not visible here, nobody knows what it is,\u201d says White. \u201cPeople get it confused with the game from Alice in Wonderland. \u2018Croquet?\u2019 Even though cricket is one of the oldest of modern sports in Mexico \u2013 the first recorded game here was in 1827, decades before baseball or football or boxing.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s got a very long history. The challenge is that nobody knows what cricket is. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to change, to make it more visible.\u201d\nIt was visible once, none more so than in the late 1800s when British companies and their workers arriving in the country looking for a new life and a new wage brought their old bats with them. Several Mexican football clubs were formed as cricket clubs \u2013 the six-time Liga MX champions Pachuca, for example, can trace their origins back to the 19th-century cricket clubs of the region. In 1865 the Emperor of Mexico, Maximilian I, played in a game in Mexico City. There\u2019s a longer history than you might think.\nAnd the relationship between cricket and Mexico doesn\u2019t end with the Industrial Revolution. The track at the Reforma Athletic Club was installed in the 1960s. Fred Trueman played on it for a touring British Airways side in the 1970s (Lincoln Clarke, playing for the home side, edged a hook for four through the slips: \u201cWhat kind of a bloody shot is that?\u201d came the growl from the bowler\u2019s end, Trueman clearly having lost none of his fire despite being well into his 40s). And in 1985 an England football squad featuring Gary Lineker, John Barnes and others dropped in for a quick game during a 1985 tour of the country in advance of the World Cup the following year.\nAs you might expect, despite that long and rich history the current Mexico men\u2019s side is made up of expats, as are the squads of the other nations arriving on Wednesday for the tournament. But while the women\u2019s sides might be a little behind in terms of numbers \u2013 with only two countries represented rather than four \u2013 they are ahead in terms of local representation. Both the Mexico squad and the Costa Rica team are predominantly filled with homegrown talent.\nSo there is hope for growth. And for the hosts hope of a third success on home soil, a first men\u2019s and women\u2019s double and perhaps a few more players coming through the local ranks. \u201cBaseball is the second most popular sport in Mexico \u2013 there\u2019s no reason why cricket can\u2019t also be popular given the similarities,\u201d says White. \u201cWe want to make the tournament a festival of cricket and use it as a springboard.\u201d\n\u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

It will also oversee next year\u2019s international conference on the climate crisis (COP 26) \u2013 the most important since the Paris Accord of 2015. We owe it to ourselves and to the world to make sure that climate is not a marginal issue at the election, whenever it comes.\nYet maybe we don\u2019t need to worry. We have largely enjoyed a broad \u201cclimate consensus\u201d in this country: we believe in the science, most of us don\u2019t indulge climate change deniers and there is agreement on the need to act. Not for us on this issue \u2013 at least so far \u2013 the culture wars of the US.\nThere is a real danger that this sense of consensus creates complacency\nBut not so fast. There is a real danger that this sense of consensus creates complacency. Of course we should value the fact that both major parties agree on the need to tackle the emergency. We should be pleased that the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was passed without opposition in the House of Commons, and that the Climate Change Act of 2008 passed by a massive majority. We should not create divisions where they do not exist \u2013 goodness knows we are a divided enough country as it is.\nYet for all our relative progress as a country, no country, including us, is doing enough to meet the Paris goal, which commits us to efforts to keep warming to 1.5C or below, and no more than 2C. The UK is off track for our targets for the late 2020s and 2030s, and outside the power sector, progress has stalled. We are consumed by Brexit, when next year we will need to strain every sinew and use every resource at our disposal to get 190 countries to agree to toughen their targets so we can get closer to having a chance of meeting the Paris goals.\nEvery party and every candidate should therefore be asked where they stand on the key questions that face us \u2013 not just on warm words and good intentions but on the actions they are willing to take and support. What is your vision for tackling the climate emergency? Are you willing to be consistent in the decisions you take so climate is not simply an add-on? Are you willing to commit to the urgency required?\nOn vision, it is obvious to me \u2013 and I believe to the Labour party \u2013 where we need to go. As I have written before, avoiding the nightmare only takes us so far. We need to spell out the dream, encapsulated in the phrase the Green New Deal \u2013 so we meet concerns about economic justice and the climate emergency together. That\u2019s about creating millions of jobs as we change the way we power our country, heat our homes and travel around. We also need to redesign our towns and cities and rethink the way we use our land, improving quality of life as we do. Every party should be tested on its plan to meet this vision, or an alternative, and how they will pay for it in a way that is fair.\nNext comes the need for consistency of purpose and singularity of focus on this issue. It is no longer enough to have some \u201cgreen policies\u201d. In a world where we move to zero carbon, every policy must be green. Of course there is a transition, and the transition must be fair for the workers affected, but there must be a framework that doesn\u2019t simply ignore the problem. For instance, going ahead with the third runway at Heathrow without any sense of how that is consistent with this framework will undermine the public\u2019s trust that we are serious.\nFinally, there is the issue of urgency. Labour\u2019s conference decision to aim for net zero by 2030 is controversial. With today\u2019s politics and the challenges of transition we face, it feels like a moonshot. But Apollo-level ambition, imagination and determination is exactly what we need.\nThere is reason to hope that we can achieve more than looks possible at present. Climate \u201ctipping points\u201d are generally about uncontrollable negative feedback loops. But there are positive tipping points, too. We have seen this with the costs of solar and wind tumbling far faster than anyone forecast, driving much higher take-up than anyone expected. After initial support by government, these technologies now make an unanswerable economic case on their own merits.\nWhatever the level of reductions by 2030 to which different parties commit, we need a totally different level of commitment by government not for 2050 but for the next decade. It is now five months since parliament passed the climate emergency motion, and apart from the net zero target for 30 years\u2019 time, government has done nothing to show it gets what an emergency means.\nIf an election comes soon, Brexit will be the dominant issue. But the climate emergency matters even more to the long-term future of the country. That future depends on decisions made in the next five years. Consensus on the need to act matters. But to save the planet, we need an arms race on speed, scale and urgency.\n\u2022 Ed Miliband is MP for Doncaster North and a former climate change secretary", "label": 0}, "text-344": {"text": "Will a California bill give players a slice of college sports' $14bn pie?\nThis week LeBron James, Bernie Sanders and countless other heavy hitters lent their support to a monumental bill in California that, if passed, could forever alter the business of collegiate athletics and the entire American sports landscape. SB 206 (also known as the Fair Pay to Play Act) would permit collegiate athletes in the state, which include schools like USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford, to seek payment for use of their name, image or likeness.\nThe NCAA, the governing body for college sports in America, has long prohibited its student-athletes from earning any semblance of profit associated with their skill set or name cache. Meanwhile college sports are a $14bn industry, and the NCAA reported a staggering $1.1bn in revenue generated last year, thanks in large part to the unpaid labor of its athletes.\nThe California state assembly this week voted unanimously in favor of the bill. It is expected to overwhelmingly pass in the California state senate soon, and then will land on the desk of California governor Gavin Newsom, who will have 30 days to sign or veto the bill.\nFair Pay to Play does not require schools to alter their methods of recruiting or increase their scholarships minimums. It simply allows athletes to earn spending money in a multitude of currently prohibited ways, such as selling their memorabilia, signing endorsement deals or even offering private lessons.\nThe stark disparity in income between the players and those in the NCAA\u2019s web of wealth has long been part of the national conversation, and the intensity has heightened with the possibility of SB 206 becoming reality.\nAs James tweeted to his 43.6m followers, \u201cEveryone is California- call your politicians and tell them to support SB 206! This law is a GAME CHANGER. College athletes can responsibly get paid for what they do and the billions they create.\u201d\nWith the bill\u2019s fate on the brink, NCAA president Mark Emmert wrote a fiery letter to Newsom on Wednesday demanding he veto. Emmert called the act \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and threatened to boot California schools from NCAA competition, citing an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d.\nThe bill\u2019s co-author, state senator Nancy Skinner fired back at Emmert, calling his bluff and noting that the NCAA has lost many anti-trust decisions in the past.\nUnderstanding the battle between the players, who many consider \u201cindentured servants,\u201d the deep-moneyed NCAA, and the college sports purists who strongly believe in the amateur-professional divide requires a deeper examination of this contentious landscape.\nLate 2011 was the final straw for Tim Nevius. The then-NCAA investigator had been the lead investigator in the Ohio State tattoo \u201cscandal\u201d, in which several star players, including quarterback Terrelle Pryor, were suspended for five games for selling memorabilia in exchange for free and discounted tattoos. The intensity of the media coverage and the punishment, it all seemed so blown of out proportion to Nevius.\n\u201cThere was an element of discomfort as I worked on more and more cases and seeing what the universities were making off the talents of those young people and their inability to capitalize on their own skill,\u201d Nevius says.\nA year later he visited Jermil Martin, a former Ohio State running back who transferred after he was punished for exchanging memorabilia for a discount on a Chevy Tahoe. Martin never graduated college and was trying to get by in a rough neighborhood outside of Columbus, his dreams of earning a top education and launching a successful football career out of reach. Martin had tears in his eyes as he described being taken advantage of and how his life fell apart simply because of a discounted vehicle.\nNevius couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He left the NCAA and soon thereafter founded Nevius Legal, a company that helps college athletes navigate the NCAA\u2019s 400-page ever-changing rule book and all aspects of compliance. He more recently launched the College Athlete Advocacy Initiative, which lobbies for institutional reform. CAAI recently released a searing ad spotlighting the plight of the student athlete which for many is darker than it seems.\nWhen a school grants a player a scholarship they are essentially trading employment for a free (or reduced cost) education. Thanks to a 2015 victorious federal lawsuit by former UCLA basketball star Ed O\u2019Bannon against the NCAA, athletes on full scholarship are also eligible for a cost-of-living stipend, though it is often just enough for the basics. The athlete must operate under a litany of complex rules without the assistance of an agent or a union. Heavy fines, stripped eligibility and other punishments are only a minor misstep away.\nThe NCAA touts the value of a free education. For some this is true. You will hear about players like Andrew Luck, who earned an engineering degree from Stanford, or other payers who would thrive with or without football. But for many, especially the African Americans who live below the poverty line and make up a significant portion of basketball and football rosters in elite conferences, the reality is more grim.\nAccording to 2018 report from USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, just 55% of black athletes from the Power Five conferences, which includecollege sports\u2019 most profitable programs, graduate in six years as compared to 69.3% of all student-athletes.\nNevius says that many of those graduates are left with hollow futures. \u201cEverything is designed around the university and coach\u2019s priority of sports first so they\u2019re clustered into these majors that may not align with their academic interest and oftentimes do not give them the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life beyond sports,\u201d he says.\nAccording to the NCAA, fewer than 2% of college athletes go on to play professional sports.\nIn any organization that generates billions, top employees will pocket significant salaries. But in the NCAA, the figures are astronomical. Alabama football coach Nick Saban will make $8.3m this year. Kansas basketball coach Bill Self will make $7.9m. Emmert will take home $2.4m. In fact, the highest-paid state employee in 39 of the 50 states is a college football or basketball coach. These coaches can earn additional money from radio appearances, endorsement deals and, really, in any way they choose.\nMuch of the NCAA\u2019s revenue comes from television contracts. Its March Madness rights packages with CBS and Turner Sports bring in $800m in revenue alone. Passage of SB 206 would not make a dent in televisions contract figures or any aspect of the NCAA\u2019s nonstop flow of cash. It would simply afford athletes the chance to profit off their sliver of time as an expert in their field. As Skinner has pointed out, this is especially true for female athletes who have virtually no options in the professional sports market.\nThe NCAA asserts that amateurism protects a number of potential pitfalls, ranging from an uneven playing field to players living off campus to a reduced focus on academics. The swelling number of dissenters say these notions are baseless, an example of fear-mongering and an attempt for the NCAA maintain control of an antiquated system.\nIf SB 206 is signed into law, the NCAA could ban California schools from competing in its association as Emmert threatens. But taking that route would cost the NCAA significant amounts of revenue and an ungodly legal bill as this battle would likely head to the courts. It would also, as Emmert suggests, give California schools an advantage in recruiting even if they had to form some kind of independent league. Given this reality, passage of the bill could eventually force the NCAA to follow suit.\nThe more symbiotic move would be for the NCAA to work with lawmakers and enact the bill (or a similar version) across schools nationwide. There are the purists who want to protect the sanctity of amateurism yet each new bill and lawsuit is an inch closer to the inevitable.\nWhile passage of SB 206 would barrel away from amateurism in its purist form, there is a still a massive disparity between what a college athlete would make selling a jersey or offering hitting lessons vs. a professional athlete salary. Yet the ability to make some semblance of money might keep some elite athletes from declaring early, which would in turn generate even more revenue for the member school and the NCAA.\nPassage of SB 206 seems rational on several fronts, but Nevius doesn\u2019t see the multi-billion dollar entity that is the NCAA acquiescing without a continued fight.\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s so wasteful and tone deaf. This is the way things are going and it\u2019s widely recognized as the fair and right thing to do but the NCAA in the interest of money and control refuses to allow to this happen as it should.

Climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a central role to play.\u201d\nThe warning comes as concern over the impact of climate change and the lack of urgent action is increasing, reflected in the Extinction Rebellion protests and schoolchildren\u2019s strikes across the world.\nThe heads of two of the world\u2019s most influential central banks urged other financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, while also calling for more collaboration between nations on the issue. They warned that a \u201cmassive reallocation of capital\u201d was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2\u00b0C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement, with the banking system required to play a pivotal role.\n\u201cIf some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,\u201d Carney and De Galhau said.\nClimate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses.\nThere are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses.\nCarney has previously warned that plunging sales of diesel cars, due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had knock-on effects for manufacturers and the wider economy, are an example of this in action.\nBanks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (\u00a315.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed.\nThe open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change.\nGlobal warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses.\nAlthough they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself without tougher regulation being introduced.\nFrank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cCentral banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem.

But no young person should face being stood up by the NHS,\u201d said Vicki Nash, the charity\u2019s head of policy and campaigns. She added that a cancellation could set back both the young person\u2019s relationship with CAMHS staff at and potentially their mental health.\nNash said: \u201cHaving a mental health appointment cancelled can break a young person\u2019s trust in the health service. People are often at their most vulnerable at the point they receive professional support for issues as complex as eating disorders, self-harm and psychosis, let alone children who may be interacting with services for the first time in their lives.\n\u201cNo young person should have to worry about whether their next appointment will happen. Once someone enters the mental health system they deserve timely and consistent support that gives them the best possible chance of recovery.\n\u201cIt is deeply concerning that the number of cancelled appointments continues to rise, even in proportion to the increase in appointments. As demand grows under-supported staff are leaving in droves, and this can impact the gaps between appointments and chances of cancellation.\u201d\nThe figures underline the difficulties facing NHS England in honouring its ambitious pledges to transform access to specialist care for children and young people facing mental health challenges, and especially in reducing what are often long waits for care. Experts say the continuing fall in the number of mental health nurses and vacancies for specialist child psychiatrists in many CAMHS teams threaten delivery of the plans.\nThe number of under-18s in England referred to CAMHS has risen fast. It increased from 343,386 in 2017-18 to 405,479 last year \u2013 an 18% jump from the year before. Exam pressure, online bullying, pressure to look good, difficulties within families and dysfunctional backgrounds, as well as a greater openness among young people in acknowledging their condition and seeking help, have all been cited as explanations for the soaring demand.\nGPs revealed last week that many of the young people struggling mentally who were referred to CAMHS were rejected for being not ill enough. Sometimes the youngs people faced delays lasting months before they first saw a mental health professional.\nUnder-18s and their families cancelled about four times as many appointments as CAMHSproviders, the figures obtained by Mind also showed. During 2018 a total of 798,010 appointments were cancelled because the young person called off the meeting or did not attend. Overall, CAMHS services provided 3,734,000 appointments in 2018-19 where the patient did attend.\nEmma Thomas, the chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, urged ministers and NHS chiefs to ensure more help for young people as soon as they develop problems, and to go beyond just concentrating on improving access to CAMHS once patients become more ill.\nThomas said: \u201cThe next government must ensure service improvements through investment in the NHS, but also make sure that young people can get help when they first need it, whether that\u2019s through youth clubs, drop-in centres, local charities, schools, or online.

I\u2019m non-religious, liberal and sex positive and in no way \u201canti-porn\u201d.\nI started the #NotYourPorn campaign after a friend had her iCloud account hacked last year.\nVideos of her and an ex had been stolen from her phone and then uploaded to Pornhub. Pornhub is owned by a multi-national, multi-billion dollar tech company called Mindgeek. Mindgeek have offices in the UK, although they\u2019re registered in Luxembourg and their main office is based in Montreal, Canada.\nMindgeek\u2019s monopoly over the commercialised porn industry is staggering. Pornhub is not their only site \u2013 they also own Youporn among others, and also own production companies that make pornography.\nIn one year there were 42bn visits to Pornhub and 6m videos uploaded. To put that into context that\u2019s 115m visits per day, which Pornhub points out it\u2019s the \u201cequivalent of the populations of Canada, Australia, Poland and the Netherlands\u201d\nWe have tried to have my friend\u2019s videos taken down: we told the company that she was underage, that she didn\u2019t consent to being on their website and still it took several weeks to remove it. Unfortunately, by then the damage was already done. When one video had been removed, an identical video with her full name attached would pop back up again.\nThis cycle of reporting the video to Pornhub, delayed removal and subsequent re-uploading continued for months \u2013 until she ended up on Pornhub\u2019s top five trending videos in the UK.\nMy friend fell into a state of depression at the knowledge that she had been reduced to a search term, her body packaged up as porn and sold for profit.\nSince then I have worked with 50 women who were turned into \u201cporn stars\u2019\u201d without their permission \u2013 some of whom were under 18 \u2013 when videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent.\nBefore you tell yourself that this would never happen to you (because you wouldn\u2019t be so careless as to have a video of yourself like that in the first place) then I\u2019d ask you to consider Catherine\u2019s* case. Catherine got in contact with me when she found that her ex had been secretly recording them having sex, and without her knowledge uploading these videos to Pornhub for glory \u2013 and even a cash reward. When Catherine discovered his Pornhub page, she found videos of what appeared to be other unsuspecting victims too, all promoted under \u201csecret recording\u201d categories on the website.\nSecret recording categories can still be found on Pornhub.\nThe issue has become more widely known in recent months, with other women coming forward. Recently, Rose Kalemba shared with the BBC how her rape at aged 14 was also uploaded to Pornhub. Rose described how finding her rape on the porn website being used as \u201ccontent\u201d forced her to re-live her nightmare.\nWithin 24 hours of the article going live, Rose\u2019s full name appeared as a suggested search term on Pornhub.\nPornhub say that cases of child sexual abuse rarely appear on the platform, but an investigation by the #NotYourPorn campaign working with the Times last year found, with only a short search, a number of child sexual abuse images on the site. Disturbingly, these videos could be found in under five minutes. Tags like \u201cstolen drunken teen video\u201d or \u201cpublic flash to young girl\u201d and \u201cyoung teen snapchat leak\u201d promoted these child abuse images even further. Although we reported these videos, it took several days for any action to be taken. \nRose Kalemba experienced the same as she pleaded with the site to take down the videos of her rape telling Pornhub she was a minor in the video. The headings the videos of Rose appeared under included \u201cteen abused while sleeping\u201d, \u201cdrunk teen abuse sleeping\u201d and \u201cextreme teen abuse\u201d.\nSimilar categories with the same sentiments are still promoted on Pornhub today\nHere in the UK we are now waiting to hear what the new online harms bill will offer in terms of regulating the porn industry. There is no independent or government-linked body which monitors the content commercialised porn companies are promoting.\nPornhub hide themselves behind freedom of expression and argue that all sexual fantasies on their site are just that: legitimate fantasies acted out by consenting adults. They have defended the \u201cyoung teen\u201d and \u201cdrunk stolen snapchat\u201d categories as legitimate fantasy protected by freedom of speech. \nLet me be clear: this isn\u2019t about censorship or stifling kinks \u2013 there are plenty of ethical porn companies who have strong systems in place to ensure everyone involved in production is a consenting adult. This is about a huge corporation profiting from non-consensual videos \u2013 and an industry that publishes abusive content with no regulatory body or government holding them to account.\nThe question remains: how much longer will we tolerate the commercialisation of non-consensual content before this government takes a stand?\nAnd will it have to happen to you before you care?\n*Some names change to protect victim anonymity\nKate Isaacs, founder of the #NotYourPorn campaign is calling on the UK government to ban the porn giant until it cleans up its non-consensual sexual abuse content\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Pornhub has insisted it has robust procedures to stop illegal content being posted. \u201cPornhub has a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-349": {"text": "Has the politics of climate change finally reached a tipping point?\nLast week a small campaign group in the staunchly conservative town of Shrewsbury called a public meeting about climate change. The organisers were delighted when 150 people turned up. Even they were surprised, though, when people unanimously said they were prepared to give up flying, change their boilers and cars, eat less meat and even overthrow capitalism to get a grip on climate change.\nBut this was just a straw in the political wind whipping through middle England. Shrewsbury joins more than 100 other councils across the country in declaring a climate emergency, and has pledged that it will be carbon-neutral within 11 years, with more following every week.\nThe stakes get higher every day. In the past week, not only have the world\u2019s leading scientists dropped a bomb into the debate by stating, across 1,800 pages of detailed evidence, that our wholesale destruction of the biosphere threatens humanity just as much as climate change, but carbon levels in the atmosphere have reached their highest level in 800,000 years.\nSo, could this be the moment when politicians recognise they have both strong intellectual reason to act urgently on the environment as well as, finally, the public backing to do so? When, instead of trying to score marginal partisan points, they believe they have the legitimacy to be non-partisan, politically bold, and to together back transformative economic and social change in pursuit of the public good? Could politics indeed be changing with the climate?\nThe last few months have seen the debate shift. Put it down to David Attenborough\u2019s documentary, 1.5 million children on school strike, the charisma of Greta Thunberg, or sheer frustration with the political system, but increasing numbers of people now seem to recognise that nature\u2019s wellbeing is a national priority.\nThe UK government, keen to position itself as a world leader on climate, but still promoting flying and roads and less keen to act at home, recognises the moment. Cambridge development economist Sir Partha Dasgupta has been commissioned to conduct a major study on the case for acting on biodiversity, much as Lord Stern was asked to review the economics of climate change by Gordon Brown in 2006. Stern\u2019s 700-page report added greatly to the debate. But that was 13 years ago, since which time there have been many highly authoritative studies done on environmental economics. No new report is needed. They all argue roughly the same: that it will cost infinitely more for governments to do nothing about biodiversity and climate than to act decisively, and that to delay will increase costs further. Dasgupta can only argue that we must act soon.\nBesides, while it sounds impressive to bring forward by 30 years the target for net-zero emissions, few countries think it will be too difficult. Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden have asked the EU to set 2050 as a target for being carbon-neutral, and want 25% of the EU budget to go to fighting climate change. For the moment, governments have little to lose. Most consumers would barely notice the changes needed to get to carbon neutrality in 30 years\u2019 time. Who noticed that Britain has just had the first week in more than 100 years of electricity without coal, or that divestment from fossil fuels has reached $8tn? People will have to buy electric cars, more efficient fridges and heating systems, and Britain will need vastly more solar capacity, bigger forests and better insulation, but these are mostly easy and popular changes.\nA \u201cnew green deal\u201d budget could be brought in to fund a massive push for nature conservation and energy change. The ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans after 2040 could be brought forward to 2030 easily enough, and few people would object to penalties for climate polluters, higher taxes for companies that destroy nature and incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation. If Heathrow never got its new runway, or we did not build more roads, or we all ate less meat, it would not hurt that much.\nIndeed, it\u2019s clear that protecting nature brings great collective rewards. Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels would clear up air pollution rapidly and save billions of pounds a year that the NHS must currently spend dealing with heart attacks, asthma, strokes and respiratory illnesses. Cities would become more liveable, the countryside more attractive. Instead of being regarded by government as a costly imposition, action on climate and nature regeneration could be easily recast as visionary politics offering huge public benefits.\nBut what happens when the voluntary measures run out and the warming is not seen to slow because greenhouse gases are so long-lasting? Really addressing climate and biodiversity collapse means rationing carbon. It means no more free ride for extractive industries such as mining, palm oil and forestry companies who profit from environmental destruction. It means heavy penalties for polluters, the axing of food and aviation subsidies, and taking a torch to vested interests. It means addressing the indirect causes of the crisis, such as population growth and consumerism, even rethinking the whole idea of progress and wealth.\nThere are dangers in both action and inaction. How will rich countries react to mass migrations from poor climate-affected countries, or to the breakdown of the food system that might ensue when climate change leads to disastrous harvests in major rice- and wheat-producing countries? Already, the UN says, there are around 2,500 conflicts over fossil fuels, water, food and land. Climate change and biodiversity loss will only increase that number.\nThen there is the risk that the climate crisis could foster a new generation of authoritarian, top-down rulers who will try bypassing consumers and institutions. This is because it necessitates a major shift from the kind of individual responsibility we have grown used to in the past 50 years, to greater state action. That could easily be exploited.\nIt also opens the door for rich governments to propose dangerous and ill-thought-through technological fixes as a substitute for mitigation. How much simpler for cash-strapped governments to ask a few billionaires to help slow warming in the US or Europe by funding a monstrously expensive plan to preserve the Arctic sea ice by covering it with a layer of reflective silica \u201cmicrobubbles\u201d; or to deflect the sun\u2019s rays in space; or to spray the oceans with iron filings?\nBut the risks of doing nothing far outweigh the possible pitfalls of really addressing climate change and biodiversity collapse. Of course there will be objections from diehard capitalists and liberals alike. But, to echo Margaret Thatcher as she pushed through the deregulation that has done so much to fuel the crisis: there really is no alternative.\n\u2022 John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor", "label": 0}, "text-350": {"text": "Jess Phillips calls for citizens\u2019 assembly to tackle climate crisis\nLabour leadership contender Jess Phillips has called for a citizens\u2019 assembly on how Britain should tackle climate change, as part of what she called a six-point plan to restore trust in democracy.\nLabour\u2019s manifesto called for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d to pour investment into clean technologies, partly funded by a windfall tax on oil companies \u2013 a policy fronted by the leftwing favourite for the leadership, Rebecca Long-Bailey.\nThe plans were thrashed out in consultation with trade unions, after Labour members passed a motion at their autumn conference calling for an ambitious target of hitting net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.\nIn an article in the Guardian, Phillips, whose campaign slogan is \u201cspeak truth, win power\u201d, said the public should be more directly involved in determining what policies Britain should adopt to tackle the climate crisis.\n\u201cOn climate breakdown, we need a plan that involves the public much more.

The 22-year-old nursing student and her fellow protesters known as \u201cfighters\u201d for their willingness to confront police in Hong Kong, had decided to make their last stand on 31 August.\nExhausted and weary after months of protesting, she had floated the idea of throwing herself at police and forcing them to fire on her. The other protesters talked her out of it. Still, she expected to be arrested or badly hurt.\nBut on the day of the march, Cheng was hit by a water cannon and forced to leave early. In the weeks afterward, instead of relief, she only felt a sense of malaise. When she lost her wallet, including her ID card, her first thought was that it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cI had zero motivation to do anything. I just thought it was all useless, meaningless,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realised I need to get my normal life back.\u201d\nAs political unrest continues to roil Hong Kong, public health experts say a quieter and in some ways more dangerous battle is under way as more residents display signs of depression, anxiety, and acute stress.\nSince June, protesters have tracked at least nine cases of suicides that appear to be directly linked to the demonstrations. Social workers fear more young people will take their lives as the protests enter their fifth month, with no sign of resolution and increasingly violent confrontations.\nMental illness is universal, affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world. No country is spared, and when it comes to treatments, every country is a developing country.\u00a0\nCauses are legion: stress, shock, grief, trauma (particularly if sustained in childhood). Naturally, conflict of any kind will generate many of these causative factors and increase the risk of mental illness in the population.\nStudy after study has proven this to be true. This mini-series, part of the Guardian's global mental health project in 2019, hears from the people directly affected. \nPublic health advocates, NGOs and counsellors say the number of calls and threats of suicide they have received has increased, especially in recent weeks.\nIt is not just the protesters who are at risk. A study by Hong Kong University released in July found nearly one in 10 were suffering from probable depression, as well as an increase in suicidal thoughts, from 1.1% at the start of this decade.\nGabriel Leung, head of the study, said that there was little difference in prevalence among those who did or did not attend protests, suggesting a \u201ccommunity-wide spillover effect.\u201d Leung called the situation a \u201cmental health epidemic\u201d.\n\u201cThe whole of society is suffering,\u201d said Clarence Tsang, executive director of Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, an NGO focusing on suicide prevention. \u201cThis is generating a lot of pressure on the whole of society. At this big scale, it is affecting almost the whole population,\u201d he said.\nFor Cheng, that pressure has at times been too much. Between school, work and the movement, she often sleeps no more than four hours a night. After a fight with her father over the protests, she was kicked out and now stays with friends, moving every few nights. After months of seeing fellow protesters tear-gassed, arrested, and beaten by police, in July she first considered suicide.\n\u201cI was so tired of the life I was living and sometimes I would like to take a break but I would feel guilty. So I thought maybe it\u2019s time for me. Maybe it is the last thing I can do for the protests, and I can take a break without any guilty thinking,\u201d she said.\nPublic health experts say the protesters, many of them around Cheng\u2019s age or younger, may not be equipped to deal with the exposure to violence and push themselves to extremes.\n\u201cSome of them are very young, very naive, very pure in their hearts. They just throw themselves in,\u201d said Yip Siu Fai, director of the Centre of Suicide Research and Prevention at Hong Kong University. \u201cThey might not be psychologically mature enough. For them, the possible damage could be quite severe.\u201d\nWe keep going on the street, but the government hasn\u2019t responded so the youngsters will commit suicide to raise, to keep the noise of the movement up.\nObservers also worry the martyrdom of those who have killed themselves could encourage others. The nine \u201cprotest suicides\u201d fuelled the early stage of the movement as victims were portrayed as making the ultimate sacrifice for the movement.\nOne of those is Lo Hiu Yan, a 21-year-old piano student, who fell to her death from an apartment building on 29 June. She had written on a wall: \u201cHong Kongers, we\u2019ve protested for a long time, but we shouldn\u2019t forget our faith. We must keep on.\u201d\nAccording to her friends, Lo supported the protests but she had not been consumed by them. Talkative, artistic, and empathetic, she was more focused on her hobbies, friends, and latest love interest, her friends said.\nHer friends believe that for Lo, who had threatened suicide before the protests began, the unrest may have been a trigger but not the root cause. They also worry about the glorification of such deaths.\n\u201cHero is not an appropriate word,\u201d said Peter Leung, 21, a friend of Lo\u2019s from university. \u201cIt is never worth it.\u201d\nToday, protesters cite the suicides as motivation. As the protests have shrunk, some have grown desperate, according to Kevin Chiu, 33, part of a team of volunteer social workers. Chiu has seen cases increase in the last few weeks.\n\u201cWe keep going on the street, but the government hasn\u2019t responded so the youngsters will commit suicide to raise, to keep the noise of the movement up,\u201d he said.\nExperts say the situation is not hopeless. Teams of volunteers on the messaging platform Telegram are on high alert and quickly crowdsource the location of suicide attempts. Social workers, sometimes paired with psychologists, rush to the scene.\n\u201cThere is very strong interpersonal support among protesters and among those giving all kinds of support to them. I think that resilience and strength can act as a counterbalance,\u201d said Yip Kim Ching, a clinical psychologist and part of a group of volunteer psychologists offering counselling.\nCheng is also adapting. She is focusing on her nursing degree and trying to mend ties with her family. To let out some of her anger, whenever she passes police she gives them the middle finger. She also runs every night in a park and is building up her strength. \nShe says: \u201cI think things have some meaning now. At this moment, I\u2019m still a nursing student. I\u2019m still safe from the police. Maybe I can still save a lot of people.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Janice Hui\n\u2022 International suicide helplines can be found atwww.befrienders.org.

And by his calculations, humans cannot develop any new sources of coal, oil or natural gas without cooking the planet.\nMcKibben presents his argument as if it were based on simple arithmetic, mental math so easy you can do it in your head. In reality, calculating the impact of human activity on global temperature involves using advanced algebra with innumerable variables, which makes creating accurate assessments incredibly difficult.\nNearly everyone \u2014 even people who are often labeled as \"deniers\"\u2014agrees that increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will have some warming impact on the planet. But there is serious disagreement over how sensitive the climate is to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide.\nThe relationship between carbon dioxide and temperature is not linear; it is logarithmic. Each time CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere double, there is a constant, or linear, temperature change. This means, theoretically, each additional molecule of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere traps heat less effectively than the previous molecule.\nAlthough an imperfect analogy, this situation is somewhat similar to people who develop a tolerance for alcohol. As a person consumes increasing amounts of alcohol on a regular basis, the effect of each individual drink on his or her body lessens over time. As a result, a heavy drinker must consume much more alcohol to produce a result that someone who drinks infrequently may experience after only a drink or two.\nSo, how significant will the impact on warming be when the amount of CO2 in the air is doubled? Estimates by some climate scientists put the potential future increase at only 1.75 degrees Celsius, and even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one of the most prominent climate change alarmist organizations in the world, has reduced its estimates for how much warming will directly result from more CO2 in the atmosphere.\nEstimates of catastrophic global warming are not based only on the impact of greenhouse gases on temperature, but also on theoretical feedback mechanisms. One example of a feedback mechanism is cloud cover. Do more clouds make Earth warmer or colder? How much do natural phenomena such as ocean currents and sunspots influence global temperature?\nThese are just a few of the important variables ignored by McKibben, making his \"math\" overly simplistic.\nFurthermore, if McKibben truly believed his own math, he would be advocating for an immediate decrease in CO2 emissions in the most cost-effective way possible; more about that method below.\nBut he does not do that in his article. Instead, McKibben proposes to increase wind and solar energy capacity.\nThis proposal, however, is anything but a solution, because wind and solar, combined, account for only 2.2 percent of all the energy consumed in the United States \u2014 compared to 8.5 percent for nuclear, 18 percent for coal, 28 percent for natural gas and 35 percent for oil. And the Energy Information Administration says America's reliance on traditional energy sources is unlikely to change anytime soon.\nIf McKibben and other climate alarmists truly want to reduce CO2 emissions as quickly as possible, they should advocate for a massive build out of nuclear power instead. They have not done so, a fact that calls into question the alarmists' true motives.\nMcKibben is more a birthday party magician than a mathematician; he uses sleight-of-hand in an attempt to make the \"Keep It in the Ground\" movement relevant as it continues to obstruct crucial infrastructure projects, such as the Dakota Access Pipeline.\nMcKibben's claims about the impending doom of the planet ignore the reality Americans and billions of other people around the world depend on fossil fuels. Phasing the fuels out in the way McKibben suggests and replacing them suddenly with wind and solar energy sources is woefully unrealistic and irresponsible.\nOrr is a research fellow specializing in hydraulic fracturing at the Heartland Institute, a nonprofit whose mission is \"to discover, develop and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems.\"\n[Originally Published in\u00a0Grand Forks Herald]", "label": 1}, "text-354": {"text": "This week is Polar Bear Week (5-11 Nov 2017).

Polar bears are now doing so well that in some areas there is actually an overpopulation problem, with significant impacts on other species, including man. That is the truth that the public are not being told.\u201d\nAs global leaders meet in Bonn for COP23 (6\u201317 November 2017), it\u2019s time to celebrate the proven resilience of polar bears to their ever-changing Arctic environment.", "label": 1}, "text-355": {"text": "New Zealand begins genetic program to produce low methane-emitting sheep\nThe New Zealand livestock industry has begun a \u201cglobal first\u201d genetic program that would help to tackle climate change by breeding low methane-emitting sheep.\nThere are about six sheep for each person in New Zealand, and the livestock industry accounts for about one-third of the country\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe livestock industry\u2019s peak body, Beef and Lamb New Zealand, already uses a measure called \u201cbreeding value\u201d to help breeders select rams with characteristics they want to bolster within their flocks. Within two years breeders will be able to select rams whose traits include lower methane emissions.\n\u201cFarmers are more interested than I anticipated,\u201d said a stud breeder, Russell Proffit. His family has been producing rams for more than 40 years.\n\u201cI\u2019ve undertaken the [methane] measurements because I believe an animal that is healthy and doing well should produce less methane and I wanted to test that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case yet, but either way breeding for less methane complements what we are working to achieve on our stud. That is, more robust rams that require [fewer] inputs and make less demand on the environment.\u201d\nBreeders who want to produce low-methane rams will need to measure a portion of their flock in an accumulation chamber, where their gas emissions are measured. Sheep spend 50 minutes in the chamber, and must be measured twice with an interval of more than 14 days.\nThe resulting data is used alongside other genetic information to calculate a \u201cmethane breeding value\u201d.\nFarmers who want to participate are expected to have access to breeding rams within two years, given the time it takes to breed the rams on a commercial scale.\nThe pastoral greenhouse gas research consortium, which is jointly funded by the agricultural sector and the government, said the concept was to take advantage of variations in levels of methane emissions and research that found the differences were passed on to the next generation.\n\u201cThis is a global first for any species of livestock,\u201d the consortium\u2019s general manager, Mark Aspin, said.\n\u201cLaunching the methane breeding value gives New Zealand\u2019s sheep sector a practical tool to help lower our agricultural greenhouse gases. This is significant. Up until now, the only option available to farmers wanting to lower their greenhouse gas emissions has been to constantly improve their overall farming efficiency.\n\u201cThis takes us a step further \u2013 towards actually lowering sheep methane emissions, in keeping with the sector\u2019s commitment to work towards reducing its greenhouse emissions.\u201d\nProgress via breeding could be about 1% a year, but it would be cumulative and have no negative impact on farm productivity.\nAspin said amounts of feed were the biggest factor that contributed to methane emissions, and the consortium was working on three technologies that aimed to reduce amounts of methane generated by feed.\n\u201cSo by breeding sheep that produce less methane per mouthful eaten \u2013 as other methane-reducing technologies come on stream \u2013 the influence of these sheep on the national flock\u2019s methane production becomes compounding.\u201d\nBeef and Livestock New Zealand\u2019s chief executive, Sam McIvor, said recent research of 1,000 farmers found that information about reducing greenhouse emissions was among farmers\u2019 top five priorities.", "label": 0}, "text-356": {"text": "Debenhams pushes on with shop closures after legal challenge fails\nDebenhams is to press ahead with a rescue plan involving the closure of more than 20 stores after fighting off a Sports Direct-backed legal challenge.\nThe judge Mr Justice Norris on Thursday said he had rejected the challenge to the department store chain\u2019s compulsory voluntary arrangement (CVA) plan on four out of five grounds. \nStefaan Vansteenkiste, the Debenhams chief executive, said: \u201cWe are delighted that the court has today confirmed that our CVA is effective and will continue to be implemented as planned. We note that the only aspect that the judge required to be adjusted was a technical provision of the CVA relating to landlord forfeiture provisions.\n\u201cOur proposals had unprecedented levels of support from our landlords and today\u2019s outcome is good news for our 25,000 employees, our pensioners and suppliers. We retain the support of our lenders, and everyone at Debenhams can continue to focus on trading ahead of the important Christmas period.\u201d\nThe CVA involves the closure of at least 22 of Debenhams\u2019 166 UK stores in January 2020 and rent cuts on many other shops.\nLandlords and other creditors, such as clothing suppliers, approved store closures, which formed part of two CVA deals that Debenhams\u2019 new owners have said are necessary to prevent the business collapsing.\nThe CVA came after Debenhams went into administration wiping out shareholders including the near 30% stake in the chain owned by Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, a stake that cost at least \u00a3150m to build up. The department store is controlled by its lenders, including US hedge funds Silver Point and Golden Tree, as well as Barclays and Bank of Ireland.\nSports Direct backed the legal challenge by a private Salford-based landlord owned by the family of property investor Aubrey Weis, which owns six Debenhams properties. Ashley\u2019s retail group was blocked from taking legal action itself.\nThe legal action was the latest gambit in Ashley\u2019s battle with the department store. The CVA deal thwarted an attempt by the Sports Direct boss to take control.\nIn Thursday\u2019s judgment, Norris said it was entirely plausible that Sports Direct was trying to disrupt Debenhams\u2019 CVA in order to acquire the business at an advantageous price or to eliminate a competitor to its House of Fraser chain. But he said: \u201cIt does not mean that the applicants have no legitimate interest in pursuing the [case].\u201d\nSports Direct declined to comment and CPC, Weis\u2019s property firm, did not answer requests for comment.\nHowever, it is understood that the deletion of the clause regarding forfeiture offers landlords more flexibility in taking back stores after an initial 90-day period.

The growing crisis has left golfers concerned the Masters will be played behind closed doors, or called off altogether.\nThe potential for a Masters free from spectators dominated discussion during the first round of the Players Championship, after the PGA Tour imposed a closed-door policy for the final 54 holes at Sawgrass. The PGA later announced that the Sawgrass event has been cancelled.\nJay Monahan, the Tour\u2019s commissioner, revealed he held discussions with President Trump before announcing the initial ban on spectators. Attention has now turned towards the first major of the year \u2013 due to tee off on 9 April \u2013 with an update expected from Augusta National imminently.\n\u201cIt would be very unusual without hearing the roars echoing through the valley,\u201d said Jordan Spieth, the 2015 Masters champion, of an empty Augusta. \u201cYou can feed off a crowd anywhere and it can also a add a bit of pressure as well, in certain situations. This isn\u2019t ideal for anyone but I think if you polled the players we would rather have the Masters go on without spectators than not go on at all. I think you would probably get a unanimous vote on that one.

Prior to Lewis Capaldi\u2019s performance at Glasgow\u2019s SSE Hydro on Thursday night, there were pockets of calm as fans undertook breathwork classes to learn how to stay centred in a crowded space.\nCapaldi, the UK\u2019s bestselling musician of 2019, has rolled out Livelive, a pioneering mental health initiative for gig-goers attending his arena tour. After the 23-year-old Scottish star openly discussed his own history of panic attacks in interviews, he received dozens of messages from fans thanking him for speaking publicly.\nThis influx of support and shared experiences of panic and anxiety convinced Capaldi and his team that coming up with such an initiative for his biggest shows to date was essential, said Livelive co-founder Jack Williamson. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Thank you \u2013 I feel less alone.\u2019 Or, \u2018I have social anxiety and that\u2019s stopped me from coming to your shows.\u2019 One in 10 people have anxiety, and we saw that there was an opportunity for us to provide that support for people.\u201d\nLivelive offers an email support service so fans can inquire about facilities prior to a performance. One hour before doors open, Capaldi posts meeting points for a gig-buddy system on Instagram, designed for solo gig-goers to find company. A help desk in the foyer promotes awareness and points people towards longer-term resources. Behind this, a quiet space is set aside for anyone feeling overwhelmed. Medical staff and trained mental health professionals are on hand to provide extra care.\nFan Kevin, 23, said: \u201cLewis is such a legend for doing it, honestly. It\u2019s something that society needs and he\u2019s at the forefront.\u201d\nInspired by the work of Attitude Is Everything, a charity that improves accessibility for deaf and disabled people at live performances, Williamson says the team behind Livelive want mental health support at gigs to become an industry standard.\nWhile their research indicates that Livelive is the first initiative of its kind at this scale, it builds on work being carried out across the arts to make venues more accessible, from relaxed performances in the theatre to dementia-friendly cinema screenings. This weekend\u2019s BBC 6 Music festival in Camden, London, features a designated relaxation space with quiet music and beanbags.\nThe logistics behind Livelive are complex. Undertaking background checks, safeguarding and policy work is time-consuming and expensive, although Livelive works with volunteers from mental health organisations local to each performance. At a smaller show in Manchester earlier in the week they collaborated with 42nd Street, a mental health charity that offered support to young people following the Manchester arena bombing. In Glasgow some volunteers came from local social enterprise LifeLink.\nAn extra 50p has been added to ticket prices to fund the scheme. Still, the budget remains tight, and Livelive provides any additional funding, said Williamson: \u201cWith economies of scale, it will get easier to do.\u201d\nHe argued that there was a strong business case for this kind of initiative: \u201cWe did initial research on Lewis\u2019s socials and 83% of respondents out of 232,712 people said that if this kind of support was available at other shows, it would increase the likelihood of them purchasing a ticket. To see that kind of interest is fascinating, and to see that it could increase turnout and financial generation too.\u201d\nFinding a suitable space for the initiative within a crowded arena can be difficult. For the Glasgow performances, venue sponsors were invited to volunteer to give up their place in a private lounge in order to accommodate the scheme. Colin Banks, head of sponsorship at SSE, said the response was positive. \u201cIt gives you back some faith in the human race.\u201d\nFans attending the Glasgow show welcomed the scheme. Taylor, 20, said: \u201cI know Lewis suffers from [anxiety] so it\u2019s great that people can come here and get that support. I have anxiety myself, and knowing that the support is here makes all the difference.\u201d\nAngela, 59, had not heard of the scheme prior to the gig: \u201cThe more people who know about it the better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that people are talking about this kind of thing.\u201d\nRyan, 28, agreed. \u201cI saw it on his Instagram. My little brother doesn\u2019t like coming to gigs but this would definitely help.\u201d\nWilliamson is confident about the longevity of Livelive. He confirms that the scheme has been in talks with other musicians in the UK and US about creating similar initiatives for their tours, as well as with other venues and promoters across the country.\n\u201cUltimately I don\u2019t care who does it as long as it gets done,\u201d he says. \u201cIn an ideal world this support would be available at any venue.

Salt infiltrates the drinking water, and imbues the vegetables with a sharp tang.\nIncreasing salinity almost wiped out the local shrimp industry back in the mid-90s, and these days many local fishermen have switched from collecting shrimp to hunting the more climatically resilient mud crab.\nBut even as they adapt, locals remain extremely vulnerable. Mud crabs are becoming increasingly scarce, and as farmers venture into the mangrove forest to collect them, they are falling prey to gangs of pirates who kidnap them for ransom, forcing their families into debt. Loan sharks have spotted the opportunity and are now preying on the villagers too.\nSomehow they are surviving, but many are looking for a way out.\nAround Datina Khali, the aquaculture industry dominates the landscape, with sleepy villages surrounded by an earthen patchwork of shrimp ponds and soft-shell crab farms.\nIn the stifling early morning heat, Shuvendro Nath Mistry is surveying his two hectare shrimp farm, as a group of women knee-deep in water pull weeds from his ponds.\n\u201cThe shrimp haven\u2019t grown well this year. In this hot weather it is harder for them to grow,\u201d admits Mistry, his arms crossed over his bare chest. \u201cIf the salinity increases the shrimp will not die, but production will decrease. But if the heat increases, the shrimp will die.\u201d\nToday the crippling temperatures are one of the shrimp farmers\u2019 biggest concerns. Mistry is all too aware of the precarious situation of his trade, and watchful for the next problem that could bring the industry to its knees \u2013 as happened 20 years ago, when white spot disease spread through the farms, brought on by the increased levels of salt.\nDuring the crisis, farmers noticed that mud crabs were naturally invading the decimated shrimp ponds, and seized the opportunity for some marginal returns. As a result, some deserted their old stocks and switched to crab cultivation instead.\nAlthough still nascent and smaller than the now recovered shrimp industry, Bangladesh\u2019s crab production has proved a success story. With rising international demand from countries such as China, Singapore and Malaysia, the export of mud crab from the south Asian nation reached $24m (\u00a319m) in 2015\u201316.\nNow the area\u2019s aquaculture is divided between shrimp and soft-shell crab farming, and collecting wild mud crabs from the Sundarbans for export, or to be fattened up in local farms.\nYet the irony is that amid a shift to a more climatically resilient industry, those on its frontline, the fishermen who venture into the mangrove forest, find themselves more and more at risk.\nFor years, small pirate gangs have roamed the watery capillaries of the Sundarbans, hiding out in the dense forest as they stake out fishermen to kidnap and hold for ransom.\nThere are a few horror stories \u2013 of fishermen being severely beaten, or having their Achilles tendons sliced \u2013 but for the most part the piratical target is financial.\nAs soon as they capture a victim, the pirates head for areas within the forest known for the best cell reception, sometimes climbing trees for a clear line, so they can call a terrified victim\u2019s family to demand a ransom via electronic transfer. So organised are some they even have their own business cards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so stressful when the men get kidnapped,\u201d exclaims Shefali Bibi, a pickle maker and fisherman\u2019s wife from Datina Khali, dressed in a bright yellow and purple sari. \u201cThose are the worst days. I can\u2019t eat, or sleep or bathe.\u201d\nIn the past decade, pirates have twice kidnapped her husband and held him for ransom, each time causing immense financial strain.\nOf about 1,600 fishermen and crab collectors in Datina Khali, almost all have been kidnapped once \u2013 others up to four or five times.\nTo address the rampant banditry, the government has in recent years launched a huge crackdown, offering pirates lucrative sums to surrender.\nRoughly 29 pirate groups brandishing more than 400 firearms have given themselves up since 2015, with the last batch reportedly surrendering in November 2018, when the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, declared the Unesco-listed Sundarbans \u201cpirate free\u201d.\nBut while the situation is significantly better, local fishermen say there are at least three pirate gangs still operating, with kidnappings occurring up to once a week.\n\u201cThere are fewer pirate groups now, but the situation is unchanged. If they find us we still have to pay them,\u201d says 32-year-old Moniral Islam Gazi, a crab collector who was captured this April. \u201cI am not really scared of being caught because I have faced it a lot, but I am scared about where to find the money.\u201d\nIf pirates capture them as they eke out a meagre existence collecting mud crabs and wild honey, they are quickly plunged into vicious cycles of debt.\nBack in the village, when a family member receives a ransom call they are thrust into a state of panic. Most have little, if any, savings. With payments ranging anywhere from 20,000 to 250,000 Bangladeshi taka (\u00a3182 \u2013 \u00a32,270), many are forced to take loans.\nOf almost half a dozen crab collectors interviewed, all but one had a loan. Many had multiple loans, from local businessmen, village loan sharks and microcredit agencies.\n\u201cSometimes they need a loan just to pay for their forest permit and supplies,\u201d explains Srikander Ali, a local crab broker at the nearby Katakhali fish market, who reckons the kidnappings still occur between eight and 10 times a month.\n\u201cI also give them loans for the ransoms. If they get caught it affects my business too,\u201d he says, glancing at baskets of wriggling mud crab stacked against the wall, soon to be trucked to Dhaka for live export. \u201cI estimate that about 80% are in a pretty bad financial position.\u201d\nSitting opposite her husband in their canoe, as he gently scoops up his line from the khaki waters, Henna Bibi is pragmatic about her choices.\n\u201cThere are a lot of fear factors in the forest,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if we get scared we won\u2019t be able to raise our children.\u201d\nFor safety, they set out into the forest in numbers. But these days there is also the problem of supply \u2013 once bountiful, wild mud crabs are becoming increasingly hard to find.\n\u201cThe number of crabs has dropped noticeably in the last six years,\u201d says Muhammad Didar Boxfaksis, 65. \u201cOn a good day, we can get 5\u20137kg, but 15 years ago it was double that.\u201d\n\u201cWe used to throw the smaller crabs back,\u201d agrees his neighbour, Sobed Ali. \u201cNow, we take everything we can find.\u201d\nMojibar Rahman, who is researching a PhD on crab cultivation at the Bangladesh Agricultural University, says the shortage is likely to result from over-collection.\nTo make the industry more sustainable, the government needs to invest in mud-crab hatcheries, he suggests, instead of being almost entirely reliant on wild stocks.\n\u201cThe crab industry is still underdeveloped because of a lack of culture technology and a lack of seeds [baby crabs],\u201d he explains, adding that some farmers have also shied away from crab cultivation because, in the Muslim-majority nation, crabs are viewed as haram (forbidden).\nWith the myriad challenges before them, some local fishermen are looking for a way out. Many of the younger men have already left, seeking work in urban brick factories.\nThe older fishermen claim that if it weren\u2019t for the pirates they would make more than enough, but Sobed Ali is tired of waiting, and luckily has a small amount of money to invest in adapting his business.\n\u201cThe money I make, I don\u2019t end up using it myself, it ends up as pirate bail,\u201d says the exasperated father of three. \u201cIt makes my life miserable.\u201d\nWith their savings from harvesting crab and selling pickles, and a loan from a Japanese trading company, Ali and his wife have converted a piece of land they own in the village into a small soft-shell crab farm.\n\u201cI have to secure my children\u2019s future, so that\u2019s why I am starting the soft-shell crab farming,\u201d says Ali, as he hammers together an adjacent shelter in the fading light.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my sons to go into the forest like me.

That thing someone somewhere said online that doesn\u2019t exactly chime with your worldview. The colour of your passport that the evil EU has always allowed us to change if we could be bothered. Or the disdainful manner with which big clubs like Liverpool treat the FA Cup, while lower-league purists like Brentford make eight changes in order to prepare for a do-or-die clash with Nottingham Forest that if, say, they lost 1-0, would leave them in fifth place in the Championship, exactly where they were when they started. Ooh, the sheer arrogance of that Klopp/EU mandarin/guy on internet forum. Fume!\nBut just imagine supporting a club that hasn\u2019t won a major European trophy for 979 days, is one match away from the Milk Cup final, is still in with a shout of winning both the FA Cup and Big Vase and is suffering such a bad season they\u2019ve plummeted as low as fifth in the Premier League, a competition they\u2019ve won 13 times in its first 27 seasons?

For a start, in Bruno Fernandes they\u2019re extremely close to signing their first decent midfielder since Roy Keane left for the pundit\u2019s chair on MUTV all those years ago, while Woodward seems to have got shot of Marcos Rojo, bound for Estudiantes, which has surely got to count for something. Then later on, it\u2019s quite feasible that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side could win at Manchester City like they did last month, force a penalty shootout, and make their first domestic cup final since the sepia-toned misty memories of May 2018. Because when all\u2019s said and done, it\u2019s a Manchester derby and City are still City.\nHaving said all that, there\u2019s also a chance that City could run up a cricket score, like they threatened to do at Old Trafford in the first leg.

Married to one of the country\u2019s most famous political leaders for nearly 40 years, she has stayed resolutely in the background, and prefers it there.\n\u201cI\u2019m no Glenys Kinnock,\u201d she said in her first \u2013 and only \u2013 media interview, with the Sunday Post in 1990. \u201cI married Alex, not politics. That\u2019s his life and I am happy to be in the background. I share his convictions, but one politician in the family is quite enough.\u201d\nOther than a few brief appearances with Salmond at election counts, there have been no election broadcast cameos or lifestyle features at their detached period home, a converted former mill in Strichen, Aberdeenshire, where she once reared rare Muscovy ducks.\nShe is said to have been defiant about the allegations against her husband, furious that former allies and colleagues turned against him in a case that ultimately resulted in his acquittal on all charges. Yet, now 82, she remained in Strichen during his court appearances, appearing only once by his side on the final day of his trial in Edinburgh. Instead, Salmond\u2019s sisters Gail and Margaret, and his former office manager Isobel Zambonini, accompanied him as he walked into court for hearings.\nRumours circulated for years within the Scottish National party and political circles that Salmond had a series of discreet affairs but it never became a public or political issue.\nAt a press conference in August 2018 Salmond admitted he was no saint, and, as part of his defence, claimed to jurors he had a consensual \u201cliaison\u201d with one complainer and a \u201csleepy cuddle\u201d with another.\nConsistently shy of making public appearances in the UK, Moira has rarely provoked media interest. But there was one notable occasion.\nAs Andy Murray celebrated winning Wimbledon in 2013, she pulled a large saltire from her handbag as she and her husband sat behind the then prime minister, David Cameron, in the royal box. The couple held it high, reportedly to the tennis player\u2019s irritation.\nDuring Salmond\u2019s seven years as first minister, his wife\u2019s official duties in Scotland were rare and off camera. To her apparent delight, she accompanied him on their annual overnight stays with the Queen during her September holidays at Balmoral, but rarely stayed at Bute House, the first minister\u2019s elegant but unhomely official residence in Edinburgh.\nShe was given her own programme of events when she accompanied her husband on his first visit to the US as first minister in 2008, and again on trips in 2011 and 2012 to Dubai, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.\nOut of the public gaze, Moira became a significant presence in the SNP in Aberdeenshire, helping at branch events and fundraisers, taking part in Salmond\u2019s private dinners with newspaper editors, friendly business leaders and political allies.\nShe has been his guide, confidante and at times, political strategist. Salmond told one interviewer in 2007 her influence on him was \u201cvery substantial. She tells me not to take myself too seriously.\u201d One observer recalls Salmond cadging a cigarette at a party event and pleading like a naughty child: \u201cDon\u2019t tell Moira.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-363": {"text": "Haunted By The Miserable Ghost\nI still think back to that night in mid-May this year: scrutineering in some far-flung warehouse in suburban Melbourne, running down my phone battery to check seat-by-seat results, as it dawned on us that \u2013 seemingly against the laws of political gravity \u2013 Scott Morrison had pulled it off.\nNobody had loathed Morrison\u2019s predecessor more than I had, but even I\u2019d underestimated the way in which the Liberal party\u2019s vote would be boosted by blasting Malcolm Turnbull out. I shouldn\u2019t have, though, because there was a precedent. And so now, as we approach the tenth anniversary of the 2009 leadership spill, on the first of December, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the first time that the Liberal party vanquished its miserable ghost \u2013 and with him, the Coalition\u2019s electorally-poisonous climate change policy.\nI still remember where I was on that day, too. Crammed into a hot office at some summer internship, hitting refresh on one of the first crude versions of Twitter until I and every other long-suffering conservative were delivered a miracle, long before that word had entered the Australian political lexicon. Tony Abbott had defeated Turnbull by a single vote.\nNaturally, no sooner had he stepped out of the party room, Abbott was written off. Labor couldn\u2019t believe their luck, safe in their misguided certainty that Tony Abbott would never, ever be prime minister. And then the first polls came in, showing that after years of being in the toilet, the Coalition\u2019s vote had recovered. Then another good poll came in. And another. And before long it was clear that under Tony Abbott, the Liberal party was back in business.\nBut the Abbott ascendency meant more than just a sugar hit in the polls. It meant that Kevin Rudd\u2019s emissions trading scheme was dead, buried and cremated. And, more to the point, it meant that the cosy duopoly between the major parties on global warming had been shattered forever.\nUnder Turnbull, an emissions trading scheme of some kind had been a fait accompli. The only \u2018debate\u2019 was how the whole monstrosity was supposed to actually work. When it came to climate change, all we got from the press gallery were the finer details, breathless reporting on what happened in that day\u2019s haggling between Penny Wong and \u2013 for his sins \u2013 Ian Macfarlane.\nWe were bombarded \u2013 bamboozled \u2013 with a flood of useless detail that only a government led by Kevin Rudd could generate. Endless speculation of who was in, who was out, who was exempt and who would have to cop it. Endless warnings of how the \u2018rest of the world is acting\u2019 (they weren\u2019t) and how terribly upset everyone would be with us if Kevin Rudd didn\u2019t front up to Copenhagen with an emissions trading scheme signed, sealed and delivered.\nEndless talk of carbon credits, carbon permits, carbon reporting, carbon farming, carbon sequestration and carbon accounting. This was Australia in 2009, a country consumed by the bureaucratic minutiae, the swarm of trivialities, that came with the absurd task of regulating an element of the periodic table.\nWhat the chattering classes didn\u2019t understand is that most Australians saw through it, and knew instinctively that it was a bad idea. With Tony Abbott\u2019s ascension to the leadership, they were awakened. And all it took for Tony Abbott to bring the whole grotesque Jenga tower of stupidity crashing down was seven words: Kevin Rudd\u2019s ETS was nothing more, and nothing less than \u2018a great big new tax. On everything\u2019.\nWhy is any of this relevant now? Because even to this day, the Liberal party refuses to learn from its successes. For one thing, it took less than six years for 54 Liberal MPs to suffer from such a severe bout of political amnesia that they handed the keys to the Ferrari (and the Lodge) back to the kid who had crashed it.\nBut more importantly, both disastrous incarnations of the Turnbull experiment debunk the great electoral myth that climate change is some kind of barbecue-stopper in middle Australia. As his leadership melted down in 2009, Malcolm Turnbull had famously declared that \u2018I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am\u2019 (a declaration which, incidentally, turned out to the most prescient thing he ever said). His second stint was not much different, as Turnbull\u2019s obsession with emissions reduction \u2013 this time by stealth via the NEG \u2013 pushed his colleagues too far.\nThe \u2018miracle\u2019 victory of 2019 should have been the end of the matter. Bill Shorten ran hard on climate change and bombed, while \u2013 by the Left\u2019s own admission \u2013 the \u2018climate election\u2019 was won by a party with \u2018no climate policy\u2019. In fact, Australians have said no to \u2018climate action\u2019 at every electoral opportunity \u2013 save for 2007 when the afterglow of Al Gore\u2019s An Inconvenient Truth was such that even John Howard went to the election promising an emissions trading scheme.\nIt isn\u2019t just Australians who reward politicians going against the climate zeitgeist. Donald Trump bucked similar predictions to Scott Morrison, won the 2016 election and promptly withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement. And even in luvvie Ontario, Doug Ford was elected premier on a platform of scrapping the Canadian province\u2019s carbon tax.\nBut even after all that, the Coalition\u2019s habit of doffing its hat to climate alarmism stubbornly persists. One recent example is the inexplicable decision to pump a cool billion dollars into the Gillard-era Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Meanwhile, although Tony Abbott scuttled the widely-loathed carbon tax, the Coalition has left almost every other aspect of Labor\u2019s grotesque green energy apparatus intact \u2013 like the souped-up renewable energy target that has lined the pockets of \u2018clean energy\u2019 carpetbaggers while middle Australia pays through the nose.\nThere is a reason why Malcolm Turnbull was embraced by the basket-weavers of Bondi and was electoral poison everywhere else. Ten years on, the Morrison government should look back and remember what happens when the Coalition looks beyond the climate bubble.", "label": 1}, "text-364": {"text": "Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney (D-Salem) admitted defeat in his and Gov. Kate Brown\u2019s attempt to force unwilling Republicans to vote on a controversial cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nCourtney called for the walkout to end after more than a week of contentious actions at the state capitol. First, Republicans had walked out en masse to deny the Senate a quorum to vote on the bill; second, Brown directed the state police to seize Senate Republicans and deliver them to the capitol to allow a vote; third, some Republican senators left the state to get beyond the jurisdiction of the state police; fourth, the governor closed the capitol on the recommendation of state police as protestors who supported the Republican walkout showed up and threatened to take over the building; and fifth, Courtney announced the bill is dead for now and asked Republicans to come back to work on other matters.\nOregon\u2019s cap-and-trade bill, H.B. 2020, was modeled after California climate legislation. Under the bill the state would replace its current greenhouse gas reduction goals\u2014goals it is projected to miss, demonstrating the difficulty of reaching even more modest emission reductions\u2014with an emissions limit that tightens each year, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\nThe bill would require companies emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually to purchase \u201callowances\u201d every year for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit. The state would reduce the supply of allowances auctioned each year, with the tighter supply resulting in higher auction prices. This is intended to encourage businesses that can reduce emissions more cheaply than by purchasing allowances to do so. The state admits the rising costs of allowances or switching to less-emitting technologies will likely cause energy prices to increase.\nDemocrats\u2019 supermajority in the Oregon House enabled them to steamroll Republicans and easily pass H.B. 2020. Oregon\u2019s 30-member Senate is made up of 18 Democrats and 11 Republicans, with one open seat. Although Senate Democrats have close to a supermajority, the law requires a quorum of 20 senators to be present in order to vote on legislation. To prevent Courtney from calling a vote on the bill, Republicans walked out.\nIn the run-up to the legislative standoff, The Heartland Institute was at the forefront of the fight against H.B. 2020, arguing in papers and testimony before the legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Carbon Reduction that the cap-and-trade bill would increase the price Oregon\u2019s residents and businesses pay for energy, making the state less competitive economically, resulting in job loses, and hurting the poor especially.\nHeartland Institute Policy Analyst Tim Benson testified that where cap-and-trade programs have been tried, as in California and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern states, they have raised consumers\u2019 costs for no climate benefit.\n\u201cThe Alliance of Western Energy Consumers (AWEC) submitted material to the Joint Committee on Carbon Reduction stating the proposed cap-and-trade program would be responsible for \u2018cumulative compliance and energy cost impacts\u2019 exceeding $350 million by 2030 and more than $1.5 billion in 2040 for their members, who employ more than 50,000 Oregonians in industries such as \u2018agriculture, aeronautics, air products, pulp and paper, food processing, information technology, health care and more,\u2019\u201d Benson testified. \u201cThe submission concludes that the \u2018economic impacts and job losses to AWEC members and communities will likely be significant as a result of [cap-and-trade], as production in these facilities is curtailed and shifted to lower cost states.\u2019\u201d\nCapping emissions in Oregon to fight climate change would be foolish, John Charles, president of Oregon\u2019s Cascade Policy Institute, told Fox 12 TV.\n\u201cThis is probably the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire career,\u201d said Charles. \u201cIt is a tax, it will make gasoline immediately about 20 cents per gallon more expensive\u2014dollars more expensive in decades to come.\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to take one for the global team, and no benefits?\u201d Charles said. \u201cAnd pay all the costs? That\u2019s insanity. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nSenate Republicans evidently agreed, fleeing the capitol and in some instances even the state to avoid being forced to allow a vote on the plan.\nBefore abandoning the Senate, Republicans requested their Democratic colleagues allow Oregonians to directly vote on the cap-and-trade plan via a referendum, as voters in Washington State did when they twice rejected a carbon tax many in its legislature favored. Democrats rejected the idea.\nHistorically, both Democrats and Republicans have walked out during legislative sessions to prevent laws from getting a vote or to obtain concessions. \u00a0This was the second time Senate Republicans in Oregon walked out during the 2019 legislative session. Republicans walked out a few weeks ago in opposition to a multibillion-dollar business tax. That walkout ended when Brown agreed to kill bills involving vaccines and gun control.\nBrown escalated the conflict when, at Courtney\u2019s request, she directed the state police to round up Republican lawmakers and deliver them to the Senate to cement a quorum.\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that the Senate Republicans would turn their back on their constituents who they are honor-bound to represent here in this building,\u201d Brown said when announcing she had called in the state police. \u201cThey need to return and do the jobs they were elected to do.\u201d\nSenate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr. (Grants Pass) responded with his own statement, saying his caucus was defending constituents\u2019 interests by preventing a vote.\n\u201cThis is the only tool we have to put pressure on what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Baertschiger, in a statement. \u201cProtesting cap-and-trade by walking out today represents our constituency and exactly how we should be doing our job.\n\u201cWe have endured threats of arrest, fines. \u2026 We will not stand by and be bullied by the majority party any longer,\u201d Baertschiger said.\nWhile some legislators left the state to get beyond the reach of Oregon law enforcement, others, such as state senator and decorated veteran Brian Boquist (R-Dallas), stayed at home and seemingly vowed to fight state police should they come.\n\u201cSend bachelors and come heavily armed,\u201d Boquist reportedly told Travis Hampton, superintendent of the Oregon State Police, according to the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\nA day after the walkout, supporters of the move began protesting outside the capitol. After anti-government groups, including the Oregon Three Percenters, who had participated in an armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016, announced they would be joining the protests inside the building, Brown closed the capitol.\nA couple of Democratic senators indicated to Courtney they would join Republicans in voting against the bill if it were taken up. With no end of the walkout in sight and just days left in a legislative session with more than 100 bills yet to be voted upon, Courtney signaled defeat on the cap-and-trade bill. Saying he was not sure he had the votes to pass H.B. 2020 even within his own caucus, Courtney announced on June 25 the cap-and-trade bill would not go forward in this session.\n\u201cWhat I'm about to say I say of my own free will,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cNo one has told me to say this, \u2026 H.B. 2020 does not have the votes on the Senate floor. That will not change.\n\u201cPlease, senators, come to this floor,\u201d said Courtney.\nWhether Republicans will heed Courtney\u2019s request is unclear, as some senators have indicated they fear Courtney\u2019s announcement might be a ploy by which they show up and he calls a vote on the bill.\nNPR cites state Sen. Tim Knopp (R-Bend) as one who may continue to sit out the legislative session unless Courtney offers some guarantees.\n\u201cWe need clarification. What does that mean?\u201d Knopp told NPR. \u201cDoes it mean it\u2019s dead until the 2020 session?

Confounding these predictions, a recent paper published in the Journal of Arid Environments finds just the opposite is occurring. The Namib Desert is gaining moisture, and plant life is expanding\nComparing more than 100 historical photos of Namibia and the Namib Desert to new photos taken at the same sites, researchers from the University of Edinburgh and the University of Cape Town found woody plant growth has increased over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This corresponds to data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System from 1948 through 2017 which reveals the number of days with moisture has increased across the region.\nAs a result, the \u201chyper-arid\u201d area between Namibia\u2019s coastal \u201cFogbelt\u201d and its inland savanna is shrinking as woody growth expands.\n\u201cT]hese findings \u2026 are at variance with regional climate model forecasts that project widespread aridification,\u201d the researchers write.\nSOURCE: Journal of Arid Environments (behind paywall)\nA push by most European Union nations for the world\u2019s biggest economic trading block to commit to going carbon-neutral by 2050 failed on June 15 over objections about the impact on the cost and supply of energy.\nUnder the Paris climate agreement, the EU pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions across the trading bloc by 40 percent below its 1990 levels by 2030.\nIn the EU\u2019s last scheduled negotiations before the next climate summit in September, France and Germany pushed the 28-member EU to set an ambitious new climate goal of becoming carbon dioxide emission neutral by 2050. This would require either sharp reductions in carbon dioxide emissions or undertaking steps to remove from the atmosphere the equivalent of the amount of carbon dioxide any EU country emits.\nEU estimated member states would have to invest an additional 175 billion to 290 billion euros per year in clean energy technology to meet the net-zero goal. Unanimity was needed among the EU countries to adopt those goals. With no clear plan for how the investments would be financed or how the costs would be divided, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland said no.\nLacking the consensus needed to adopt the net-zero goal, the EU instead added a footnote to its official statement, saying, \u201cFor a large majority of member states, climate neutrality must be achieved by 2050.\u201d\nSOURCES: CNN; Reuters", "label": 1}, "text-365": {"text": "Mike Ashley's Frasers Group snaps up stake in luxury brand Mulberry\nMike Ashley has bought a 12.5% stake in the luxury British handbag company Mulberry as he seeks to push his retail empire upmarket.\nAshley\u2019s Fraser Group announced on Monday that it had bought the shareholding as a part of a \u201ckey strategic priority\u201d to reposition his fashion group towards \u201cpremium third-party brands\u201d. The sale price was not disclosed but based on Friday\u2019s share price, when the transaction took place, it would have been worth just under \u00a319m.\nThe Sports Direct tycoon has been expanding his retail empire with a string of acquisitions of struggling retailers, including the department store chain House of Fraser for \u00a390m, Jack Wills, Evans Cycles, Sofa.com and Game Digital.\nThe expansion led Ashley to rename the company, ditching the Sports Direct International name for Frasers Group in December. The name change followed criticism from politicians and investors over working conditions at Sports Direct and the standard of corporate governance at the wider group.\nMulberry is by far the most upmarket investment for Ashley\u2019s stable, which also includes Flannels, Lillywhites, Donnay, Slazenger, Kangol, Karrimor, Lonsdale and a 26% stake in French Connection.\nMulberry bags can easily exceed \u00a31,000.

Mulberry is a real luxury operation, although there is some synergy with House of Fraser.\u201d\nAshley has appointed his future son-in-law Michael Murray as head of elevation in a bid to secure a more high-end reputation. Murray is not on the company\u2019s board, or even an employee, but is employed as a consultant, paid 25% of any value he creates from property deals \u2013 a formula that has resulted in Sports Direct giving Murray more than \u00a310.5m in the past two years.\nFrasers and Mulberry declined to state the price of the stake sale.

She and her teammates were equally intent on exposing the game of rugby sevens to the rest of the world and doing their best to inspire a new generation of girls to pick up an oval-shaped ball.\nFast forward three years, and with the Tokyo Games just 12 months away, things have changed for the 24-year-old from Brisbane \u2013 and the sport. After Australia secured that gold medal when the sport made its debut appearance at the Games in Brazil, sevens is on an upward trajectory, and Pelite can allow herself to concentrate fully on winning back-to-back Olympic titles in Japan.\n\u201cWe did our job in Rio in establishing rugby sevens not only as a male-dominated sport, but a female sport,\u201d Pelite tells Guardian Australia. \u201cYou\u2019ve got young girls that now understand rugby sevens and that there\u2019s a pathway to becoming an Olympic rugby sevens player.\n\u201cWe came out with that goal. Winning the gold medal was amazing for us, but this year the pressure of having won that gold medal \u2013 and now having to back it up \u2013 has shifted the focus.\u201d\nPelite, who took up the game only after transitioning from touch football at the late age of 17, sees herself as something of a pioneer in a sport that has struggled for mainstream exposure, despite a long and storied history dating back to its roots in 19th century Scotland. The women\u2019s game in particular has emerged into the spotlight only relatively recently, helped largely by its inclusion as an Olympic sport for the first time in Rio \u2013 and the subsequent feats of Pelite and her teammates.\nThe men\u2019s game was included in the Commonwealth Games for the first time in 1998, but women had to wait to make their debut until last year on the Gold Coast, where the tournament proved a huge success even if it ended in gut-wrenching defeat for Pelite and Australia in the final against New Zealand.\n\u201cSevens is definitely on the up,\u201d Pelite says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always looked at sevens being the front runner for women\u2019s sport \u2013 we were one of the first to become full-time professional [female] athletes in Australia; we also last year got pay parity with the men. I feel sevens is really driving the standards for women\u2019s sports in Australia at the moment.\u201d\nThe number of athletes Australia dispatches to Tokyo may eclipse the contingent of 482 sent to Athens in 2004, to date the most sent to an overseas Games. And next year will be Australia\u2019s most gender-balanced Games in Olympic history, with women making up 49% of the athletes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing for young girls to be able to look up and know that there\u2019s an equal opportunity for them to represent Australia in an Olympics and to know women are competing for 50% of the medal tally,\u201d Pelite says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing recognition for the hard work the girls put in.\u201d\nPelite understands her position as a role model to young people across Australia and the world, an honour she does not take lightly. \u201cWe all know being in the limelight you\u2019re going to have to promote it in a positive way,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are always people watching you \u2013 grown men and women, but also young women and boys \u2013 that also have aspiration. We can show them that hard work does pay off. Five years ago, I would never have imagined I\u2019d be an Olympian now, so anything is possible.\u201d\nThe women\u2019s sevens team is one three Australian teams, along with artistic swimming and men\u2019s archery, to have secured their place in Tokyo. The next 12 months will be spent preparing for a tilt at a second consecutive Olympic gold medal, and with nine members of the squad remaining from 2016, they have the experience to know how to go about it.\nBut there is something else spurring them on: the disappointment of that epic Commonwealth final defeat at Robina Stadium last year, when Australia lost to New Zealand\u2019s golden-point try deep into extra-time. \u201cThat was a heartbreaking loss,\u201d Pelite says. But despite the heartache, a year on she is able to see the positives from what was a fantastic advert for the game and women\u2019s sport.\n\u201cAs hard as it was to lose that gold medal to New Zealand, it was amazing for us to showcase what rugby sevens is. It was one of the best sevens finals you could have asked for,\u201d she says. \u201cAs much as it hurts my heart to lose, we\u2019re still pioneers for the sport and still have to put on a good show for everyone.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-368": {"text": "Stop smoking campaign in England axed after health budget cuts\nThe government has been accused of undermining its ambition to make England smoke free after an anti-smoking campaign was cancelled following a 24% cut to the public health marketing budget.\nHealth Harms, a Public Health England (PHE) scheme, has previously sought to harness new year resolutions in January to encourage the 6 million tobacco smokers in the country to quit through vaping and visualising how cancer-causing chemicals and tar are inhaled.\nRates of smoking are declining, also thanks to the introduction of plain packaging and tax increases, but the government has been urged not to be \u201ccomplacent\u201d after it emerged the overall anti-smoking budget had been reduced to \u00a33.8m from \u00a35m.\nThe move came after PHE\u2019s marketing budget was cut by a fifth earlier this year, from about \u00a335m to \u00a328m.\n\u201cSlashing budgets for these campaigns is a foolhardy decision which not only lets down smokers who are looking to quit but will also result in further pressure on the NHS due to smoking-related illnesses,\u201d warned British Lung Foundation\u2019s (BLF) senior policy officer Rachael Hodges.\n\u201cAlthough smoking rates are declining, we must not be complacent.

If we give them the chance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released a report detailing how great whales could sequester billions of tonnes of climate-threatening carbon from the atmosphere.\nIt is an exquisite and painful irony. In the 20th century, humans removed 3 million great whales from the oceans \u2013 their sublime beauty hunted, slaughtered, and processed. It was a terrible loss twice over, since scientists believe that the subtraction of this vast marine biomass may have hastened climate breakdown, not least by removing billions of tonnes of whale faeces that would have fertilised phytoplankton, which in turn would capture carbon released by human activities.\nNow the international (if voluntary) moratorium on the hunting of great whales, implemented in 1986, is finally bearing fruit and some populations are recovering. There are even humpbacks off the coast of New York.\nSo, being human \u2013 we bring in the accountants. In its cost-benefit analysis, the IMF reports that if whales are allowed to return to their pre-whaling population estimate of 4 million to 5 million \u2013 from slightly more than 1.3 million today \u2013 they would capture as much carbon annually as four Amazon forests. Not only that, they make money for us: whale watching, as a relatively benign alternative to whale hunting, is worth $2bn globally, a year.

But isn\u2019t it too late to stop the climate crisis?We are definitely running late. We have delayed appallingly for decades. But science tells us we are still in the nick of time.\nYou say this decade is the most consequential in human history\u2026This is the decade in which, contrary to everything humanity has experienced before, we have everything in our power. We have the capital, the technology, the policies. And we have the scientific knowledge to understand that we have to half our emissions by 2030.\nSo we are facing the most consequential fork in the road. If we continue as now, we are going to be irreparably going down a course of constant destruction, with much human pain and biodiversity loss. Or we can choose to go in the other direction, a path of reconstruction and regeneration, and at least diminish the negative impacts of climate change to something that is manageable.\nBut we can only choose it this decade. Our parents did not have this choice, because they didn\u2019t have the capital, technologies and understanding. And for our children, it will be too late. So this is the decade and we are the generation.\nOnly 11 pages or so of the book describe the terrible consequences of unchecked climate change, while the rest talks about the possibility of a much better world. Why?It\u2019s important for everyone to face the negative consequences that we\u2019re sleepwalking ourselves toward, which is why those 11 pages are there. But equally as important is to spark the imagination and the creativity that comes with understanding that we do have this incredible agency to create something completely different.\nWe wanted to offer both universes to those who, understandably, are paralysed by despair and grief at the loss that is already under way, as well as those who are paralysed by their comfort and lack of understanding of the moment that we\u2019re in.\nA lot of the book is about the need for a shift in people\u2019s consciousness. Isn\u2019t this rather grandiose or, on the other hand, too vague to make a difference in the real world?Whatever we hold as being possible, and whatever values and principles we live by, determine the actions that we take. Whatever we hold to be near and dear to us is what we\u2019re willing to work toward. And so to shift from doom and gloom to a positive, optimistic, constructive attitude is very important because it is what gets us up in the morning and says \u201cyes, we can do this, we\u2019re going to work together on that\u201d, rather than pulling the blanket over our head and saying \u201cit\u2019s all too difficult\u201d. So that change in attitude inside ourselves is critical.\nWe also have to understand that we can no longer live in a world based on limitless extraction and waste. Rather, we have to change our consciousness to one of regeneration.\nHow can people\u2019s consciousness change in that way?The first thing we have to understand is the consequence of not changing our attitudes. There are very serious existential consequences. Then hopefully we can make a serious, mature decision whether we want to choose something different.\nOne of the 10 actions recommended in the book is to be a citizen and not a consumer. Can you explain that and why it is important?The very concept of being a consumer already points us in the direction of consuming irresponsibly. We have to be able at some point, particularly in developed countries, to get to the point where we say \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Before you make a purchase, or an investment, or any kind of decision that impacts on the planet and on other people, the question should be: \u201cDo I really need this and is this actually conducive to furthering the quality of life on this planet?\u201d\nAnother of the actions you chose is building gender equality. Why?Educating young women and empowering women to come to decision-making tables is the strongest thing that we can do for the climate. When there are more women in boardrooms and in high-level positions in institutions, you get decisions that are wiser and longer term.\nOf course there are many men that also do this. But there is a tendency for women to be more collaborative, which is the basis of what we need to do, and they tend to think much more long term. [Women] have the first duty of care of our newborn children and hence, biologically, we\u2019re geared towards that stewardship. But it is just plain stupid, frankly, not to use 50% of human potential. We are in such an emergency that we need to deploy 100% of our potential.\nTackling the climate emergency requires global cooperation and action by governments and businesses. But what can individuals do?We tend to forget that it is humans who have caused climate change, and we tend to export responsibility to large corporations or governments. The fact is, we all contributed to it.\nIf we all reduce our emissions, collectively we give a signal to the market. Obviously, corporations have their own responsibilities but it\u2019s helpful to have a strong demand from the public. Once you get governments, corporations and the public moving in the same direction towards low carbon, it can grow exponentially [such as with renewable energy and electric cars].\nPeople reducing their emissions \u2013 by flying less, eating less meat and using clean energy, for example \u2013 is important.\nBut is demanding that politicians tackle the climate emergency and voting accordingly perhaps the most important thing individuals can do?I would say both. If we had 50 years to fiddle with this, then you could choose one or the other. But we are in such an emergency that we can no longer do things sequentially or exclusively. We have to be an \u201cand/also\u201d world.\n\u2022 The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac is published by Manilla Press (\u00a312.99).

In the half century since, climate change has emerged as an existential global threat.\nBut there are still reasons to be hopeful \u2013 and this week, the Guardian is joining forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency, from electric cars to fighting plastic waste to using psychedelic drugs. (Michael Pollan will weigh in.) We\u2019ll also explore lessons from the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 and whether the economic crash could create opportunities to rebuild a greener economy.\nThe Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded last year by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation to address the urgent need for stronger climate coverage. More than 400 newsrooms from around the world \u2013 with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people \u2013 have signed on.\nIn the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we\u2019ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week.\nThe Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world.\nThe Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian announced it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels. Last year, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favors the terms \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and \u201cclimate emergency\u201d over \u201cclimate change\u201d.\nThe Guardian last year also began putting global CO2 levels in the daily weather forecast in its print publication.\nCovering Climate Now was launched to address a glaring failure by the media to meet the urgency of the climate emergency. Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, \u201cbroadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth\u201d.\nIn 2019, that started to change. \u201cThe climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,\u201d Pope writes. \u201cFloods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.\u201d\nWhile the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

He doesn\u2019t wear a tie, he\u2019s on Instagram and he\u2019s going to shrink its carbon footprint to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050. Is this for real?\nIt\u2019s a sign the tide is turning. Maybe not enough to save us from catastrophic sea-level rises, but a turn nonetheless. The oil industry is incredibly savvy when it comes to public opinion, and can see the steady erosion of its \u201csocial licence to operate\u201d (a company\u2019s ability to go about its business without too much challenge). It has been struggling to recruit young people for years, well before the school climate strikes started.\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company and National Galleries Scotland have both turned their back on BP sponsorship in recent months, and last weekend more than a thousand people turned up at the British Museum to protest at the firm\u2019s involvement there.\nBP is not the first oil company to give itself a lick of green paint to appear more acceptable in this era of increasing climate concern. We\u2019ve seen Statoil dropping the word \u201coil\u201d with the refreshed identity of Equinor, and Dong (Danish Oil and Natural Gas) relaunched as the renewable energy company \u00d8rsted. It\u2019s hard to see Equinor as anything more than greenwash while it\u2019s still drilling the Arctic, but \u00d8rsted may yet become the world\u2019s first green energy supermajor, betting on the power of offshore wind to eventually see off natural gas. Shell is also keen to show off its green credentials, as anyone who has seen its multimillion pound advertising campaign can tell. It\u2019s scared, or it wouldn\u2019t bother.\nBP has been here before, with a \u00a3100m \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d rebrand in the early noughties. Alongside a new sunflower logo, this emphasised the company\u2019s commitment to wind, solar and biofuels alongside oil and gas, but renewables remained a small part of its portfolio. Clean energy is good for press photos, but not really central to BP\u2019s core business model. Environmentalist Jonathon Porritt originally tried to engage in its initiatives, but turned away in disgust, declaring it was impossible for today\u2019s oil majors to change at the radical speed required.\nIf BP is serious about rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, it will have to go the extra mile to convince us. It\u2019s one thing for a computer company to make bold claims on climate action (as Microsoft did last month, announcing it would be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by 2030), but it\u2019s another for an oil major. And yet, so far, Looney\u2019s new vision is light on specifics. Apparently we have to wait until September for the details, but it does seem clear that BP will still be selling oil and gas.\nBP seems to be banking on the \u201cnet\u201d in net zero doing a lot of heavy lifting. Which leaves the rather basic question: how does it plan to balance out carbon emissions produced by burning fossil fuels? Trees are great for helping us mop up some of the damage we\u2019ve already caused, and various other technological options might turn out to be useful on a small scale. Capturing carbon from the air and using it to make plastic; adding iron to the ocean to speed up its ability to absorb carbon; or genetically modifying trees so they have larger, carbon-sucking roots, for example. But a lot of this is still a bit sci-fi, and none of it is ever likely to soak up the quantities of oil and gas BP plans to keep selling.\nLooney says he wants to help the world to get to net zero, not just BP. It is, apparently, shutting down the \u201cPossibilities Everywhere\u201d ad campaign that showcased its (relatively small-scale) work on clean energy, instead funnelling resources into campaigns that foster \u201cthe right kind of change\u201d.\nThis is the part of the project we should perhaps be most wary of. It\u2019s worth remembering that with the Beyond Petroleum push in the noughties, BP popularised the idea of a \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d. The approach seemed to mean well but was effective at individualising the causes of climate crisis, pulling attention away from the sorts of large-scale change that would really challenge the fossil fuel companies.\nBeware oil execs in environmentalists\u2019 clothing. They may simply wish to seize the growing energy for change and steer it towards their own ends: the continued burning of fossil fuels.\nThe most offensively disingenuous idea at the heart of this flashy new strategy is that BP finally \u201cgets\u201d the climate crisis. Oil runs off many things, and one of them is strong science. Fossil fuel companies have long known their business was dangerous and yet they chose to keep profiting off it. Indeed, new data shows quite how much they profited ($332bn in the last three decades in the case of BP). BP hasn\u2019t suddenly got a dose of the climate heebie-jeebies, it\u2019s just worried that, finally, you have.\nThe Instagramming, tie-free Looney might reflect a new phase in the oil business, but is it still business as usual underneath? It\u2019s hard not to see the rhetorical use of the \u201cnet\u201d in net zero as a bit of smoke and mirrors, a way of making it sound as if it is taking the crisis seriously while avoiding the simple truth: we need to stop burning fossil fuels.\nIf BP really wants us to believe that a company that made its name in oil can be part of the solution, it needs to stop drilling. It\u2019s as simple as that. Hold retirement parties for refineries and retrain workers for a zero-carbon future, and do it fast. That might actually be something worth Instagramming about.\n\u2022 Alice Bell is co-director at the climate change charity Possible", "label": 0}, "text-375": {"text": "carbon conquers famine (but green zealots can let it loose again)\n\"Greens are inviting famine, humanity\u2019s ancient enemy, into our cities via the green door,\" writes Viv Forbes, in the \"Carbon Sense Newsletter\":.", "label": 1}, "text-376": {"text": "Boris Johnson's reshuffle: who's in, who's out, at a glance\nBoris Johnson is carrying out the first major reshuffle of his ministers since being elected prime minister in December.\nSajid Javid\nThe first chancellor from a Muslim background was a significant appointment for the Conservative party last summer. He has allegedly stood down after being told all his special advisers would be sacked and replaced with No 10 advisers, who would be under the control of Downing Street. He was a home secretary under Theresa May and led the government\u2019s public apology over the Windrush scandal. His time as business secretary under David Cameron was marred by his reaction to the Redcar steel crisis, and, embarrassingly, he was ordered to cut short a holiday to Australia to deal with the issue.\nHe stood on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb in 2016 to replace Cameron and the then chancellor, George Osborne, and launched his own bid to lead the party in 2019. He was knocked out of the race halfway through the rounds of voting. \nJulian Smith\nThe Northern Ireland secretary was initially rumoured to be for the chop after being difficult over Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy in the autumn. However, he was widely thought to have gained a reprieve after securing the return of Stormont. A former chief whip and May ally, it seems he was never quite trusted by Team Johnson. No 10 sources briefed that he had irritated the prime minister over plans to allow soldiers to be prosecuted over actions in the Troubles, even though this was subject to full cabinet agreement. His sacking is likely to be greeted with dismay in Northern Ireland, where he was regarded as a very good secretary of state with a grip on complex problems.\nA former businessman, Smith was perhaps best known for demanding the Guardian be prosecuted over the Edward Snowden revelations before May elevated him to the cabinet. He has represented the safe North Yorkshire seat of Skipton and Ripon since 2010 and now returns to the backbenches.\nAndrea Leadsom\nThe former Tory leadership contender has lost her role as business secretary, having served in cabinet jobs since 2016. The former business executive was a significant figure by the end of the May government, becoming leader of the Commons and enjoying fiery exchanges with the then Speaker, John Bercow.\nColleagues have praised her personal drive in rolling out better reporting strategies in cases of bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons. As secretary of state for business and previously environment, however, she has not counted many successes. Preparing companies for Brexit and helping them withstand new customs checks will be a major focus for the government for the next few months and Johnson is expected to install someone he considers to be a \u201cbig hitter\u201d.\nEsther McVey\nThe Brexiter and cheerleader of blue-collar Conservatism, who has lost her role as housing minister, has been no stranger to entering and exiting ministerial jobs, or parliament, over the years. The GMTV presenter turned politician was elected in 2010 for Wirral West and lost her seat in 2015 to Labour\u2019s Margaret Greenwood. In that time she enjoyed a high profile for a new MP, serving as a minister at the Department for Work and Pensions working under Iain Duncan Smith as he rolled out the controversial welfare overhaul universal credit.\nShe won Osborne\u2019s former seat, Tatton, in 2017 and in her comeback to parliament she was promoted to secretary of state for work and pensions under May. She received significant criticism for misleading parliament over universal credit, after telling MPs that the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster. In her apology, she said it had been inadvertent. In 2019 she launched her own bid to be leader of the Conservatives with little success and was knocked out in the first round. Her partner is fellow Tory MP Philip Davies.\nGeoffrey Cox\nThe attorney general with a booming voice and loquacious manner has been relieved of his position. No 10 sources had briefed that he fell out of favour after being condescending in cabinet and was not considered a \u201cteam player\u201d. He will not go short of employment, as before taking the job under May he had a lucrative career as a barrister. Formerly the highest-earning MP, he has acted for companies based in the Cayman Islands and attacked plans for tax havens to be subject to more scrutiny. His most controversial act in government was to refuse to give legal advice saying May\u2019s Brexit deal allowed the UK to exit the Northern Irish backstop. He is also said to have threatened to resign if Johnson had not agreed to write to the EU for an extension to article 50 in the autumn. However, he appears to be still hoping for a government-related role in charge of No 10\u2019s review of the judiciary.\nTheresa Villiers\nAs an MP for 15 years and a prominent Vote Leave campaigner, Villiers is considered one of the most senior female Tory politicians. Yet this wasn\u2019t enough to stop her being shifted out of cabinet by Boris Johnson after just six months as secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Her predecessor, Michael Gove, ignited Defra\u2019s significance as a radical area for policy, which she has not matched. New rules on microchipping cats could be her most stand-out moment. She was also criticised for speaking out in support of fracking when she took up the job, but has been a long-standing critic of Heathrow expansion.\nThe former law lecturer spent her first few years as an MP on Cameron\u2019s frontbench after he appointed her to shadow transport and shadow Treasury briefs. She served as transport minister in the coalition but her most high-profile job was between 2012-16 as Northern Ireland minister where she was one of the longest serving ministers, and on leaving office she said Northern Ireland was in a more politically stable state. Within a year Stormont had collapsed.\nNusrat Ghani\nThe transport minister had been widely tipped for a job overseeing HS2 but was sacked without explanation.\nGeorge Freeman\nTheresa May\u2019s former policy chief is seen as a moderate. He is also out as a transport minister, tweeting that he was sad to be \u201con my bike\u201d.\nChris Skidmore\nThe universities minister is extremely well liked within the party and was tipped for a bigger government job so his sudden sacking was surprising. He tweeted he had been promoted to spend more time with his new baby. \nRishi Sunak\nSunak\u2019s appointment as chancellor is simultaneously less of a surprise than it might have been, given his meteoric rise under Boris Johnson, and more rapid than expected, only happening because of Javid\u2019s sudden departure. The former chief secretary to the Treasury has only been an MP since 2015, and a junior minister since 2018. The MP for Richmond in Yorkshire began under May at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, before joining the Treasury in July last year, when Johnson, who he backed as Tory leader, took over.\nThe former hedge fund manager has since forged a reputation as a media favourite for No 10, sent out on difficult broadcast rounds on a regular basis, where he has the much-coveted ability to talk fluently without ever wandering off message or creating news. An early sign of his rising status was when Sunak was sent out to represent the government in a mass, seven-way TV debate before December\u2019s election.\nThere have been repeated briefings that Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, wanted Sunak as chancellor, but it was felt that Javid could not be removed. Cummings has seemingly got his way.\nA leave supporter, albeit not a hugely militant one, Sunak is seen as hardworking and efficient, and popular in the Treasury, even if he is an occasionally wooden media and parliamentary performer. But above all he is a loyalist, and will not resist the moves to bring the Treasury\u2019s work into the orbit of No 10. The son of a GP and a pharmacist, Sunak went to Winchester public school and Oxford University, then won a Fulbright scholarship to Stanford University in the US. At Stanford he met his wife, Akshata Murthy. She is the daughter of Narayana Murthy, the billionaire co-founder of the Indian technology and consulting corporation Infosys. They have two children.\nBrandon Lewis\nThe former party chair and current security minister will take over as Northern Ireland secretary just as government proposals for the region\u2019s post-Brexit border will come under intense scrutiny. Prior to this significant promotion, Lewis spent more than eight years at ministerial level, covering a range of briefs, from housing to policing. There were rumblings that his call for Johnson to apologise for the comments he made about women wearing burqas back in 2018 might count against him. Clearly not. Nor is the fact that under his watch as party chair, there was a major data breach of ministers\u2019 personal contact details through an app developed for party\u2019s autumn conference.\nAlok Sharma\nThe former international development secretary\u2019s promotion to business secretary and president of the the Cop26 climate talks has proved he is considered a key player in Johnson\u2019s cabinet. As housing minister he took significant criticism for the government\u2019s handling of the Grenfell Tower fire, including a televised meeting with furious residents. Yet his humanity and warmth in the wake of the blaze contrasted sharply with May\u2019s handling of the incident. The former accountant was also an employment minister and foreign minister and served on the Treasury select committee. He worked as a Tory vice-chairman showing the breadth of his work within the party. In 2016 he was appointed infrastructure envoy to India, which is where he lived with his parents until he was five. They moved to Reading in the 1970s.\nOliver Dowden\nThe former paymaster general, nicknamed Olive, gets one of the most loved jobs in government in normal times: secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport. However this is not going to be a whirlwind of arts policy, theatre, broadband and sports announcements. Instead he is most probably being sent into battle against the BBC, with Cummings a known critic of the corporation. His immediate predecessor, Nicky Morgan, has already said the government is \u201copen-minded\u201d about replacing the licence fee. Dowden was Cameron\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan\nTrevelyan was only appointed as a defence minister eight weeks ago, but has got a major upgrade to the cabinet position of international development secretary. The Berwick-upon-Tweed MP is a Johnson loyalist and a member of the Eurosceptic European Research Group. However the long-term future of the Department for International Development is said to be uncertain, with speculation rife it will be moved into the Foreign Office as part of a wider Whitehall shake-up in the coming months.\nGeorge Eustice\nThe Defra minister has been promoted to lead the entire department. He is a long-time ally of Gove and an expert on the UK fishing industry and how EU legislation interplays with UK law. He has been an MP since 2010, previously working as the director of the \u201cno\u201d campaign against the euro, and was head of press for the Tories under Michael Howard. He also served as Cameron\u2019s press secretary when he was leader of the opposition. Coming from a farming background, his family still run an orchard, restaurant and farm shop in Cornwall where they also have a herd of South Devon cattle.\nSuella Braverman\nThe former chair of the European Research Group is an ardent Brexiter and voted against May\u2019s deal three times. She has a Cambridge law degree and a master\u2019s in European and French law from Pantheon-Sorbonne University, in Paris. She was a barrister from 2005-15, specialising in judicial review and immigration cases. Her expertise in judicial review may fit in well with the government\u2019s intended overhaul of the process after a number of court rulings it disagreed with, including the legal fight over the prime minister\u2019s prorogation of parliament and the recent deportation flight of foreign criminals to Jamaica. She was a Brexit minister for 11 months in 2018 and has recently returned to parliament after having her first child last July.\nStephen Barclay\nHe is likely to be a last-minute insert into the cabinet with his appointment as chief secretary to the Treasury, taking over from Sunak following his appointment as chancellor. Barclay took on the role of Brexit secretary under May after the current foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, quit, and has been seen as a dedicated advocate for post-Brexit Britain. Last month his department, DExEU, was scrapped as Britain left the bloc on 31 January and he had been tipped to go to Defra. After a career in finance and banking he became the MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010.\nAmanda Milling\nThe MP for Cannock Chase and deputy chief whip takes on the role of Conservative party chair from James Cleverly. Though largely unknown to the wider public, she is a long-time ally of Johnson and was part of his initial leadership team in 2016 inthe race to replace Cameron. She was among the small group \u2013 with Jake Berry and Ben Wallace \u2013 who were holed up at Johnson\u2019s Oxfordshire cottage shortly after the referendum to plan his campaign strategy.", "label": 0}, "text-377": {"text": "Saving the planet: UK role vital if COP 26 climate talks to succeed\nBoris Johnson\u2019s first steps on the international stage after Brexit will be to hail Britain\u2019s role in forging a new global consensus on the climate crisis \u2013 although he has not yet said who will lead that charge.\nThe UK will host the crunch UN climate talks, COP 26, this November in Glasgow, in what experts say is the last chance for international cooperation on the crisis. The prime minister, in launching the UK\u2019s strategy for the talks on Tuesday, stops short of promising to \u201cget climate done\u201d, but in making his own involvement clear he will at least reassure climate activists and governments concerned at a hitherto confused and chaotic start to the UK\u2019s presidency.\nLate on Friday, the Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings intervened to sack the former minister who had been slated to lead the talks, Claire O\u2019Neill. She was accused of numerous failures in her dealings with officials, her own and those from other countries, and deemed not to have enough clout or persuasion to bring reluctant countries into the fold.\nNo replacement has yet been announced, with rumours swirling of a Whitehall power struggle. The COP 26 unit is within the Cabinet Office, but needs strong relationships with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and with the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. But the confusion over how the talks will be led and managed has left bystanders, including the UN, the EU and other major countries, bemused.\nJohnson\u2019s re-assumption of control was essential, according to Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, and a veteran of the UN talks. \u201cTime is running out fast, but if the prime minister takes an interest and puts his weight behind the required diplomacy, then the UK can still salvage COP 26,\u201d he said.\nThe task ahead is huge. The Paris accord of 2015 marked the first time that rich and poor nations came together resolving to hold global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably 1.5C, which scientists say is the limit of safety. But the Paris pledges to curb carbon emissions are inadequate. This year, governments must scale up their ambition or face climate breakdown within the decade.\nThat effort will reach its climax in Glasgow, but the real work needs to be done now. \u201cIt really is a grind,\u201d said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and ex-UN commissioner for human rights, who has served twice as a UN climate envoy. \u201cI\u2019ve been at those ministerial meetings. You could not believe how boring some of them were. But you need to squeeze the governments, between the bottom-up \u2013 pressure from civil society \u2013 and the top-down [pressure from businesses and political leaders].\u201d\nAccording to Tom Burke, founder of the environmental group E3G, who attended the first ever UN climate COP, the next few months are crucial. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re going to do in September, October; that\u2019s too late. It\u2019s what you\u2019re doing in March and April that will make the difference.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s strategy encompasses all the diplomatic and economic expertise the UK can bring to bear, from ambassadorial schmoozing in capitals from Dhaka to DC, to boardroom influence in major banks. The Prince of Wales and Prince William will also weigh in, with Charles gathering business leaders almost monthly to press them to make changes.\nWhile the UK has an enviable global network of diplomats and \u201csoft power\u201d, it also faces a unique difficulty. Brexit means that even while British representatives are pushing the climate agenda, separate trade negotiators are talking to the same foreign governments \u2013 in some cases even the same people in those governments \u2013 about trade deals. Several experts said they feared it would be difficult to combine the two.\n\u201cCall me sceptical that Boris Johnson\u2019s government will confront Trump\u2019s climate nihilism ahead of Glasgow while simultaneously having to beg him for a post-Brexit trade deal,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House and close observer of COPs. \u201cBoris\u2019s Brexit will have international climate costs, starting with lack of pressure on the US, whose lack of leadership under Trump has allowed an ultra-dangerous global climate backslide.\u201d\nThe US will be tied up with its presidential election this year, and it may yet be possible to forge a deal that the US at least does not object to, even if active participation is unlikely.\nWith regard to the other key country, China, Britain may have to rely on the negotiating might of the EU, which is arranging two major EU-China summits, in March and September, where the climate crisis will have top billing.\nAs the last two decades of UN climate talks have shown, progress can sometimes be made even when big countries are reluctant to play ball. One of the greatest strengths of the UN process is that every country, from poorest to richest, has an equal say, and even the mightiest, from the US and China to the EU and India, have on occasion had to bow to the massed ranks of the poor and vulnerable.\nBuilding the broadest possible coalition is key, according to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, the leading global adviser on energy. \u201cWhat the world needs is a grand coalition. That means governments from around the world, but also industry and civil society.

We simply have to get on with it and equip our farmers and communities with the tools to be able to adapt as best they can\u201d.\nDespite the fact emissions are rising, and have risen every year since the Coalition scrapped the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government, Littleproud said the government was living up to the commitments made under international climate agreements.\nHe was also positive about the role of renewable energy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see 33,000 gigawatts of renewable energy put on in the next year or so. Most of that will happen in my own electorate.\n\u201cWe actually want to become the renewable energy electorate. Western Downs shire is screaming at me to become the renewable energy shire of the country with solar and wind,\u201d the minister said.\nAsked whether he accepted that global warming meant some farms in Australia could become unviable, Littleproud said there was a market-led transition already under way. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen farmers change their practices from being broad-acre back into grazing as the climate\u2019s changed and as that\u2019s taken its toll on its landscape.\u201d\nHe said farmers were already shifting with an eye to long-term viability and the question before government was how to assist people remaining on the land to adapt to changing conditions.\nPressed on what the government\u2019s drought strategy was, because the bulk of a $7bn package the Morrison government points to regularly has not yet been spent, Littleproud said the government was in the process of refining the package with input from significant stakeholders, such as the National Farmers Federation.\nThe minister said he wanted the NFF to provide its strategy so he could \u201cput that in front of cabinet\u201d along with a report from the Joint Agency Drought Taskforce, which was established within the prime minster\u2019s office and led by major general Stephen Day.\nHe said the government was already acting on the recommendations from Day and would continue to work with state governments. Littleproud said what came next needed to extend outside his portfolio to a \u201cwhole of government\u201d response, including health, education and infrastructure.\nThe minister said drought was complex, impacting farmers but also on whole communities. \u201cIt\u2019s not just farmers, it\u2019s the small business owners \u2013 building that infrastructure to build the resilience into the future.\u201d\nLabor last week asked the auditor general to investigate the government\u2019s claimed $7bn in drought assistance, saying the drought response to date had been \u201cad hoc, confusing and lacking in direction\u201d.\nThe former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has declared the Coalition risks \u201cpolitical annihilation\u201d in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams \u2013 but there has also been controversy about the quality of Joyce\u2019s own input as special drought envoy.\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLittleproud was also asked about recent comments from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who declared protesters who disrupt traffic should have their welfare payments cut and be subjected to mandatory jail sentences, part of a rhetoric offensive by conservative MPs against climate change protests.\nLittleproud responded in low-key fashion but broadly backed Dutton\u2019s arguments on Sunday morning. \u201cEveryone wants a cause these days.

We call for an all-out campaign in the UK and internationally to defend Assange, oppose his extradition to the United States, and secure his freedom and return to Australia, with guarantees against any future prosecution.\n\u201cAssange is in grave peril. The US Justice Department has issued a statement claiming that Assange only faces charges that could lead to a prison sentence of up to five years if he has been found guilty. This is a transparent lie, the purpose of which is to facilitate Assange\u2019s extradition and provide the Ecuadorean and British governments with a pretext that they are not turning Assange over to a government that might subject him to torture and execution.\nIf he is transferred to the custody of the United States, anything is possible, including charges of treason that carry a death penalty or indefinite detention as an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d.\nJulian Assange was arrested Thursday morning at the Ecuadorian embassy in London\nAssange has become a target because he did what journalists are supposed to do\u2014expose the truth. Along with Chelsea Manning, who remains in prison for refusing to testify against the WikiLeaks publisher, Assange exposed the crimes that emerged out of wars launched on the basis of lies, which have led to the deaths of more than one million people.\nNew crimes are now being prepared. Even as the conspiracy against Assange was unfolding, Trump was meeting with Al-Sisi, the butcher of Cairo, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was issuing threats against Iran.\nEveryone involved in this crime stands guilty of a monstrous attack on fundamental democratic rights, without even the pretense of due process.\nEcuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno, beset by a domestic crisis provoked by popular opposition to his corrupt administration, and desirous of economic aid offered by the White House, broke Ecuador\u2019s own asylum laws to force Assange out. Its actions are a violation of the honor of Ecuadorean workers, who overwhelmingly support Assange.\nThe UK government, headed by Theresa May, is gloating over Assange\u2019s arrest, issuing statements that are clearly prejudicial to any legal proceedings. When May, speaking to parliament, declared the \u201cwhole house will welcome the news this morning that the Metropolitan police have arrested Julian Assange,\u201d Tory MPs and many Laborites cheered in approval.\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn issued a pro-forma statement declaring that the extradition of Assange \u201cshould be opposed by the British government,\u201d but he kept his mouth shut when May issued her denunciation before parliament and has maintained a silence on Assange during his forced asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy.\nAs for the United States, while the Trump administration is now leading the campaign against Assange, the Democratic Party is solidly behind his persecution, blaming Assange for contributing to the exposure of the crimes for which Hillary Clinton was justly and massively hated. One of the central aims of the Democrats\u2019 anti-Russia campaign has been to justify the attack on WikiLeaks as part of a broader campaign for internet censorship.\nAdded to the list of those responsible is the pseudo-left, the organizations of the upper middle class in the US and internationally, which seized on the initial fraudulent and trumped-up rape allegations against Assange to justify his persecution and their own cowardly abandonment of Assange to American imperialism.\nFor its part, the establishment media, which functions as an arm of the state, has jumped in to support the attack on Assange.\nOn Thursday evening, the editorial boards of the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0issued statements supporting Assange\u2019s extradition. \u201cThe government charged Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, not with publishing classified government information, but with stealing it,\u201d declared the\u00a0New York Times, adding \u201cThe administration has begun well by charging Mr. Assange with an indisputable crime.\u201d\nThe\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0was even more open in its support of the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against Assange, declaring \u201cMr. Assange\u2019s case could conclude as a victory for the rule of law, not the defeat for civil liberties of which his defenders mistakenly warn.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Assange is not a free-press hero,\u201d declares the\u00a0Post. \u201cUnlike real journalists, WikiLeaks dumped material into the public domain.\u201d By the\u00a0Post\u00a0\u2019s definition, the only \u201creal journalists\u201d are those that self-censor at the behest of the Pentagon.\nThese newspapers, which once published the Pentagon Papers, are nothing but apologists for US imperialism. One can only imagine the howls of outrage that would issue from the media if it was the Russian government that had carried out the forcible seizure and arrest of a journalist and critic of its foreign policy!\nIn the seven years of Assange\u2019s confinement in the Ecuadorean embassy, much has changed. Most significant is the eruption of class struggle internationally. It is the fear of the emergence of the class struggle, combined with growing opposition to capitalism, that is compelling the ruling elites to destroy all democratic rights, including the freedom of expression, of which Assange\u2019s persecution is the most grotesque example.\nIn the working class there is overwhelming sympathy for Assange. A dividing line has opened up in social, economic, and political life. The ruling elites are shedding their democratic pretenses. Their media and the pseudo-socialist opposition\u2014the representatives of the politics of the affluent upper-middle-class\u2014function as defenders of the state and the dictatorship of the financial oligarchy.\nIt is the working class, the broad mass of the population, that must be mobilized to defend Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and all class war prisoners. The demand for their freedom must be a rallying cry for the global working class.\nThe\u00a0World Socialist Web Site\u00a0calls on all workers and young people, and all those who uphold democratic rights, to come forward and take an unequivocal stand in defense of Julian Assange.

They were for members of the public and their elected representatives.\u201d\nBut the campaign group BackTo60, which bought the claim on behalf of women affected by the pension changes \u2013 many of whom who only found out their pension age had increased when they applied to draw it, or shortly before \u2013 said they would appeal against the decision.\nJoanne Welch from the group said: \u201cThey can\u2019t knock us back. We\u2019ve got a fierce and powerful armoury behind us. As well as the 3.8 million women affected, we have the support of 215 MPs, Unite, Unison, TUC and others.\n\u201cIf we were a political party, we would be the third biggest, so come on Boris Johnson: you pledged during the Tory leadership campaign that you would look at this issue with fresh vigour. There\u2019s a general election coming up. You need our votes and we are holding you to that undertaking.\u201d\nMarcia Willis Stewart of Birnberg Peirce, which represented the claimants, said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by this decision.\u201d She added that the aim of the \u201carduous legal process\u201d was \u201cto rectify a substantial and far-reaching injustice\u201d.\n\u201cSadly, today that injustice remains,\u201d she said. \u201cThe struggling on behalf of those beleaguered women, whose stories saddened the judges but for whom this judgment provided no relief, will continue.\u201d\nThe shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted: \u201cDisappointed to hear about today\u2019s decision. I will continue to support campaign in their fight against pension inequality.\u201d\nThe Green party MP, Caroline Lucas tweeted: \u201cDeeply disappointing that the courageous and unjustly treated women have lost their judicial review in the high court. The gross pensions injustice for 1950s women remains \u2013 I will continue to support their fight.\u201d\nThe Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, called the judgment \u201cperverse\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a terrible blow for the millions of women who will have been hoping for a very different outcome today. The decision to hike the state pension age with next to no notice didn\u2019t just throw their retirement plans up in the air, it also left many women on lower incomes really struggling to make ends meet.\n\u201cIt seems perverse that the Department for Work and Pensions had no obligation to inform these women of this significant change.\u201d\nThe judgment found that there had been no discrimination by the DWP based on age \u201cbut even if there was, it could be justified on the facts. This legislation operated in the field of macro-economic policy; the underlying objective of the change was to ensure that the state pension regime remained affordable while striking an appropriate balance between state pension age and the size of the state pension; an important consideration was the need to secure intergenerational fairness between pensioners and younger taxpayers; the fact that people live longer is important alongside other demographic and social changes.\u201d\nThe judges also ruled that EU member states were allowed to discriminate on the basis of sex in determining pensionable age. \u201cThere was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law, rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men,\u201d the judgment read.\nThe claimants also argued that they had not had sufficient notice of the changes and that this was contrary to the requirements of public law. This was rejected by the judges because \u201cthe claimants had no legitimate expectation that the government would not alter the state pension age without prior consultation; in any event it was clear that successive governments had engaged in extensive consultation with a wide spread of interested bodies before the legislation was introduced\u201d.\nThe two judges had to consider both UK and EU law, and the UK\u2019s ratification by Margaret Thatcher of the UN convention for the elimination of discrimination against women (CEDAW), which specifies that women who have been discriminated against must be fully compensated.\nWomen in their 50s and 60s were hit by the government\u2019s decision under the 1995 Pensions Act to increase the female state pension age from 60 to 65. The change was to be phased in between 2010 and 2020.\nThe coalition government of 2010 accelerated the timetable. The 2011 Pensions Act brought the new qualifying age of 65 for women forward to 2018. The qualifying age for both men and women will be raised to 66 by October 2020.\nBackTo60 argued that women were not given time to adjust to the new retirement age and also that the changes in 2011 and 1995 had not been clearly communicated.

But most people completely underestimate the importance of sleep. Patients often come in with another complaint, such as anxiety or stress, then when we delve deeper it\u2019s clear that sleep is a big factor to address.\nSleep affects every single organ in the body, from our brains to our stomachs, our sexual organs and our skin. So when we\u2019re not getting enough sleep \u2013 and over half of us have felt stressed from fatigue, according to research from Oxford University [pdf] \u2013 it affects our mental health, digestion, fertility, immune system, mood and more.\nLet\u2019s talk about our brains first. When we don\u2019t sleep well, our amygdala, the emotional part of the brain, is up to 60% more reactive. In other words, we feel anxious, stressed and overreact to everything. But when we sleep well our mood improves, as does our concentration, memory and our ability to process what\u2019s happened in our day. Getting enough sleep can even help protect us against dementia.\nWhen it comes to physical health, I believe we\u2019ve given too much attention to diet and exercise at the cost of sleep. Yet a single night of sleep deprivation can raise levels of the hunger hormone, ghrelin, and reduce the satiety hormone, leptin. So if you\u2019re tired, you constantly feel hungry and never feel satisfied.\nSleep also affects athletic performance, and I don\u2019t mean just Olympians. You can run faster, lift heavier weights and are less likely to get injured after a good night\u2019s sleep. And don\u2019t forget the obvious: sufficient sleep gives us the energy and motivation to exercise.\nOne more really important benefit: a stronger immune system. Night-time is when our bodies repair and restore cells. Sleep is one of the best things you can do to avoid getting a cold, and if you\u2019ve already succumbed to sneezes then sleep is your best route to recovery.\nDr Chatterjee is the author of The Stress Solution\nSo, what can we do to get the sleep we need for a happier, healthier life? We can start from the moment we wake up, by getting outside for 20 minutes of natural daylight. Our circadian rhythm works with contrast in light, so the more daylight you get in the day, the more robust your sleepy phase will be at night.\nSunshine exposes us to 30,000 lux (the measurement of illumination). Even on a cloudy autumn day, you get 10,000 lux. Artificial light cannot compare \u2013 even in a brightly lit office, you\u2019re only exposed 500-1,000 lux. If it\u2019s dark when you\u2019re up in the morning, be sure to get outside for 20 minutes at lunchtime.\nWe have to talk about coffee. Much as I love my coffee, science shows it\u2019s one of the biggest sleep disruptors. The trouble is, the time taken for the body to eliminate one-half of the caffeine is six hours, which means if you\u2019re having a latte to push through your afternoon slump, it\u2019s effectively like having half a coffee at 9pm. My rule is to stick to one or two cups, and enjoy your caffeine before noon. Don\u2019t worry; you\u2019ll depend less on caffeine for your get-up-and-go when sleep gives you energy instead.\nStress is a huge factor, and it has a bidirectional relationship with sleep. Not sleeping well is one of the biggest stressors on the body on a cellular level, and stress is the biggest reason why we can\u2019t sleep. This makes sense to parents, as we know kids need a calming bedtime routine. But we forget that we need to wind down before bed too.\nBefore we discuss how to unwind, let\u2019s bust a big myth. Alcohol does not help us sleep. Alcohol causes sedation, which doesn\u2019t share the same restorative benefits of sleep. In fact, studies show alcohol fragments and dramatically reduces our REM sleep, the critical dream phase. If you like a glass of wine to unwind, you\u2019re better off drinking it straight after work at 6pm than at 10pm.\nYou knew screen time was going to come up too, right? The problem with tech is twofold: blue light from the screen reduces our natural melatonin, the sleepy hormone, and the emotional stimulation of our screen activity keeps us wired. I prescribe a tech-free hour before bed to help you drift off faster and sleep more deeply. But if 60 minutes sounds too much, start with 10. Honestly, even if you think you fall asleep OK after a bedtime burst of emails and social media, you\u2019ll notice you feel far better in the morning when you\u2019ve stuck to a tech curfew.\nTake it from someone who knows. The biggest improvement in my health in the past four years is that I get a solid eight hours most nights. I feel great for it. I\u2018ve done a lot of self-experimentation and I\u2019ve found going on to night-time mode at 8.30pm is the key. I switch off my laptop, leave my phone on charge downstairs and open a book instead. I\u2019m almost always asleep by 10pm.\nBut I\u2019m not perfect \u2013 I was on my phone last night before bed, and guess what? I didn\u2019t sleep so well. Counterintuitively, the best way to reset your sleep rhythm is to still get up at the same time. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done today, and I\u2019m already looking forward to going to bed tonight.\nThe M&S Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night\u2019s sleep.

Nestled between two gorgeous parks and with what a realtor might describe as commanding views of the Golden Gate, it could hardly be different. Homes in the area routinely go for more than $10m. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and the payment service Square, recently bought a place here for $21.5m \u2013 next door to his $18m present home. The 0.62-acre compound is recessed from the street and perched on a cliff overlooking the beach.\nAnd that\u2019s where things get interesting, because cliffside living has become an increasingly risky proposition in California. Warming ocean temperatures are whipping up stronger surfs and more brutal winter storms, causing cliffs to crumble ever faster into the sea. The consequences for thousands of cliff-top houses such as Dorsey\u2019s could be catastrophic. Still, @Jack\u2019s bet isn\u2019t a bad one: depending on when the house goes over the edge, it might well be the rest of us that gets stuck with the bill.\nThat\u2019s because most of the cost of protecting California properties from coastal erosion, wildfires and other effects of the climate crisis will eventually have to be met by the state, with public money. This means those costs won\u2019t fall on the disproportionately white and wealthy people who own property. Rather, they\u2019ll be increasingly borne by the working- and middle-class Hispanic, black and brown Californians that make up the majority of the state, many of whom don\u2019t own real estate. Without really grappling with this reality, the state is slipping step by step towards a massive wealth transfer from the general public to the owners of private property. It\u2019s one more way in which the climate crisis is also a crisis of racism and inequality.\nWhat Sea Cliff could look like in a few years\u2019 time can be glimpsed in the town of Pacifica, 14 miles to the south. Parts of the town, which is much more middle-class than Sea Cliff, sit directly on beautiful bluffs that overlook \u2013 and are tumbling into \u2013 the Pacific Ocean. When the town\u2019s mayor proposed a \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d from the coast, home owners and local realtors revolted: the proposal would have effectively taken their homes off the market, cutting them off from potential profits. (Owners does not mean residents: about a third of Pacifica\u2019s housing stock, including many of the most threatened buildings, consists of rental units.) So instead of a managed retreat, the city is taking money from the public coffers and using it to protect property investments by building sea walls and replenishing eroding beaches with trucked-in sand, among other measures.\nThis is a dynamic we have seen throughout the late capitalist economy. The sociologist Ulrich Beck described it as a change from \u201ca logic of wealth distribution\u201d to one of \u201crisk distribution\u201d. Profits are privatized, but risk is made public. The banks made a bunch of bad bets on crappy mortgage debts? Bail them out with public money and give the executives multimillion-dollar bonuses. Someone half bakes a fundamentally unprofitable tech business? Let them IPO it so they can liquidate hundreds of millions of dollars of stock options while transferring the ultimately worthless company into the hands of public pension funds and workers\u2019 401ks.\nThat\u2019s the same thing that is now happening in California, where the land is uniquely threatened and at the same time uniquely valuable. There is a concerted political effort not to manage the risk, but rather to keep it from impacting value by making the public bear the costs of the climate crisis through things such as the sorts of publicly funded disaster relief programs and state-subsidized insurance payouts that Jack Dorsey could theoretically benefit from. This is, in fact, what many of the owners of capital and real estate think the government is for: protecting the value of private property at all costs. It\u2019s one of the reasons we have a climate crisis \u2013 instead of a robust, rapid transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 in the first place.\nThe sheer immensity of the climate crisis, and of California, ensures that more and more of the costs will be borne by the public. The Los Angeles Times estimates that $150bn in California property might be impacted by coastal flooding and erosion by 2100. That\u2019s $150bn in private wealth which the government has made it a public priority to preserve.\nThose costs are dwarfed by the risks created by the region\u2019s intensifying wildfires, which threaten millions of properties around the state. Individuals and insurance companies currently bear financial responsibility for property damaged by wildfires, but there is already pressure to collectivize these risks.\nIt will go something like this: as houses become astronomically expensive, insurance payouts become astronomically large. In response, in threatened areas, private insurers will cancel coverage, or multiply rates to the point of unaffordability. The state will be forced to step in to stabilize the rates, and keep the land valuable, which will likely involve something like the National Flood Insurance Program, which subsidizes flood insurance provided by private insurers and underwrites the full extent of their losses.\nCurrently, the state is forcing insurance companies not to cancel coverage, but reinsurers are getting worried, meaning the pressure is on to decline coverage \u2013 something that is already happening in various parts of the state. This is exactly the point where historically the government has stepped in \u2014 and there are already calls for it to do so now.\nThe racist dimension to this wealth transfer must not be overlooked. Fewer than 55% of California households own their dwelling and only 42% of Latino households and 33% of black ones do. Non-urban space, open space, and at-risk space in California is today particularly white, or at least white-owned.\nEspecially in the sorts of rural areas threatened by wildfire, that disparity is highly dependent on California\u2019s history of racial violence and exclusion. The genocide of California\u2019s first peoples; restrictions on the citizenship status of Asian immigrants; the seizure of Japanese American land during the second world war; the arrogation of land for infrastructure projects in the postwar period; discriminatory lending practices, racial covenants and other racist real estate policies, perpetuated by de facto segregation \u2013 all worked to ensure that non-white property ownership in rural California has remained low and concentrated in dense cities.\nAll of this creates an unjust mismatch: the collective that is underwriting the risk of climate catastrophe will not be the same as the group that is incurring it. As a result, the siphoning off of public wealth to protect private property will increasingly favor white Californians.\nOf course, that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s likely to be politically acceptable. It would be difficult to imagine the government sanctioning a massive wealth transfer in the other direction, for example by relieving the mortgage debts of the black and brown Americans who were the primary victims of the subprime crisis. But when fire and other types of home insurance markets fail, as they are already beginning to do and inevitably will, the state will have to step in to shore up the largely white property market with black, brown, working and middle-class public money.\nAs the incalculably large price tag of climate change comes due, those excluded from the property market will increasingly foot the bill for California\u2019s cult of the homeowner. It remains to be seen whether that cult will endure, or whether the state can rethink its relationship to real estate.\n\u2022 This article was updated on 9 March 2020 to emphasize that individuals and insurance companies currently bear the risk for wildfire damage", "label": 0}, "text-383": {"text": "The French are finally observing lockdown advice \u2013 but is it too late?\nIf a week is a long time in politics, it\u2019s an eternity for governments dealing with coronavirus.

Macron and Philippe were reportedly appalled by the population\u2019s lack of collective discipline. The French media reported that one of Macron\u2019s political advisers quoted Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s infamous 1940 speech: \u201cThe spirit of enjoyment has overpowered the spirit of sacrifice.\u201d P\u00e9tain, who served as the chief of state of Vichy France in collaboration with Nazi Germany, believed that France\u2019s abject military defeat in the summer of 1940 could only be explained by the population\u2019s lack of seriousness, poor work ethic and innate penchant for entertainment. P\u00e9tain singled out the leftwing Popular Front alliance, which granted workers their first ever paid holiday, as responsible for the country\u2019s military and moral collapse.\nAfter people showed little sign of heeding Macron\u2019s guidance, the president implemented further restrictive measures. During a speech on Monday, which invoked a mixture of Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, Macron insisted several times that the country was \u201cat war\u201d, and asked the French to stay at home and self-isolate for two weeks.\nMacron has become known for cutting public spending, so his pledges to fully fund the French national health service, \u201cwhatever the costs\u201d, came as a surprise. Most surprising of all, however, was his announcement to freeze controversial pension reforms that ignited a months-long nationwide strike earlier this year. What the political left, the French unions and the gilets jaunes could not achieve after a year of intense political backlash, coronavirus has done in just a few days.\nThis is the closest France has come so far to an Italian-style lockdown. In theory, all French citizens are confined at home and should work from there. Everyone has to download an attestation de d\u00e9placement d\u00e9rogatoire (an exceptional travel certificate). You are not required to show proof that you have a right to be out on the street; people self-certify and sign the \u201cdeclaration of honour\u201d. The government is hoping that people will follow the rules.\nBut the first day of the national lockdown did not go according to plan. In some big cities (notably Paris), large crowds could be seen wandering in the streets. Shoppers bustled through the streets; few wore masks or kept the one-metre distance. The police began issuing on-the-spot fines to citizens who weren\u2019t carrying travel certificates. Didier Lallement, the police chief of Paris who has presided over a dramatic increase in alleged cases of police brutality, threatened to use more \u201cexpedient\u201d measures to force people to obey orders.\nThe situation has dramatically worsened this week. On Monday, 1,200 new cases were detected in one day, bringing the total number of reported cases to 6,633. At the time of writing, there are now 7,730 diagnosed cases and 175 have died after having contracted the virus. Stronger measures should probably have been taken earlier. Macron has acted decisively \u2013 but not consistently. Just a week ago, he invited the French to carry on life as usual, while on the same weekend that Macron closed bars and cinemas, the French executive flip-flopped on whether to hold local elections (they have since been postponed). Instead of giving orders once the virus had already begun to spread, Macron would perhaps have been well advised to sketch out how, in a time of coronavirus, a new French resistance could help contain the outbreak.\n\u2022 Philippe Marli\u00e8re is professor of French and European politics at University College, London\n\u2022 This article was amended on 19 March 2020 to correct Emmanuel Macron\u2019s announcement on pension reforms: they will be frozen, not reversed.", "label": 0}, "text-384": {"text": "Work conducted by highly respected NASA scientist Roy Spencer estimates a maximum increase of 1.54\u00b0C in global temperatures from greenhouse gases, less than half that estimated by the IPCC modellers.\nCompounding this, a peer reviewed piece on climate change finds the datasets used to develop climate models are not a valid representation of reality and, due to data adjustments that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature records.\nVery detailed examinations of over 20 areas across the world has shown no increase in temperatures over the past 70 years and more.

The syndrome is reinforced by self interest in getting funding and promotion. The undermining of academia's scientific integrity is illustrated by James Cook University's attack on Peter Ridd over the Great Barrier Reef, hyped up concerns about which may amount to scientific fraud. The University is motivated by its vested interest in receiving grants based on human induced climate change being both real and a cause of the reef\u2019s impairment.\nThis academic malady could be intensifying - as the Heartland Institute points out, alarmist scientists no longer debate the issues and instead prefer to scream \u201cdenier\u201d at their protagonists. Meanwhile, activist lawyers are tooling up for an intensified attack on mining, agriculture and industry with new university teaching syllabuses being offered to hogtie these productive activities.\nEnergy production: fracking and renewables\nAEI\u2019s Mark Perry shows how the US is now producing more oil than ever before.

And even the Guardian managed to publish a relatively balanced piece on fracking technology and its promise.\nExxon, having been targeted by political attorneys for its alleged activities in producing oil and thereby destroying the atmosphere, is fighting back with counter lawsuits.\nIn South Australia\u2019s state election, the ruling Labor Party is planning to double down on the renewable subsidy-led disaster that is their electricity supply industry by shifting to 75 per cent renewables ($). Sadly important minor parties, BEST and The Greens, are even more extreme.\nThis support for renewables is notwithstanding the unreliability and high costs it has caused. This chart from Peter Rees illustrates generator build costs of gas $1404/kWh, combined wind and solar $5263/kWh, thermal solar $11,504 with rooftop solar a staggering $21,333/kWh. Subsidies add to this.\nMeasuring Australian energy prices over the past sixty years, including the 20 years of the National Electricity Market (NEM), finds prices rise alongside the increased share of wind and solar.\nCould this really be coincidental? To the dismay of the wind lobby, the new Australian National Party leader, Michael McCormack thinks not.  He has read such trends and pointed to the costs of wind, while declaring alarmist climate change science nonsense .\nBlind to such evidence, reports of savings through forced installations of renewables continue to proliferate. A new International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) report claims the growth of renewables looks set to generate cost savings of \u00a317.8bn annually by 2030 for the EU. But they would say that wouldn\u2019t they? Billionaire climate alarmist, George Soros is not so sure: James Delingpole reported that Soros invested $160 million in fossil fuel resources in the last quarter of 2017. One man with his money closely aligned to his mouth is Leonardo DiCaprio who has donated $1 million to a oceanic conservancy off the Seychelles and plans to hand out another $20 million to forestalling adverse impacts of climate change. Similarly, Italy\u2019s leading insurer, Generali, on behalf of its shareholders is planning to invest \u20ac3.5 billion by 2020, in green bonds and green infrastructures and divest almost entirely from its \u20ac2 billion worth of coal-related investments.\nPolitics and diplomacy\nIn this era of Russians tampering with the US elections, Matt Ridley shows how an earlier generation of Russians conjured up the notion of a nuclear winter that would threaten the existence of mankind. Ranged against the usual alarmist suspects were the same serious scientists who soberly dismiss shrill scares of climate change disaster, including physicists Freeman Dyson and Fred Singer.\nJeremy Corbin wants to nationalise the UK energy industry to enable climate change to be tackled. Though this harks back to a socialist past, the goals of state ownership in those post-1946 years were focussed upon (but failed to achieve) greater productivity and higher living standards, not some environmental mirage.\nTo the dismay of the \u201cprogressives\u201d EPA Director Pruitt names the Trump withdrawal from the Paris agreement as his proudest moment.  Others, with a straight face, reckon that Europe, notwithstanding so many besieged and malfunctioning economies, is now going to make all the diplomatic running on climate change policy.

Typically they find little or no change in long term trends.

Significantly, the Global Warming Policy Foundation sued activist groups to withdraw an ad fronted by Peter Capaldi of \"Dr Who\" and \u201cThe Thick of It\u201d fame, which inaccurately said wind power costs had halved over the past two years. Even the price that was quoted, \u00a357.50 per megawatt hour, was almost 70 per cent above the $A60 per megawatt hour claimed for new wind contracts in Australia.\nThe Global Coal Plant Tracker reports that, while the number of new coal plants in the pre-construction phase around the world almost halved between 2015 and 2016, there are currently over 1,600 new coal plant units still planned, predominantly in developing countries.  Moreover, in spite of Australian banks expressing opposition to loans for new fossil fuel plant, there are many willing lenders. According to Banktrack most of the top 20 banks involved in financing and guaranteeing loans for coal generators in the three years to September 2017 were Chinese but they also included Mizuho and Citi.\nNext year Germany is to open another new coal power station, and two other new power stations are planned. The new power station, Datteln 4, was held up by green litigation for seven years\nAt a climate summit in France, Emmanuel Macron mimics Donald Trump with \u2018Make Our Planet Great Again\u2019 awards to encourage the relocation to France of warmista climate scientists.  Unperturbed,\nPresident Trump placed particular emphasis on removing Obama era restraints on coal mining with claims his deregulation achievements so far have brought savings of $570 million a year.\nResponding to the low tax and deregulatory measures that reject carbon impositions of the Trump Presidency, one of Australia\u2019s richest men, Anthony Pratt ($), has pledged a $2 billion paper mill investment program in the US.  It\u2019s doubtful that such a commitment could be made for Australia with its present investment-unfriendly policies.\nCalifornia is moving contrary to the rest of the union, planning half its electricity will be from renewables in 2030 and that greenhouse gas emissions will be 40 per cent below 1990 levels in 2030.

Meanwhile a true expert on polar bears, Susan Crockford, is vilified for releasing research material demonstrating they are flourishing.\nIn Australia, Professor Peter Ridd co-edited an article in the Marine Pollution Bulletin detailing improved procedures on scientific finding assessments to prevent false conclusions and inefficient procedures being followed. The authors drew from the alarmist findings of grant-seeking scientists who created concerns about climate-induced damage to the Great Barrier Reef.\nAnna Marsden, the head of one government funded body, The Great Barrier Reef Foundation (\u201cWe believe climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. We support the Paris Agreement\u201d) called for more funding and, when questioned why reefs exist in much warmer waters than in North Queensland, argued that it was not the heat but the temperature variability that caused damage. But pressing beyond the limits of practical refutability, David Attenborough declared the reef will be dead by 2100.\nClimate heroes of 2017 include a telegenic Fijian boy who has been told to say that climate change (a hurricane) wiped out his village.

This latest success, though, is being widely heralded as his most remarkable.\nWoods underwent surgery on his back for a fourth time in April 2017, which by his own admission was the last throw of the dice in respect of saving a record-breaking career that had regressed towards deep turmoil. In the lead-up to that operation, a spinal fusion, he told of being unable to sit at a dinner table or play with his children due to the extent of his physical impairment.\nThose children \u2013 daughter Sam, born in 2007, and son Charlie, born in 2009, were on hand as Woods won what is his fifth Masters, as was his mother Kultida. Only one player in history, Jack Nicklaus, has claimed this event more times.\n\u201cI had serious doubts after what transpired a couple years ago,\u201d Woods explained. \u201cI could barely walk. I couldn\u2019t sit, couldn\u2019t lay down. I really couldn\u2019t do much of anything. This is just unreal, to be honest with you. This has meant so much to me and my family, this tournament, and to have everyone here, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never, ever forget.\u201d\nThe player was a childhood prodigy who escalated golf, in terms of commercial appeal and popularity, into fresh territory from the late 1990s. He became one of the world\u2019s most instantly identifiable sports people. His insistence that golf was an athletic pursuit \u2013 Woods\u2019s training has always been famously vigorous \u2013 rather than a casual pastime altered the sport\u2019s dynamic and resonated with younger players. That Woods was black, in a sport of traditional white dominance, was also pertinent. Woods routinely suffered prejudicial treatment at golf clubs in his youth.\nHe became the youngest-ever winner of the Masters in 1997, aged 21, by an astonishing 12-stroke margin and was ranked as the world\u2019s No 1 golfer two months later. Woods subsequently spent a record number of consecutive weeks, 281, and total weeks, 683, in that position.\nWoods\u2019s domination of golf was emphasised in 2000, when he won three majors. By the end of 2008, Woods had won 14 majors but injuries were beginning to cause problems. And other issues were to follow.\nHe crashed his car into a fire hydrant when driving from his home in Florida in the early hours of 27 November 2009, citing a \u201cprivate matter\u201d as responsible for the incident. Within days, speculation relating to a string of extra-marital affairs had developed into widespread revelations from mistresses.\nWoods, who had married Elin Nordegren in 2004, admitted to infidelity. It led to his divorce and a break from professional golf. A string of blue-chip sponsors also dropped Woods from their rosters. In February 2010, in what was as extraordinary a scene then as it looks now, Woods issued a televised apology for his behaviour during which he revealed he had been attending therapy sessions. \u201cI thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to,\u201d said Woods.\nIn a book published in 2017, Woods reflected on the behaviour that cost him his marriage. \u201cElin and I were so much in love when we married in 2004,\u201d said Woods. \u201cBut I betrayed her. My dishonesty and selfishness caused her intense pain. Elin and I tried to repair the damage I had done, but we couldn\u2019t. My regret will last a lifetime.\u201d\nAs back injuries took hold, Woods had fallen out of the world\u2019s top 500 golfers by May 2016. Eighteen months later, he was 1,193rd. In between those junctures, in May 2017, police footage of a wildly disorientated Woods was beamed across the world after he was arrested in Florida and charged with driving under the influence. A toxicology report showed the golfer had five drugs in his system.\n\u201cWhat happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications,\u201d said Woods. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise the mix of medications had affected me so strongly. I would like to apologise with all my heart to my family, friends and the fans. I expect more from myself too. I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\nAfter appearing in a courtroom, Woods was ordered to pay a $250 fine, attend a DUI school and perform 20 hours of community service. The golf community had ostensibly given up hope of Woods featuring prominently ever again.\nFrom the start of 2018 and upon healing from the spinal fusion, Woods started to be competitive \u2013 and confident \u2013 once more. He secured a first tournament victory in more than five years and the 80th as sanctioned by the PGA Tour at East Lake, Atlanta last September amid memorable scenes where he was mobbed by jubilant fans on the closing hole. The next step was major glory; as he returned to where it all began: Augusta National.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk in at all,\u201d Woods addd. \u201cThis is one of those things, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. To have the opportunity to come back like this, it is probably one of the biggest wins I\u2019ve ever had, for sure.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-386": {"text": "Climate change takes centre stage in Australia's election\nAs political leaders travel across Australia to deliver their election talking points in farms, factories and sports fields, they are criss-crossing a country in the grip of a rolling climate emergency.\nIn the year leading up to the election on 18 May, huge swathes of eastern Australia have endured their worst droughts in a century. There have been apocalyptic scenes along the Murray Darling river system in which up to 1 million fish have died. In Queensland, floods have wiped out half a million cattle and bushfires have burned close to pristine rainforests. In the usually cool southern state of Tasmania more bushfires have raged across 190,000 hectares of land and devastated old-growth forests.\nLast year was Australia\u2019s hottest year on record and as winter begins many of the country\u2019s major cities are staring down the barrel of water restrictions with Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin and Brisbane all facing the prospect of dams at just 50% capacity.\nBut on the campaign trail, through warming cities, blackened bush and scorched outback, the two contenders for prime minister are trumpeting starkly different messages about what, if anything, should be done to address the crisis.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, represents the ruling conservative Liberal party. The slogan-loving former head of Tourism Australia came to power after toppling his more moderate predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, in 2018.\nMorrison\u2019s stance on climate change can be summed up by an address to parliament in 2017 while brandishing a lump of coal. In a speech supporting fossil fuels, he goaded the opposition: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Don\u2019t be scared. It won\u2019t hurt you. It\u2019s coal.\u201d\nThe idea that many in Morrison\u2019s party consider climate change and its effects to be something to be laughed at is not hyperbole from the left. In 2015, the former prime minister Tony Abbott \u2013 who once called climate change \u201ccrap\u201d \u2013 was caught on camera laughing at a joke about rising sea levels in the Pacific.\nIn this election, the ruling Liberal and rural National Coalition \u2013 or \u201cCOALition\u201d as they have been dubbed in attack ads \u2013 are pushing for a \u201cclimate solutions\u201d fund that pays polluters to lower their emissions, with the aim of meeting Paris commitments of lowering emissions by 28%.\nThe country\u2019s environment minister, Melissa Price, has been labelled the \u201cinvisible minister\u201d, notable for her absence at the sites of environmental calamities, and her refusal to meet environmental groups. The party is also embroiled in a scandal dubbed \u201cWatergate\u201d involving the $80m purchase of water from a company with links to the Cayman Islands that was co-founded by the energy minister.\nMorrison himself kickstarted a scare campaign based on the opposition\u2019s ambitious electric car policy as a \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d, suggesting that pick-up trucks, which are beloved by Australians, will become unaffordable.\nBut in rural areas a number of high-profile Liberal and National party MPs are facing independent and minor party challenges on the climate, the conflict between farming and mining, and sheer anger at being ignored on water management, as well as integrity issues. Independents are also chipping away at the Liberal vote in cities.\nMeanwhile, the Labor party, which is leading in the polls by 52-48%, has promised significant action on climate change.\nIn his speech launching Labor\u2019s official campaign, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, a former union man who has struggled with the perception that he is uncharismatic, said: \u201cIf we have the privilege to serve as the next government of Australia, I will not bring lumps of coal to parliament for a laugh while temperatures soar and bushfires rage and flood and drought batter our land.\u201d\nLabor has made itself a \u201cbig target\u201d in this election campaign, laying out a suite of policies including controversial tax reforms and the target of reducing emissions by 45% by 2030.\nDespite this, the party can\u2019t bring itself to fully commit on climate change, and is refusing to say whether it would stop a highly controversial proposed coalmine that environmentalists say will threaten the Great Barrier Reef. Labor\u2019s equivocation on the Adani project led the Australian Conservation Foundation to give the party a score of 56% on its environmental policies ahead of the election. The Liberal party scored just 4%.\nMeanwhile, the Greens, the fourth-largest party after the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals, was given a score of 99% by the ACF. The Greens have just one federal MP but are a force in the Australian Senate, with nine out of 76 senators. They are pushing for much more serious action on climate change, but have been accused of strategic blunders after they voted down Labor\u2019s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009 on the grounds it did not go far enough, which helped hamstring Australian climate policy for a decade.\nAustralians are acutely aware of the climate emergency. A poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation of more than 100,000 voters found that the environment was the number one issue for most respondents, with 29% rating it as their biggest concern, up from 9% in the 2016 election.\nAustralian social researcher Rebecca Huntley said voters had started to connect the climate change debate with competent governance, or lack of it.\n\u201cThe focus on climate change comes and goes but there is always a foundational concern around air, water and soil that would unite most Australians no matter where they sit politically,\u201d Huntley said.\n\u201cVoters are searching for the party that can provide a pragmatic and tangible approach and they are asking whether the political system can deliver solutions.\u201d\nThe Wilderness Society\u2019s federal policy director, Tim Beshara, agrees. \u201cThe public want action but the level of trust in government is low,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo if any political insiders still see the environment or climate as some inner-city non-core voter issue, then they are missing the wider view, which is that it\u2019s an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, trustworthiness and competence.\u201d\nLabor wants the election to become a great climate showdown. \u201cOn this issue,\u201d Shorten has said, \u201cperhaps above all others, the contrast and the case for change is night and day, black and white.\u201d\nMorrison\u2019s conservative government, meanwhile, is trying to frame this as an election about economic management, saying that a vote for Labor is \u201can economic leap in the dark\u201d.\n\u201cWhat is the cost to the economy?\u201d Morrison asked Shorten about his party\u2019s climate policy in their leaders\u2019 debate. \u201cI mean, if there is going to be a change \u2026 Australians deserve to know what is the cost of the change.\u201d\nThis is not the first Australian election in which climate change has been a defining issue, but last time did not work out well for those demanding action. Abbott rode to power in 2013 on a campaign of three-word slogans, promising to \u201cStop the boats\u201d (of refugee arrivals) and \u201cScrap the tax\u201d (repealing Australia\u2019s cutting-edge carbon pricing scheme).\nLabor is hoping that Australia \u2013 burned from that experience \u2013 has moved on.

Under this regime, carbon dioxide taxes are applied on oil, natural gas and coal purchases according to their estimated effect on causing carbon dioxide emissions, as measured in tonnes. On January 1, 2020, the rate of the tax increases by a whopping 50 %, from $20 per tonne to $30 per tonne.\nResidents of British Columbia, always eager to be greener than thou, were already paying carbon dioxide taxes of $35 per tonne, the highest in the country, and that tax rate will increase on New Year\u2019s Day to $40 per tonne.\nQuebecers are always treated a bit differently, or manage to negotiate a different deal. In Quebec, energy users are subject not to a carbon dioxide tax but rather the prices that result from an emissions trading system that the province shares with California. Under that system, the companies that consume and/or sell fossil fuels must either reduce their emissions to meet a regulatory limit or buy enough permits under a unified California-Quebec permit auction system. In the last auction, held on November 19, 2019, the reserve price was $20.64 per tonne and the median allowance price actually paid was $22.73 per tonne. So, in November 2019 Quebecers paid more per tonne for their carbon dioxide permits than residents of most other provinces paid in carbon dioxide tax. Surprisingly, for the next auction to be held on February 19, 2020, the reserve price will be only $16.34 per tonne. It remains to be seen what will actually be bid.\nThirty dollars per tonne is equivalent to about seven cents per litre of gasoline.\nNext year, we will all get to celebrate another rise in the cost of our energy.\nI hope the Grinch did not steal your Christmas.

The forecast was completed by researchers at Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\u201cDangerous climate change is here, it\u2019s not a problem for future generations,\u201d said Michael Wehner, staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \u201cThese risks have been permanently increased and we have to accept that fact.\u201d\nPrevious attribution studies have looked at the impact of climate change on hurricanes after the storms occur, such as Hurricane Harvey, which researchers said had three times more rainfall than it would have done without global warming when it crunched into Texas last year.\nBut this is the first such attribution made before a storm actually reaches the shoreline. \u201cWe are now confident enough to make forecasts rather than hindcasts,\u201d said Wehner.\nScientists were previously reluctant to link individual storms, wildfires or heatwaves to the background trend of climate change. However, the field of attribution science has advanced rapidly, to the point where researchers now feel able to ascertain a level of influence before a disaster even unfolds.\n\u201cThe idea we can\u2019t attribute individual events to climate change is out of date, it\u2019s just no longer true,\u201d said Wehner. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where we can say this confidently.\u201d\nClimate change fuels hurricanes by increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and heightening the warmth of the oceans. Several storms that form in the Atlantic have intensified to unusual strength in recent years, as part of a trend that scientists say is consistent with a warming world.\nHurricane Florence peaked as a category four hurricane, threatening winds of 130mph, although it has since weakened slightly. It is still expected to bring a storm surge of up to 13ft (4 metres), plus waves, at the North Carolina coast on Thursday before slowing down and dumping a huge amount of rain, triggering damaging flooding further inland.\nMore than a million people have been told to flee coastal areas, with states of emergency declared in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Maryland and Washington DC. The National Hurricane Center has called Florence a \u201cstorm of a lifetime\u201d.\nThe tempest is expected to have a wide impact, reaching deep into North Carolina.

The people with those questions are often isolated and confused; friends and family are often similarly confused. The voluntary sector is like a resistance movement in an occupied territory.

First, Premier Rachel Notley announced her plan to follow through on a campaign promise to review (that is, raise) Alberta\u2019s royalty regime on oil and gas. More recently, the government announced plans to hike Alberta\u2019s carbon levy, followed by even more greenhouse gas controls to be formulated by a newly created advisory panel.\n\nThere are primarily two arguments made about why Alberta should raise its carbon levy and enact an aggressive greenhouse gas control regime. The first is that we are concerned about climate change, and have to do our part to stop it, regardless of what other emitting countries do. The second is, if we raise our carbon levy and enact a new greenhouse gas control regime, we might buy social licence or market access to operate for Alberta\u2019s oil sand sector.\n\nWill Alberta\u2019s actions slow down or in any way affect projected climate change? In a word, no. The same models that project climate change also show that this policy will do nothing to stop it or slow it down. It will, however, make Alberta poorer and therefore less able to adapt to any future climate changes that may come.\n\nIt is true that Alberta generates greenhouse gas emissions and global greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change. But the key word is global. Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions account for 1.6% of the global total, and the oil sands represent about eight per cent of that, or about one-tenth of one percent of global emissions. As Faith Birol, Chief Economist at the International Energy Agency observes, even if Canada increased production by 150 per cent over the next 25 years, \u201c\u2026the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China \u2014 not even one day.\u201d\n\nBut even if every country took action together, it is not the emissions that matter for climate but the total stock of carbon in the atmosphere. Had every signatory to the Kyoto Protocol followed through on their commitments back in 2008, climate model simulations showed that the level of carbon in the atmosphere that we would have had in 2100 without Kyoto would have been reached in 2105 with Kyoto (PDF). In other words, we\u2019d have experienced the same climate change as if the agreement were never signed.\n\nThis is the basic problem that stymies every grand scheme to \u201ctackle\u201d climate change: affordable policies have no global effect while policies that might eventually have an effect are globally unaffordable. Nothing in Alberta\u2019s plan will solve this, no matter how much we spend trying. Still, if Alberta really wants people to think it is acting for the environment rather than just implementing a tax grab and pandering to anti-industry activists, there is a simple alternative to doubling the carbon levy. Emission permits currently trade in Europe for under eight euros per tonne. Let Alberta firms buy these in lieu of paying the existing or proposed new levy, and in lieu of complying with any new homegrown regulations. Global emissions will come down just as much, but at a fraction of the cost. Taking Alberta at its word, this ought to be an ideal outcome. Assuming, that is, that reducing emissions in a cost-effective way is actually the goal.\n\nWill imposing a greenhouse gas straitjacket on Alberta\u2019s economy buy social licence to operate for the oil and gas sector? It is dangerously na\u00efve to think so. The current position of those concerned about catastrophic climate change is that the vast majority \u2013 85 per cent \u2013 of Alberta\u2019s oil sands must remain in the ground. No economically tolerable amount of carbon taxation or regulation is going to satisfy that demand. As Bill McKibben of 350.org put it, \u201cThere's nothing useful Canada can offer if it\u2019s going to develop the tar sands.\u201d\n\nGiving in to their demands will not turn the anti-oil sands crowd into our friends. The ink will not be dry on such a policy before they are back with new and even harsher demands. And they will gleefully quote the Notley government\u2019s own climate alarmist rhetoric to back Alberta into an impossible political corner.\n\nCarbon pricing is politically the rage these days and is seen both in Canada and the United States as a shiny new source of revenue for big-spending governments. But the arguments for carbon taxes in Canada don\u2019t hold water: there are virtually no environmental benefits and no reputational benefits to be had, even at high economic costs.

And the example set by Singapore appears increasingly questionable: the country is to close most workplaces and all schools this week following the prime minister\u2019s admission that \u201cdespite our good contact tracing\u201d the authorities have been unable to ascertain the origin of nearly half its new cases.\nOne senior director of public health, responsible for local health teams including contact tracing, dismissed the experts group as \u201carmchair commentators\u201d. \u201cContact tracing would be a waste of time right now,\u201d said the director, who asked not to be named. \u201cWe should have done better on testing, but that\u2019s being resolved. Contact tracing would tell you nothing because it\u2019s so widespread. We have to focus on increasing testing, and most virologists I\u2019ve spoken to would agree.\n\u201cI suspect there will come a time for contract tracing again, but not now. It\u2019s when you start getting outbreaks in care homes and prisons and hospitals, or possibly when we\u2019re through the first or second peak and the numbers are bumping along the bottom.\u201d\nYet the calls for contact tracing to resume appear to be gathering steam. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has repeatedly called for testing and contact tracing.At the beginnng of last week, Pollock and three others published a paper in the British Medical Journal questioning why the government was not following WHO advice. Then last Wednesday, 24 public health experts, led by David McCoy, professor of global public health at Barts Medical School, signed an open letter urging the government \u201cto expand community testing and individual case detection, contact tracing and appropriate isolation as a core disease control measure\u201d.\n\u201cTesting and quarantine are not enough on their own,\u201d McCoy said, \u201cespecially if we want to avoid some of the serious harms that would be caused by prolonged lockdown. It is not clear why the government is resisting the evidence from elsewhere, as well as the views of the majority of public health opinion.\u201d\nThe group has since expanded to include more than 50 public health experts, Pollock said.\nAnneliesWilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cTo anyone who tells me that contact tracing is too expensive or not do-able, I just say, rubbish. We are now basically quarantining 68 million people. That is so much more expensive. But at the moment, we cannot do contract tracing.\u201d\nShe said with the epidemic \u201cout of hand\u201d, the lockdown needs time to interrupt the virus\u2019s transmission.\n\u201cThen we can go back to the basics of dealing with this outbreak. You test, test, test, test. You find a case, you isolate the case; you find their contacts and you isolate their contacts.\u201d\nThe Department for Health and Social Care did not respond to requests for comment, but some academics believe smartphone apps might provide automatic contact tracing.\nNHSX, a division of the NHS responsible for digital innovation, is working on an app that would monitor other phones\u2019 Bluetooth signals, keeping a record of those most at risk \u2013 possibly anyone who stayed within two metres for 15 minutes, the FT reported. If a user tested positive, they could upload a notification, which would warn people they needed to self-isolate.\nYet the tracking technology would raise privacy concerns, and the system would not work efficiently unless tens of millions of people downloaded the app.\n\u201cMobile technology may be a useful adjunct, but contact tracing and the behaviour change we subsequently want to engender needs an active human element,\u201d McCoy said.", "label": 0}, "text-397": {"text": "England must sort off-field politics to fulfil potential, says Eddie Jones\nEddie Jones has claimed England will struggle to enjoy consistent success on the world stage unless the \u201cbattleground\u201d of off-field politics is properly addressed. The head coach also believes the English game is being \u201cheld back\u201d by tradition and is still not fulfilling its potential.\nWith less than three months to go until the Rugby World Cup kicks off, Jones remains focused on guiding his adopted country to success in Japan but his exasperation with the club-v-country tensions within the English game is increasingly apparent. \u201cI have always thought England have been underperforming,\u201d Jones told the LifeTimes podcast. \u201cIf you have financial security and depth of players, you should be one of the top three countries in the world most of the time, and that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\u201cI thought there was an opportunity to do things better, but then you get into the game here and find out why [England underperform]. It\u2019s a difficult job because the national team is a battleground between the clubs and the RFU. You sit in the middle and are blamed for most things. If the clubs aren\u2019t going well it\u2019s your fault, if the RFU aren\u2019t making money it\u2019s your fault. And that\u2019s been the tricky part of it.\n\u201cThere are wonderful players here and a wonderful opportunity but it\u2019s always being held back by the traditions of the game here. The clubs run themselves basically and the RFU tries to manage it. The RFU has the financial clout but the clubs have the political clout. You need those things to be working together to be sustainably successful. We\u2019ve shown you can have some success here but whether you can be sustainably successful, like New Zealand, in the situation here may be problematic.\u201d\nIn three and a half years since taking the job Jones has worked under four RFU chief executives \u2013 Ian Ritchie, Steve Brown, Nigel Melville and now Bill Sweeney \u2013 and has repeatedly stressed that reforming Twickenham is not part of his role. He has now admitted, however, to some misjudgments as head coach, including employing the wrong assistants and over-training his players during last year\u2019s Six Nations.\n\u201cYou can recruit the wrong people and I\u2019ve certainly done that. The cultural environment we have is not going to suit everyone. It\u2019s a driven environment \u2026 that\u2019s not for everyone and sometimes you lose people along the way. That doesn\u2019t really concern me. We\u2019ve got to the stage now, after four years, where we\u2019ve got the right staff in place.\u201d\nSelecting the optimum 31-man playing squad for Japan will be equally crucial and the latest batch of additional names for the preliminary training camps is due to be confirmed on Friday.

Soup, garlic and cake\nSome people are brilliant when their loved ones are ill, and know instinctively what face to make, when to chat, when to be quiet, when to make tea, when to plump a pillow and so forth. Others are terrible, instinctively avoidant, brusque and awkward. They need to ask themselves what they\u2019re so afraid of. But in the meantime, a great way to show you care while you build your genuinely caring personality is to do convalescent cookery.\nSoup is so famously a restorative that scientists with a bit of downtime often try to show the mechanism. This week, a study found four traditional broths that were protective against malaria, although there was no particular ingredient common to all four. The active property has yet to be identified, which is the fancy way of saying \u201cwe have no idea why\u201d. It is unlikely, however, that you\u2019re tending to someone with malaria. More probably, they have a cold (although my Mr currently has lockjaw, and if you\u2019re wondering what to feed someone who can\u2019t open his mouth, it is of course more soup).\nThe seminal 2000 study on the benefits of chicken soup, published in the medical journal Chest, used the Lithuanian recipe of its author\u2019s grandmother. It found that the soup inhibited the migration of neutrophils, which are the commonest white blood cells fighting infection, and those responsible for all the snot and whatnot. Again, they could not figure out the soup might have this action, nor why it might have a beneficial effect on the functioning of cilia \u2013 the tiny nose hairs that block infective agents. Like so much that emanates from a grandmother, you just have to take this stuff on trust.\nA surprising newcomer to the premier league of curative ingredients is fennel. Again, the scientific case for it has yet to be made, but it\u2019s often found to be soothing for the digestion, good for colic and for period pains \u2013 hypothetically because it mimics the effects of oestrogen. The best fennel soup of all time is from Marimar Torres\u2019s The Catalan Country Kitchen, and involves sweating half a kilo of the vegetable down to complete surrender with some garlic and two onions, adding chicken stock and whizzing it up.\nGarlic, incidentally, cures everything, being an anti-inflammatory, so good for arthritis, depression, gout, the works. My mother once read that you could apply it directly to get rid of a verruca, which she did. But it got into her bloodstream and made her smell so profoundly of garlic that she thought we had a gas leak and actually called British Gas. That is a 100% true story.\n\u201cBone broth\u201d, which is what millennials call stock, is beneficial mainly because it\u2019s high in protein, for which you have a particular need if you have broken a bone.\nThere will come a time when the patient doesn\u2019t want any more soup, but still cannot manage much in the way of chewing. The only thing for it then is porridge, which doesn\u2019t say \u201cI care\u201d so much as: \u201cIf push comes to shove, I would like you to remain alive.\u201d\nOnce recuperation is under way, protein is the main priority: people understand this when they\u2019re doing a lot of sport, but that knowledge somehow vanishes when actual recovery replaces workout recovery. The problem is that a lot of high-protein foods are also quite high effort - you have to chew them, they smell powerfully and they often involve sauce, which is the last thing you want in a sick bed.\nHospitals get a bad rap for the nutritional quality of the food they serve, but the really striking thing if you\u2019re around at mealtimes is how oppressive it is, even when you\u2019re not ill, that sudden gust of cod mornay and spaghetti bolognese and sponge pudding.\nWith apologies in advance, because I\u2019ve often claimed, on environmental grounds, never to eat beef, last night I made crab (omega 3 fatty acids are also good for inflammation, which is a partial source of the low mood that often follows prolonged illness) and then steak tartare, which is a serious hit of protein masquerading as a salad. If someone is suffering a long-term terminal illness, simply having bad days and better days, and their appetite is never very strong, you had just better hope they like cheese.\nA final word for cake: even people with no sweet tooth at all will eat a bit of cake when they\u2019re ill, and people who love cake love it more. Keep it very nursery and simple. Avoid chocolate, because you want it the colour of Victoria sponge. Adding autumn fruits gives it a more wholesome aspect and you will get rid of it even faster. I shifted two entire plum cakes at the weekend, with just the lockjaw and a cold in the house (Diane Henry\u2019s recipe is the best) and have never felt more like a high-functioning Florence Nightingale.", "label": 0}, "text-399": {"text": "Mass Death Dies Hard\nThis essay first appeared as Chapter 22 of the IPA publication, Climate Change: The Facts 2017.\u00a0 You can download a PDF here.\nWhen you tell people once too often that the missing extra heat is hiding in the ocean, they will switch over to watch Game of Thrones, where the dialogue is less ridiculous and all the threats come true. The proponents of man-made climate catastrophe asked us for so many leaps of faith that they were bound to run out of credibility in the end.\nNow that they finally seem to be doing so, it could be a good time for those of us who have never been convinced by all those urgent warnings to start warning each other that we might be making a comparably senseless tactical error if we expect the elastic cause of the catastrophists, and all of its exponents, to go away in a hurry.\nI speak as one who knows nothing about the mathematics involved in modelling non-linear systems. But I do know quite a lot about the mass media, and far too much about the abuse of language. So I feel qualified to advise against any triumphalist urge to compare the apparently imminent disintegration of the alarmist cause to the collapse of a house of cards. Devotees of that fond idea haven\u2019t thought hard enough about their metaphor. A house of cards collapses only with a sigh, and when it has finished collapsing all the cards are still there.\nAlthough the alarmists might finally have to face that they will not get much more of what they want on a policy level, they will surely, on the level of their own employment, go on wanting their salaries and prestige. To take a conspicuous if ludicrous case, the Australian climate star Tim Flannery will probably not, of his own free will, shrink back to the position conferred by his original metier, as an expert on the extinction of the giant wombat. He is far more likely to go on being, and wishing to be, one of the mass media\u2019s mobile oracles about climate. While that possibility continues, it will go on being dangerous to stand between him and a TV camera. If the giant wombat could have moved at that speed, it would still be with us.\nThe mere fact that few of Flannery\u2019s predictions have ever come even remotely true need not be enough to discredit him. The same fact, in the case of America\u2019s Professor Ehrlich, has left him untouched ever since he predicted that the world would soon run out of copper. In those days, when our current phase of the long discussion about man\u2019s attack on nature was just beginning, he predicted mass death by extreme cold. Lately he predicts mass death by extreme heat. But he has always predicted mass death by extreme something, and he is always Professor Ehrlich.\nActually, a more illustrative starting point for the theme of the permanently imminent climatic apocalypse might be taken as 3 August 1971, when the Sydney Morning Herald announced that the Great Barrier Reef would be dead in six months. After six months the reef had not died, but it has been going to die almost as soon as that ever since; making it a strangely durable emblem for all those who have wedded themselves to the notion of climate catastrophe.\nThe most exalted of all the world\u2019s predictors of reef death, President Obama, has still not seen the reef even now but he promises to go there one day when it is well again. Assurances that it has never really been sick won\u2019t be coming from his senior science adviser John Holdren. In the middle of 2016 some of the long-term experts on reef death began admitting that they had all been overdoing the propaganda.\nAfter almost half a century of reef death prediction, this was the first instance of one group of reef death predictors telling another group to dial down the alarmism, or they would queer the pitch for everybody. But an old hand like Holdren knows better than to listen to sudden outbursts of moderation. Back in the day, when extreme cooling was the fashion, he was an extreme coolist. Lately he is an extreme warmist. He will surely continue to be an extremist of some kind, even if he has to be an extreme moderate. And after all, his boss was right about the ocean. In his acceptance speech at the 2008 Democratic convention, Obama said \u2013 and I truly wish that this were an inaccurate paraphrase \u2013 that people should vote for him if they wanted to stop the ocean rising. He got elected, and it didn\u2019t rise.\nThe notion of a count-down or a tipping point is very dear to both wings of this deaf shouting match, and really is of small use to either. On the catastrophist wing, whose \u2018narrative\u2019, as they might put it, would so often seem to be a synthesised film script left over from the era of surround-sound disaster movies, there is always a count-down to the tipping point. When the scientists are the main contributors to the script, the tipping point will be something like the forever forthcoming moment when the Gulf Stream turns upside down or the Antarctic ice sheet comes off its hinges, or any other extreme event which, although it persists in not happening, could happen sooner than we think (science correspondents who can write a phrase like \u2018sooner than we think\u2019 seldom realise that they might have already lost you with the word \u2018could\u2019).\nWhen the politicians join in the writing, the dramatic language declines to the infantile. There are only 50 days (Gordon Brown) or 100 months (Prince Charles wearing his political hat) left for mankind to \u2018do something\u2019 about \u2018the greatest moral challenge \u2026 of our generation\u2019. (Kevin Rudd, before he arrived at the Copenhagen climate shindig in 2009.)\nWhen he left Copenhagen, Rudd scarcely mentioned the greatest moral challenge again. Perhaps he had deduced, from the confusion prevailing throughout the conference, that the chances of the world ever uniting its efforts to \u2018do something\u2019 were very small. Whatever his motives for backing out of the climate chorus, his subsequent career was an early demonstration that to cease being a chorister would be no easy retreat, because it would be a clear indication that everything you had said on the subject up to then had been said in either bad faith or ignorance. It would not be enough merely to fall silent. You would have to travel back in time, run for office in the Czech Republic instead of Australia, and call yourself Vaclav Klaus.\nAustralia, unlike Kevin Rudd, has a globally popular role in the climate movie because it looks the part. Common reason might tell you that a country whose contribution to the world\u2019s emissions is only 1.4% can do very little about the biggest moral challenge even if it manages to reduce that contribution to zero; but your eyes tell you that Australia is burning up. On the classic alarmist principle of \u2018just stick your head out of the window and look around you\u2019, Australia always looks like Overwhelming Evidence that the alarmists must be right. Even now that the global warming scare has completed its transformation into the climate change scare so that any kind of event at either end of the scale of temperature can qualify as a crisis, Australia remains the top area of interest, still up there ahead of even the melting North Pole, despite the Arctic\u2019s miraculous capacity to go on producing ice in defiance of all instructions from Al Gore. A \u2018C\u2019 student to his marrow, and thus never quick to pick up any reading matter at all, Gore has evidently never seen the Life magazine photographs of America\u2019s nuclear submarine Skate surfacing through the North Pole in 1959. The ice up there is often thin, and sometimes vanishes. But it comes back, especially when someone sufficiently illustrious confidently predicts that it will go away for good.\nAfter 4.5 billion years of changing, the climate that made outback Australia ready for Baz Luhrmann\u2019s view-finder looked all set to end the world tomorrow. History has already forgotten that the schedule for one of the big drought sequences in his movie Australia was wrecked by rain, and certainly history will never be reminded by the mass media, which loves a picture that fits the story. In this way, the polar bear balancing on the photo-shopped shrinking ice-floe will always have a future in show business, and the cooling towers spilling steam will always be up there in the background of the TV picture while the panel of experts discuss what Julia Gillard still calls \u2018carbon\u2019, her word for carbon dioxide. Pictures of her house near the beach in Adelaide, on the other hand, will never be used to illustrate satirical articles about a retired prophet of the rising ocean who buys a house near the beach, because there won\u2019t be any such articles. The full 97% of all satirists who dealt themselves out of the climate subject back at the start look like staying out of it until the end, even if they get satirised in their turn. One could blame them for their pusillanimity, but it would be useless, and perhaps unfair. Nobody will be able plausibly to call Emma Thompson dumb for spreading gloom and doom about the climate: she\u2019s too clever and too creative. And anyway, she might be right. Cases like Leonardo di Caprio and Cate Blanchett are rare enough to be called brave. Otherwise, the consensus of silence from the wits and thespians continues to be impressive. If they did wish to speak up for scepticism, however, they wouldn\u2019t find it easy when the people who run the big TV outlets forbid the wrong kind of humour. On Saturday Night Live back there in 2007, Will Ferrell, brilliantly pretending to be George W. Bush, was allowed to get every word of the global warming message wrong, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to disbelieve it.\nJust as all branches of the modern media love a picture of something that might be part of the Overwhelming Evidence for climate change even if it is really a picture of something else, they all love a clock ticking down to zero, and if the clock never quite gets there then the motif can be exploited forever. But the editors and producers must face the drawback of such perpetual excitement: it gets perpetually less exciting. Numbness sets in, and there is time to think after all. Some of the customers might even start asking where this language of rubber numbers has been heard before.\nIt was heard from Swift. In Gulliver\u2019s Travels he populated his flying island of Laputa with scientists busily using rubber numbers to predict dire events. He called these scientists \u2018projectors\u2019. At the basis of all the predictions of the projectors was the prediction that the Earth was in danger from a Great Comet whose tail was \u2018ten hundred thousand and fourteen\u2019 miles long. I should concede at this point that a sardonic parody is not necessarily pertinent just because it is funny; and that although it might be unlikely that the Earth will soon be threatened by man-made climate change, it might be less unlikely that the Earth will be threatened eventually by an asteroid, or let it be a Great Comet; after all, the Earth has been hit before.\nThat being said, however, we can note that Swift has got the language of artificial crisis exactly right, to the point that we might have trouble deciding whether he invented it, or merely copied it from scientific voices surrounding him in his day. James Hansen is a Swiftian figure. Blithely equating trains full of coal to trains full of people on their way to Auschwitz, Hansen is utterly unaware that he has not only turned the stomachs of the informed audience he was out to impress, he has lost their attention. Professor of Earth Sciences Chris Turney, who led a ship full of climate change enthusiasts into the Antarctic ice to see how the ice was doing under the influence of climate change and found it was doing well enough to trap the ship, could have been invented by Swift. (Turney\u2019s subsequent Guardian article, in which he explained how this embarrassment was due only to a quirk of the weather, and had nothing to do with a possible mistake about the climate, was a Swiftian lampoon in all respects.) Compulsorily retired now from the climate scene, Dr Rajendra Pachauri was a zany straight from Swift, by way of a Bollywood remake of The Party starring the local imitator of Peter Sellers; if Dr Johnson could have thought of Pachauri, Rasselas would be much more entertaining than it is. Finally, and supremely, Tim Flannery could have been invented by Swift after ten cups of coffee too many with Stella. He wanted to keep her laughing. Swift projected the projectors who now surround us.\nThey came out of the grant-hungry fringe of semi-science to infect the heart of the mass media, where a whole generation of commentators taught each other to speak and write a hyperbolic doom-language (\u2018unprecedented\u2019, \u2018irreversible\u2019, etcetera), which you might have thought was sure to doom them in their turn. After all, nobody with an intact pair of ears really listens for long to anyone who talks about \u2018the planet\u2019 or \u2018carbon\u2019 or \u2018climate denial\u2019 or \u2018the science\u2019. But for now \u2013 and it could be a long now \u2013 the advocates of drastic action are still armed with a theory that no fact doesn\u2019t fit. The theory has always been manifestly unfalsifiable, but there are few science pundits in the mass media who could tell Karl Popper from Mary Poppins. More startling than their ignorance, however, is their defiance of logic. You can just about see how a bunch of grant-dependent climate scientists might go on saying that there was never a Medieval Warm Period even after it has been pointed out to them that any old corpse dug up from the permafrost could never have been buried in it. But how can a bunch of supposedly enlightened writers go on saying that? Their answer, if pressed, is usually to say that the question is too elementary to be considered.\nAlarmists have always profited from their insistence that climate change is such a complex issue that no \u2018science denier\u2019 can have an opinion about it worth hearing. For most areas of science such an insistence would be true. But this particular area has a knack of raising questions that get more and more complicated in the absence of an answer to the elementary ones. One of those elementary questions is about how man-made carbon dioxide can be a driver of climate change if the global temperature has not gone up by much over the last twenty years but the amount of man-made carbon dioxide has. If we go on to ask a supplementary question \u2013 say, how could carbon dioxide raise temperature when the evidence of the ice cores indicates that temperature has always raised carbon dioxide \u2013 we will be given complicated answers, but we still haven\u2019t had an answer to the first question, except for the suggestion that the temperature, despite the observations, really has gone up, but that the extra heat is hiding in the ocean. It is not necessarily science denial to propose that this long professional habit of postponing an answer to the first and most elementary question is bizarre. Richard Feynman said that if a fact doesn\u2019t fit the theory, the theory has to go. Feynman was a scientist. Einstein realised that the Michelson-Morley experiments hinted at a possible fact that might not fit Newton\u2019s theory of celestial mechanics. Einstein was a scientist too. Those of us who are not scientists, but who are sceptical about the validity of this whole issue \u2013 who suspect that the alleged problem might be less of a problem than is made out \u2013 have plenty of great scientific names to point to for exemplars, and it could even be said that we could point to the whole of science itself. Being resistant to the force of its own inertia is one of the things that science does.\nWhen the climatologists upgraded their frame of certainty from global warming to climate change, the bet-hedging manoeuvre was so blatant that some of the sceptics started predicting in their turn; the alarmist cause must surely now collapse, like a house of cards. A tipping point had been reached. Unfortunately for the cause of rational critical enquiry, the campaign for immediate action against climate doom reaches a tipping point every few minutes, because the observations, if not the calculations, never cease exposing it as a fantasy. I myself, after I observed Andrew Neil on BBC TV wiping the floor with the then Secretary for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey, thought that the British government\u2019s energy policy could not survive, and that the mad work which had begun with Ed Miliband\u2019s Climate Act of 2008 must now surely begin to come undone. Neil\u2019s well-informed list of questions had been a tipping point. But it changed nothing in the short term. It didn\u2019t even change the BBC, which continued uninterrupted with its determination that the alarmist view should not be questioned.\nHow did the upmarket mass media get themselves into such a condition of servility? One is reminded of that fine old historian George Grote, when he said that he had taken his A History of Greece only to the point where the Greeks themselves failed to realise they were slaves. The BBC\u2019s monotonous plugging of the climate theme in its science documentaries is too obvious to need remarking, but it\u2019s what the science programmes never say that really does the damage. Even the news programmes get \u2018smoothed\u2019 to ensure that nothing interferes with the constant business of protecting the climate change theme\u2019s dogmatic status. To take a simple but telling example: when Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s Vice Chancellor and man in charge of the Energiewende, talked rings around Greenpeace hecklers with nothing on their minds but renouncing coal, or told executives of the renewable energy companies that they could no longer take unlimited subsides for granted, these instructive moments could be seen on German television but were not excerpted and subtitled for British television even briefly, despite Gabriel\u2019s accomplishments as a natural TV star, and despite the fact that he himself was no sceptic.\nWrong message: easier to leave him out. And if the climate scientist Judith Curry appears before a US Senate committee and manages to defend her anti-alarmist position against concentrated harassment from a senator whose only qualification for the discussion is that he can impugn her integrity with a rhetorical contempt of which she is too polite to be capable? Leave it to YouTube. In this way, the BBC has spent ten years unplugged from a vital part of the global intellectual discussion, with an increasing air of provincialism as the inevitable result. As the UK now begins the long process of exiting the European Union, we can reflect that the departing nation\u2019s most important broadcasting institution has been behaving, for several years, as if its true aim were to reproduce the thought control that prevailed in the Soviet Union. As for the print media, it\u2019s no mystery why the upmarket newspapers do an even more thorough job than the downmarket newspapers of suppressing any dissenting opinion on the climate. In Britain, the Telegraph sensibly gives a column to the diligently sceptical Christopher Booker, and Matt Ridley has recently been able to get a few rational articles into the Times, but a more usual arrangement is exemplified by my own newspaper, the Guardian, which entrusts all aspects of the subject to George Monbiot, who once informed his green readership that there was only one reason I could presume to disagree with him, and them: I was an old man, soon to be dead, and thus with no concern for the future of \u2018the planet\u2019. I would have damned his impertinence, but it would have been like getting annoyed with a wheelbarrow full of freshly cut grass.\nThese byline names are stars committed to their opinion, but what\u2019s missing from the posh press is the non-star name committed to the job of building a fact-file and extracting a reasoned article from it. Further down the market, when the Daily Mail put its no-frills news-hound David Rose on the case after Climategate, his admirable competence immediately got him labelled as a \u2018climate change denier\u2019: one of the first people to be awarded that badge of honour. The other tactic used to discredit him was the standard one of calling his paper a disreputable publication. It might be \u2013 having been a victim of its prurience myself, I have no inclination to revere it \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t forgotten what objective reporting is supposed to be. Most of the British papers have, and the reason is no mystery.\nThey can\u2019t afford to remember. The print media are on their way down the drain. With almost no personnel left to do the writing, the urge at editorial level is to give all the science stuff to one bloke. The print edition of The Independent bored its way out of business when their resident climate nag was allowed to write half the paper. In its last year, when the doomwatch journalists were threatened by the climate industry with a newly revised consensus opinion that a mere two-degree increase in world temperature might be not only acceptable but likely, the Independent\u2019s chap retaliated by writing stories about how the real likelihood was an increase of five degrees, and in a kind of frenzied crescendo he wrote a whole front page saying that the global temperature was \u2018on track\u2019 for an increase of six degrees. Not long after, the Indy\u2019s print edition closed down.\nAt the New York Times, Andrew Revkin, star colour-piece writer on the climate beat, makes the whole subject no less predictable than his prose style: a cruel restriction. In Australia, the Fairfax papers, which by now have almost as few writers as readers, reprint Revkin\u2019s summaries as if they were the voice of authority, and will probably go on doing so until the waters close overhead. On the ABC, the house science pundit Robyn Williams famously predicted that the rising of the waters \u2018could\u2019 amount to 100 metres in the next century. But not even he predicted that it could happen next week. At the Sydney Morning Herald, it could happen next week. The only remaining journalists could look out of the window, and see fish.\nBending their efforts to sensationalise the news on a scale previously unknown even in their scrappy history, the mass media have helped to consolidate a pernicious myth. But they could not have done this so thoroughly without the accident that they are the main source of information and opinion for people in the academic world and in the scientific institutions. Few of those people have been reading the sceptical blogs: they have no time. If I myself had not been so ill during the relevant time-span, I might not have been reading them either, and might have remained confined within the misinformation system where any assertion of forthcoming disaster counts as evidence. The effect of this mountainous accumulation of sanctified alarmism on the academic world is another subject. Some of the universities deserve to be closed down, but I expect they will muddle through, if only because the liberal spirit, when it regains its strength, is likely to be less vengeful than the dogmatists were when they ruled. Finding that the power of inertia blesses their security as once it blessed their influence, the enthusiasts might have the sense to throttle back on their certitude, huddle under the blanket cover provided by the concept of \u2018post-normal science\u2019, and wait in comfort to be forgotten.\nAs for the learned societies and professional institutions, it was never a puzzle that so many of them became instruments of obfuscation instead of enlightenment. Totalitarianism takes over a state at the moment when the ruling party is taken over by its secretariat; the tipping point is when Stalin, with his lists of names, offers to stay late after the meeting and take care of business. The same vulnerability applies to any learned institution. Rule by bureaucracy favours mediocrity, and in no time at all you are in a world where Julia Slingo is a figure of authority, and Judith Curry is fighting to breathe. Under Stalin, Trofim Lysenko became more indispensable the more he reduced all the other biologists to the same condition as Soviet agriculture, and even after Stalin was dead, it took Andrei Sakharov to persuade Khrushchev not to bring Lysenko back to office. Khrushchev was well aware that Lysenko was a charlatan, but he looked like an historic force; and who argues with one of those?\nOn a smaller scale of influential prestige, Lord Stern lends the Royal Society the honour of his presence. For those of us who regard him as a vocalised stuffed shirt, it is no use saying that his confident pronouncements about the future are only those of an economist. Vaclav Klaus was only an economist when he tried to remind us that Malthusian clairvoyance is invariably a harbinger of totalitarianism. But Klaus was a true figure of authority. Alas, true figures of authority are in short supply, and tend not to have much influence when they get to speak. All too often, this is because they care more about science than about the media. As recently as 2015, after a full ten years of nightly proof that this particular scientific dispute was a media event before it was anything, Freeman Dyson was persuaded to go on television. He was up there just long enough to say that the small proportion of carbon dioxide that was man-made could only add to the world\u2019s supply of plant food. The world\u2019s mass media outlets ignored the footage, mainly because they Didn\u2019t know who he was. I might not have known either if I hadn\u2019t spent, in these last few years, enough time in hospitals to have it proved to me on a personal basis that real science is as indispensable for modern medicine as cheap power. Among his many achievements, to none of which he has ever cared about drawing attention, Dyson designed the TRIGA reactor. The TRIGA ensures that the world\u2019s hospitals get a reliable supply of isotopes.\nDyson served science. Except for the few hold-outs who go on fighting to defend the objective nature of truth, most of the climate scientists who get famous are serving themselves. There was a time when the journalists could have pointed out the difference, but now they have no idea. Instead, they are so celebrity-conscious that they would supply Tim Flannery with a new clown-suit if he wore out the one he is wearing now. In 2016, he dived on the Great Barrier Reef and reported himself overwhelmed by the evidence that it was on the point of death, a symptomatology which, he said, he had recently learned to recognise by watching his father die. Neither he nor any of his admirers at the Sydney Morning Herald cared to note that it has now been almost 50 years that the reef has been going to die soon. But the moment never came, although it will probably go on being about to happen for the next 50 years as well. The reef death disaster is like those millions of climate change refugees who were going to flood into the West by 2010. They never arrived. But when the refugees from the war in Syria started to arrive, there was a ready-made media apparatus waiting to declare that they were the missing climate change refugees really, because what else had caused the war but climate change? They were the missing heat that had been hiding in the ocean.\nA bad era for science has been a worse one for the mass media, the field in which, despite the usual blunders and misjudgements, I was once proud to earn my living. But I have spent too much time, in these last few years, being ashamed of my profession: hence the note of anger which, I can now see, has crept into this essay even though I was determined to keep it out. As my retirement changed to illness and then to dotage, I would have preferred to sit back and write poems than to be known for taking a position in what is, despite the colossal scale of its foolish waste, a very petty quarrel. But when some of the climate priesthood, and even the Attorney General of the United States, started talking about how dissent might be suppressed with the force of law \u2013 well, that was a tipping point. I am a dissenter, and not because I deny science, but because I affirm it. So it was time to stand up and fight, if only because so many of the advocates, though they must know by now that they are professing a belief they no longer hold, will continue to profess it anyway.\nBack in the day, when I was starting off in journalism \u2013 on the Sydney Morning Herald, as it happens \u2013 the one thing we all learned early from our veteran colleagues was never to improve the truth for the sake of the story. If they caught us doing so, it was the end of the world.\nBut here we are, and the world hasn\u2019t ended after all. Though some governments might not yet have fully returned to the principle of evidence-based policy, most of them have learned to be wary of policy-based evidence. They have learned to spot it coming, not because the real virtues of critical enquiry have been well argued by scientists, but because the false claims of abracadabra have been asserted too often by people who, though they might have started out as scientists of a kind, have found their true purpose in life as ideologists. Modern history since World War II has shown us that it is unwise to predict what will happen to ideologists after their citadel of power has been brought low. It was feared that the remaining Nazis would fight on, as Werewolves. Actually, only a few days had to pass before there were no Nazis to be found anywhere except in Argentina, boring one another to death at the world\u2019s worst dinner parties.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, on the other hand, when it was thought that no apologists for Marxist collectivism could possibly keep their credibility in the universities of the West, they not only failed to lose heart, they gained strength. Some critics would say that the climate change fad itself is an offshoot of this lingering revolutionary animus against liberal democracy, and that the true purpose of the climatologists is to bring about a world government that will ensure what no less a philanthropist than Robert Mugabe calls \u2018climate justice\u2019, in which capitalism is replaced by something more altruistic.\nI myself prefer to blame mankind\u2019s inherent capacity for raising opportunism to a principle: the enabling condition for fascism in all its varieties, and often an imperative mind-set among high end frauds. On behalf of the UN, Maurice Strong, the first man to raise big money for climate justice, found slightly under a million dollars of it sticking to his fingers, and hid out in China for the rest of his life \u2013 a clear sign of his guilty knowledge that he had pinched it. Later operators lack even the guilt. They just collect the money, like the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, who has probably guessed by now that the sea isn\u2019t going to rise by so much as an inch; but he still wants, for his supposedly threatened atoll, a share of the free cash, and especially because the question has changed. It used to be: how will we cope when the disaster comes? The question now is: how will we cope if it does not?\nThere is no need to entertain visions of a vast, old-style army of disoccupied experts retreating through the snow, eating first their horses and finally each other. But there could be quite a lot of previously well-subsidised people left standing around while they vaguely wonder why nobody is listening to them anymore. Way back there in 2011, one of the Climategate scientists, Tommy Wils, with an engagingly honest caution rare among prophets, speculated in an email about what people outside their network might do to them if climate change turned out to be a bunch of natural variations: \u2018Kill us, probably.\u2019 But there has been too much talk of mass death already, and anyway most of the alarmists are the kind of people for whom it is a sufficiently fatal punishment simply to be ignored.\nNowadays I write with aching slowness, and by the time I had finished assembling the previous paragraph, the US had changed presidents. What difference this transition will make to the speed with which the climate change meme collapses is yet to be seen, but my own guess is that it was already almost gone anyway: a comforting view to take if you don\u2019t like the idea of a posturing zany like Donald Trump changing the world.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t even like the idea of Trump changing a light bulb, but we ought to remember that this dimwitted period in the history of the West began with exactly that: a change of light bulbs. Suddenly, 100 watts were too much. For as long as the climate change fad lasted, it always depended on poppycock; and it would surely be unwise to believe that mankind\u2019s capacity to believe in fashionable nonsense can be cured by the disproportionately high cost of a temporary embarrassment. I\u2019m almost sorry that I won\u2019t be here for the ceremonial unveiling of the next threat. Almost certainly the opening feast will take place in Paris, with a happy sample of all the world\u2019s young scientists facing the fragrant remains of their first ever plate of foie gras, while vowing that it will not be the last.\nCover image: Classic Comics no. 16: Gulliver\u2019s Travels (December 1943; Lilian Chesney cover and art), Wikimedia Commons", "label": 1}, "text-400": {"text": "BHP will not quit Minerals Council despite differing views on pricing emissions\nBHP has bucked shareholder pressure to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and will remain a member of the lobby group despite disagreeing with it over the importance of putting a price on carbon emissions.\nAfter a review of its membership of industry associations, first revealed by Guardian Australia, BHP has decided not to leave any of them.\nThe move comes despite almost 30% of shareholders last month voting in favour of a resolution that would have forced BHP to quit the Minerals Council and other industry bodies that hold positions on global heating at odds with the company\u2019s.\nAustralia\u2019s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, has also attacked the Minerals Council\u2019s position as \u201cnot strong enough\u201d.\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the MCA to ensure that, where it is undertaking advocacy, this remains consistent with its stated policy,\u201d BHP said in its review of industry organisations, released on Thursday.\nHowever, BHP said it will again review its membership of the NSW Minerals Council before 30 April because of its recent attacks on zero emissions targets.\nIt said the NSW body\u2019s formal position on resolving the \u201cenergy trilemma\u201d of delivering cheap and reliable power while reducing emissions was acceptable.\n\u201cIn recent times, however, the NSWMC has used language and arguments that suggest the association believes emissions reduction should be deprioritised relative to, or is incompatible with, affordability and reliability,\u201d BHP said.\nBHP said it will also remain a member of Coal21 after the group agreed to limit its activities to research into low-emission coal technology.\nIn August, Coal21 planned an $4.5m ad blitz to \u201cinvoke national pride\u201d in coal, but BHP said that the following month it supported a change to the organisation\u2019s constitution curbing such activities.\nIt said it had resolved most of its differences with the US Chamber of Commerce after the body issued a new statement supporting the Paris agreement to keep global heating below 2C.\nHowever, it still had \u201cmaterial differences\u201d on policy with the chamber and three other bodies: the American Petroleum Institute, the Mining Association of Canada, and the NSW Minerals Council.\nAt BHP\u2019s annual general meeting in November, the activist investor group Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) called on BHP to quit industry bodies that have a long-term track record at odds with the company\u2019s support of emissions reduction.\nDan Gocher, the ACCR\u2019s director of climate and environment, said the company\u2019s report was \u201ca vindication of BHP shareholders\u2019 concerns in the worst way possible\u201d.\n\u201cBHP has asked shareholders to hold fire until the end of the year, and then released an impotent review in which the company refuses to bring any of its industry groups to heel,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe investors who backed BHP\u2019s board now look foolish and weak, in the midst of a catastrophic climate-related bushfire crisis in Australia.\n\u201cThis only amplifies our concerns about incoming CEO Mike Henry\u2019s proximity to the worst of the fossil fuels lobby in Australia.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-401": {"text": "Australian rugby heads for world of pain as financial impact of coronavirus is felt\nAustralian rugby was already sickly before the coronavirus swept the world, but after Sanzaar suspended the Super Rugby competition for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d, the game in Australia will be on life support if the pandemic does not end soon.\nAustralian rugby has been placed on the brink of bankruptcy. Unlike its major rivals \u2013 Australian rules and rugby league \u2013 the 15-a-side code does not have a war chest to help it ride out the crisis.\nBut it did not have to be that way if things had been done differently 17 years ago. Rugby Australia received a $44m windfall from hosting the 2003 World Cup. Former RA chief-executive John O\u2019Neill intended to invest the bonanza in a future fund similar to the one the Australian Olympic Committee set up after the Sydney Games.\nBut the game\u2019s stakeholders all wanted their slice of the pie and RA\u2019s reserves have dwindled rather than grown, reportedly down to below $18m. RA\u2019s treasury has been largely drained by bailing out cash-strapped Super Rugby clubs, who no longer have a bank of last resort to rely on.\nIf wisely invested, who knows what that $44m would have been worth now at a time when the economy of the game is about to collapse because of a virus.\nThe suspension of the Super Rugby season is expected to cost Australia\u2019s four teams \u2013 the Brumbies, Melbourne Rebels, NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds \u2013 millions of dollars in lost revenue, money they don\u2019t have in their bank accounts.\nRA and Sanzaar officials have been meeting since Sunday to try to work out how to salvage something from the crisis. Indications are that RA are considering playing local Super Rugby derbies, including matches with the dumped Western Force, to keep players fit and to maintain some cash flow.\nIt would be like a beefed-up version of the second-tier National Rugby Championship with Wallabies and leading Super Rugby players involved, but is unlikely to be the financial saviour of Super Rugby alone.\nWith a federal government ban on crowds of more than 500, any games would be played in empty stadiums, which means no gate-money. And there is also the possibility sponsors will pull out. \nIf Australia were forced into an Italian-style lock-down because of the coronavirus, there could be restrictions on interstate travel, which would prevent teams playing against each other unless they all domiciled in one city.\nThere was talk of Super Rugby players playing in the Sydney and Brisbane premier club competitions, but RA has cancelled all community rugby until 2 May for health reasons, which begs the question: why should professional players be expected to play if it is too risky for amateurs?\nPart of the reason would be to keep players active in the unlikely event Super Rugby resumed before the finals in June, but rugby administrators may also be anxious about providing content for broadcaster Fox Sports.\nWill Fox Sports demand a refund on its $57m payment to broadcast Super Rugby if it can only show local derbies or no games at all? This is a time when there needs to be close cooperation between professional sports and their broadcast partners.\nThe disruption of the competition comes at a delicate time as RA attempts to re-negotiate its broadcast rights. Relations with Fox Sports have already been strained by RA\u2019s decision to take the rights to an open tender. Optus appears to be the front-runner to pick up the rights, but it is yet to be seen how the shutdown will influence the telecommunication company\u2019s thinking about the game and the price it is prepared to pay.\nIf there are no more Super Rugby games this year, or even a few local derbies, questions will be raised about how clubs can survive financially. RA \u2013 and perhaps the individual franchises \u2013 will no doubt seek government handouts, but they will need to get in the queue. Every business in the land, sporting or otherwise, will be putting their hand up, and rugby may not be high on the government\u2019s list of priorities.\nPerhaps RA could appeal to World Rugby, which was expected to rake in $US449m in commercial revenues from the 2019 World Cup in Japan. But once again, every union around the globe would need to get in line.\nAustralian rugby will be in a world of pain over the next few months and that pain will need to be shared if the game is to survive. A huge amount of a Super Rugby club\u2019s budget is absorbed by player payments. If players on million-dollar contracts are not playing, or not playing in front of crowds, it is reasonable they take a pay cut, but chief-executives and coaches should set an example.\nA crisis can be a transformative event. When Australian rugby returns to some kind of normality, assuming it ever does, it will need to think about doing things differently in the future. And if Australian rugby should ever receive another windfall like it did in 2003, it will have to invest it in a wealth fund to protect the game against future shocks.", "label": 0}, "text-402": {"text": "Scott Morrison to focus on 'resilience and adaptation' to address climate change\nThe prime minister says he is focused on \u201cpractical\u201d measures to address the effects of climate change in Australia rather than bolstering emission reduction targets.\nAs the government faces internal pressure to do more on climate change policy, Scott Morrison said Australia was already \u201ccarrying its weight\u201d in terms of its global emission reduction efforts and transition to renewables but more needed to be done on \u201cresilience and adaptation\u201d.\n\u201cI have set out what I think we need to do in terms of the future and that has been very much ensuring that we continue to meet and beat the emission reduction targets that we have set,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think more significantly that resilience and adaptation need an even greater focus.\n\u201cWe must build our resilience for the future and that must be done on the science and the practical realities of the things we can do right here to make a difference.\u201d\nIt was a \u201cfact\u201d that Australia would experience \u201clonger, hotter, drier summers\u201d over the next 10 years which meant it needed to \u201cprepare practically\u201d.\nThis approach was necessary because one of his \u201ccore\u201d responsibilities as prime minister was to \u201ckeep Australians safe\u201d.\n\u201cThe practical things that can actually keep you safe during the next fire or the next flood or the next cyclone are the things that most benefit people here and now,\u201d Morrison said.\n\u201cThe emissions reduction action of any one country anywhere in the world is not going to specifically stop or start one fire event, but what the climate resilience and adaptation work can do within a country can very much directly ensure that Australians are better protected against what this reality is in the future.\n\u201cMy response to these things is always a very practical one.\u201d\nHowever, he rejected the argument that the bushfire crisis should prompt a major rethink on climate change policy in the same way that the Port Arthur massacre prompted gun law reform by the Howard government.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to make comparisons between these sorts of things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they are very different events.\u201d\nMorrison was speaking after announcing a $100m package of financial assistance for farmers affected by the bushfire crisis, who will be able to access up to $75,000 to help rebuild their operations.\nThe money, which comes from the $2bn recovery fund announced earlier this month, would assist an estimated 19,000 primary producers, farmers, fishers and foresters.\nOn Sunday Morrison said the government was prepared to \u201cevolve\u201d its climate change policies while sticking to its commitment under the Paris agreement to cut emissions by 26%-28% of 2005 levels by 2030.\nThe shift in rhetoric was seized upon by some Liberal MPs who are under pressure in inner-city seats over the government\u2019s climate policies.\nAs Morrison attempted to talk up the government\u2019s climate policies, Labor accused him of peddling untrue figures to prop up his claim that Australia\u2019s annual carbon emissions had fallen by 50m tonnes \u201con average\u201d under the Coalition compared with Labor.\nThe opposition\u2019s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said Australia\u2019s annual emissions fell by 87.5m tonnes under the former Labor government compared with just 0.8m tonnes under the Coalition.\nGovernment figures show Australia\u2019s carbon emissions were 533m tonnes in 2014 and were 530m tonnes in 2019.\nAfter Labor introduced a carbon price, emissions fell dramatically from 622m tonnes in 2007 to 538m tonnes in 2013.\nMorrison\u2019s claim is true only when looking at the average figure for annual emissions for the past six years when compared with the preceding six years before the price on carbon was introduced.\n\u201cAt a time of public concern about climate change, Australians deserve better,\u201d Butler said.Voters have also marked down Morrison\u2019s handling of the bushfire crisis, with the Guardian Essential poll finding the number of people who disapprove of his performance has increased from 43% in December to 52%.\nHowever, his approval rating among Coalition supporters remained relatively unchanged, going only from 82% in December to 79%.", "label": 0}, "text-403": {"text": "Attenborough to front climate-change film as BBC moves from teach to preach\nNatural history programming is one of the oldest and most sustainable forms of TV life. It is 50 years since David Attenborough made his first major TV documentary series, The Miracle of Bali, its title capturing the eyes-wide wonder of the genre at the time.\nBut the climate of the BBC Natural History Unit, for which Attenborough has made most of his shows, has changed radically \u2013 because of climate change.\nThe BBC announced late on Friday that Attenborough, 92, will present a 60-minute film, Climate Change \u2013 The Facts, which will be screened this spring on BBC One. The show is a consolation for BBC executives, who had been flustered that the next TV project of the presenter most identified with the corporation will be with the streaming service Netflix: Our Planet, an eight-part documentary series, starts on 5 April.\nClimate Change \u2013 The Facts is part of a rolling season of programmes, under the banner Our Planet Matters, that starts on Sunday night on BBC One. Chris Packham, one of Attenborough\u2019s younger heirs, will introduce Blue Planet Live, billed as a \u201cweek-long examination of the health of our oceans and their wildlife\u201d, focusing first on \u201cthe increasingly fragile Great Barrier Reef.\u201d\nSuch words \u2013 \u201chealth\u201d, \u201cfragile\u201d \u2013 are the new language of natural history television. Whereas earlier work in the genre \u2013 led by Attenborough\u2019s Life on Earth (1979) and Blue Planet (2001) \u2013 looked at the world with wonder, more recent shows seeking to highlight and reverse environmental damage have adopted a graver tone. \n\u201cClimate change is making the natural world \u2013 and everything that embraces \u2013 much more unpredictable,\u201d says Julian Hector, the head of the Natural History Unit. \u201cWe made a big film in Kenya for Dynasties. There was a time when you could go there and pretty much predict what you would find. But there are parts of Kenya that have been in a sustained drought for many years, which means that wildlife is finding it harder to get food, and people to grow it. Climate change is increasingly the backdrop to our films, and so the causes of it are worth exploring.\u201d\nIs it fair to say there has been a shift in tone from celebration of beauty to identification of threat? \u201cI accept that,\u201d says Hector. \u201cIf you go back 40 years, to Life on Earth, that was essentially a series about popularising the subject of evolution, showing the variety of wildlife.\u201d\nHector dates the beginning of the shift to Blue Planet II, two years ago: \u201cNot a single development goes on in the Natural History Unit where we\u2019re not talking about a conservation element or the difficulty of filming because of climate change. This nervousness about the state of the natural world is omnipresent.\u201d\nThe modulation from teaching to preaching has also been driven, the producer thinks, by a change in the form of the genre: \u201cRather than presenters just telling you something, there has been a change in storytelling so the viewer is now much more immersed in the intention and behaviour of individual creatures or species. Which means that part of the story is how the plan of those species is being upset by new natural and manmade manifestations in their lives.\u201d\nIt is wrong, though, to think that the genre has made a simple journey, across the decades, from celebration of nature to concern about it: Life on Earth and other early Attenborough series were alert to the issue of species loss. Those series were controversial among some Americans, too, because of their tacit acceptance of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s relationship with the natural world has always had a tension to it,\u201d says Hector. \u201cThere are many tensions. Wildlife films, for example, tend to celebrate the prowess of predators, as a magnificent natural thing, yet people across the world are completely split about living with predators, who are being hunted out worldwide.\u201d\nAlthough there seems certain to be some social media pushback during the Our Planet Matters season \u2013 especially about calling the Attenborough film \u201cClimate Change \u2013 The Facts\u201d \u2013 the Natural History Unit is helped by having effectively been given, on the question of climate change, a total exception to the obligation of \u201cimpartiality\u201d that applies to news programmes.\nAre NHU shows allowed to treat climate change as settled science? \u201cI think that\u2019s true,\u201d says Hector. \u201cThe overwhelming scientific opinion is that it is a real phenomenon. So we are allowed to present it as an accepted position, rather than every single story having to be countered by a climate-change sceptic.\u201d\nBlue Planet Live begins Sunday, 8pm, BBC One", "label": 0}, "text-404": {"text": "\u2018I know what's at stake\u2019: can Biden win over skeptical Sanders supporters?\nJoe Biden was not their first choice. In some cases, he wasn\u2019t even their second or third. Now, as the all-but-certain nominee, Biden is aggressively courting a critical constituency of younger and leftwing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bid.\nLast month, Biden stitched together a wide range of support from African Americans, suburbanites and working-class white voters to rack up wins across the country and amass an almost indomitable lead over his rival, democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. Yet missing from that coalition is the young and more liberal voters who overwhelmingly prefer Sanders\u2019 call for political revolution to Biden\u2019s promise of a return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d.\nDetermined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify after a divisive primary battle that stretched into the summer convention, Biden is now amplifying his appeals to the party\u2019s left.\nAccording to campaign officials, his team has for weeks quietly engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. The effort, spearheaded by senior Biden advisers, includes outreach to legacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood as well as newer, youth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement.\nBiden has also made overt gestures. He recently adopted a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system and embraced elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal.\n\u201cLet me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator Sanders: I hear you,\u201d Biden said after sweeping three major primary contests last month. \u201cI know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.\u201d\nThere is a delicacy around the engagement, especially with Sanders still claiming his campaign has a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to the nomination despite calls to bow out of the race. The left came tantalizing close to nominating a presidential candidate they hold up as a progressive champion only to watch in dismay as Biden, who is unquestionably more moderate, all-but vanquished those hopes, and with startling speed.\nThere is a mutual understanding that the party must unify to defeat Donald Trump in November. But progressives also believe they have built sufficient leverage to press for sweeping policy concessions from Biden, particularly given the potentially worrisome lack of enthusiasm for his candidacy.\n\u201cJoe Biden, as the moderate frontrunner, has to convince progressives to support him,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, who directs Green New Deal strategy at the progressive think tank Data for Progress. \u201cHe needs more enthusiasm behind his campaign, and it\u2019s been a bruising campaign cycle.\u201d\nIn interviews with progressive organizers, climate change has emerged as a key area where activists believe they can \u201cpush\u201d the former vice-president, in part because combatting global warming draws broad support from every corner of the party. Several polls this cycle have found that Democratic voters rank climate change among their top three issues, often second only to healthcare.\nData for Progress, along with climate staff from Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s former presidential campaign, are among those urging the Biden team to prioritize climate change.\nIn a recent six-page memo, the group laid out five policy areas where he could issue new proposals or emphasize existing ones. They are: stronger clean energy standards with clearer targets, investments in green infrastructure, a dedicated 40% of climate money going to disadvantaged communities, restrictions on Wall Street financing of fossil fuels and a commitment to high-quality union jobs. NoiseCat said the Biden campaign is engaging the authors at a high level.\nSome progressives believe Biden, who spent decades in the Senate before serving as vice president, would have a better shot at moving climate legislation through Congress because of his longstanding relationships and pragmatic approach. Biden also has strong ties to labor unions that are skeptical of ambitious proposals to tackle climate change.\nAlready Biden has suggested Democrats should push for \u201cGreen Deal\u201d spending in the next aid package responding to the economic downturn spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Though he is unlikely to endorse policies to significantly curb drilling for oil and natural gas \u2013 like a fracking ban \u2013 which could alienate supporters in swing states like Pennsylvania.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done to have the full-scale mobilization of the federal government that is needed to defeat climate change,\u201d said Jamal Raad, former aide to Inslee\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the task at hand here for the next president.\u201d\nProgressive activists say their overriding priority in 2020 is to defeat Trump. But they warn that antipathy for the president is not enough to win in November. And how Biden engages the left and what concessions he is willing to make could determine the nature of their electoral efforts on his behalf.\n\u201cWill enough people be willing to volunteer for the nominee? Or send text messages for the nominee? Or overcome the barriers of voter suppression that we know are coming to vote for the nominee,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\nEpps-Addison echoed many Democratic activists in urging Biden to put a progressive standard-bearer on the ticket with him. Biden has said he would choose a woman as his running mate, an overture to Democrats deeply disappointed that two white men in their 70s emerged from a historically diverse and female presidential field.\nBoth Democratic contenders have vowed to actively support whoever becomes the party\u2019s nominee.\nYet Biden, confined to his home in Delaware amid the coronavirus outbreak, has so far struggled to re-create the grassroots excitement that has powered Sanders\u2019 presidential bid, with packed rallies and an endless stream of small-dollar donations. Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to criticize his opponent\u2019s record.\nAsked during the last Democratic debate how he might appeal to Sanders\u2019 supporters if he became the nominee, Biden quipped: \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now.\u201d\nThough Sanders\u2019 chances of clinching the nomination have faded, the progressive proposals he championed on healthcare, climate change and student debt remain widely popular among Democratic voters \u2013 a point the senator has made explicitly as he defends his continued presence in the primary race. His ideas, the senator has asserted, are winning the \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cgenerational\u201d debate\u201d \u2013 even if he is not.\nBiden may be the eventual nominee, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren, but \u201ctens of millions of people who supported Warren and Sanders nonetheless wanted a president who advocated for bold, progressive policy ideas.\u201d\nAlexis Confer, executive director of March For Our Lives, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, said the best way for Biden to reach young voters is to address their priorities with a shared sense of urgency.\n\u201cWe see our daily work as fighting the largest epidemic in our country,\u201d Confer said, referring to the scourge of gun violence that claims more than 36,000 American lives each year. But they also view their activism as part of a wider movement for social, racial and economic justice, she added, emphasizing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t live single-issue lives.\u201d\nIn discussions with Biden\u2019s team, March for Our Lives is advocating for a 10-day waiting period on all firearm purchases, a federal gun licensing program and the creation of an administration role dedicated to combating gun violence.\nPro-choice organizations are also eager to see Biden elevate his support for reproductive rights, especially in light of efforts in conservative states to restrict abortions during the pandemic.Early in the primary season, Biden abandoned his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion with some exceptions. But he has a shifting voting record on the issue and some advocates have called on him to release a standalone plan outlining his commitment to defending reproductive rights.\u201cVoters need to know that addressing this crisis is top of mind for our next president and that our nominee understands that reproductive freedom is fundamental to achieving meaningful equity in society,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.\nImmigration is a particularly thorny issue for Biden. Throughout the primary season, he has faced fierce criticism from immigration activists over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policy, which resulted in the removal of roughly three million people. At campaign events and even during Democratic debates, Biden was met with protests and interruptions from activists shouting: \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d\nCristina Jim\u00e9nez, executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights network, said Biden has work to do to \u201cbridge the trust gap\u201d with Latino voters, a powerful Democratic constituency that tends to be younger. In the primary, many of these voters flocked to Sanders, who proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system.\nHer group, which jointly endorsed Sanders and Warren, expects to meet with Biden\u2019s team in the coming weeks. In those discussions, they intend to press him to commit to using executive authority to expand programs like Daca, which shields certain immigrants from deportation and to repeal a 1996 law that increased penalties for crossing the border illegally.\nBiden has acknowledged the \u201cincredible pain\u201d caused by deportation and recently pledged to halt nearly all removals in the first 100 days of his administration, a move activists believes is a testament to their advocacy.\nStill, many progressives remain skeptical.\n\u201cRight now it still feels like more of the same,\u201d said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at the immigration services organization Raices Action and a former staffer on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to keep pushing him.\u201d\nIn a virtual fundraiser on Friday, Biden was optimistic that he could find common ground with the Democrats most leery of his campaign in time to bring the party together in November.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good ideas they have \u2013 I disagree with many of them,\u201d Biden said. But he continued: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of significant change that can take place \u2013 both structurally and practically \u2013 that can bring everybody along.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-405": {"text": "Pope Francis has decided to make fighting global warming an important papal cause in 2015. At the close of December 2014, the press was abuzz with news the pope plans to issue an encyclical to the world\u2019s Catholic bishops concerning climate change.\nThe pontiff praised the UN\u2019s climate treaty efforts in Lima, Peru and seems intent on encouraging the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics to take up the battle against climate change. The Pope reportedly plans to address the 2015 Paris UN climate conference to pressure world leaders to adopt a strong climate agreement.\nThe Vatican Pontifical Academy of Sciences may be behind the pope\u2019s rising interest in global warming as a moral and political cause. In a December 27 statement, Chancellor Bishop Marcelo Sorondo said, \"Our academics supported the Pope's initiative to influence next year's crucial decisions. The idea is to convene a meeting with leaders of the main religions to make all people aware of the state of our climate and the tragedy of social exclusion.\"\nChurch and Climate\nThe pope\u2019s actions follow recent Church efforts concerning global warming. In 2001 the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a public statement calling for thoughtful dialogue and prudent action on climate change, and in 2011 Pope Benedict XVI supported international climate action taking into account the needs of the world\u2019s poor.\nDepending on the focus of his encyclical, Francis could take Catholic leadership on the issue to a higher level, as encyclicals concern only the most significant issues. They are one of the three most important documents issued by the pope, the others being a Papal Bull and an Apostolic Constitution.\nFather Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, says he doesn\u2019t believe the pope will break bold new ground concerning global warming. Rather, he believes the Pope will focus on the moral teachings of the church regarding the proper role of humans in the environment.\n\u201cI fully expect Francis to focus on the moral and theological questions surrounding humanity's relationship to the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may also be some prudential recommendations which some will no doubt take issue with, and even Catholics are free to do so on such prudential vs. theological matters.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe encyclical's most important role is to offer the theological and moral teaching, not scientific analysis, and that's where I expect there will be continuity with previous papal teaching on this subject.\u201d\nCautionary Words\nE. Calvin Beisner, founder of the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, expressed concern misinformation about climate science is leading the pope to misplace priorities. \"There's no doubt in my mind that Pope Francis means well. Unfortunately, he's badly misinformed on the climate science and energy economics,\u201d Beisner said. \u201cHe and his advisors need to learn the empirical evidence, which falsifies the models behind fears of dangerous warming, and the energy economics, which show 'Green' fuels will be unaffordable for the world's poor for generations to come, leaving them trapped in poverty and the high rates of disease and premature death it brings,\u201d he added.\n\u201cFighting global warming makes little sense for the rich. It's fatal for the poor.\"", "label": 1}, "text-406": {"text": "New signing for Guardian Sport as Jonathan Liew joins team\nThe Guardian today announces that Jonathan Liew will join as a sports writer for the Guardian next month.\nJonathan, who was awarded sports columnist of the year by the Sports Journalists Association in February, will leave his current role as chief sports writer at the Independent and join the Guardian at the end of November.

The protesters, who call themselves the HudsonStand12, were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest by authorities in Cortlandt, New York.\nThose arrests come on the heels of the monthslong protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline project in North Dakota, which, of course, followed the brouhaha over the Keystone XL pipeline.\nClimate activists are now hoping to block oil and gas pipeline projects across the country due to their claim that we must keep all hydrocarbons in the ground to avert catastrophic climate change.

A formal request for the details is being made in a letter by Greg Clark, the former Conservative cabinet minister and chair of the Commons science and technology committee.\nBritain ordered at least 3.5 million of the antibody home-testing kits, which are designed to detect whether someone has had coronavirus. The UK government talked up the potential of the tests last month, with Boris Johnson heralding them as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that could give individuals a \u201cgreen light\u201d to go back to work. Health chiefs said kits could be made available through Amazon and Boots once they had been proved to work. However, all the versions of the tests proved to be too inaccurate to be used.\nScientists have discovered that although the tests can show that a person has been infected with a coronavirus, they cannot adequately differentiate between the virus that is causing the current Covid-19 outbreak and other types of coronavirus \u2013which just cause colds. They found that a range of devices all produced far too many false positives.\n\u201cIt does seem surprising that these tests were bought with a contract that wasn\u2019t contingent on their usability,\u201d Clark told the Observer. \u201cIn learning lessons through this crisis, it\u2019s important for future contracts to recognise this risk.\u201d\nKathy Hall, director of Covid-19 testing strategy at the Department for Health and Social Care, revealed last week that the government was working to recoup money paid for the tests \u201cwhere possible\u201d. Asked whether payment was made on the assumption that the devices worked, she said: \u201cOur overall strategy was to secure tests in order to get them validated. That meant ordering minimum volumes in order to secure them. And we wanted to make sure we had the opportunity to do that, so that was the strategy we took, yes.\u201d\nAntibody tests are considered to be vital to moving out of the lockdown caused by Covid-19. They will show whether people have or have not been infected with the the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Health workers found to have antibodies would no longer have to worryabout being infected or infectious every time they display symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, for example.\nIn addition, antibody tests will give scientists a far clearer picture of how far the Sars-Cov-2 virus has affected the British population, said of Cambridge University\u2019s biostatistics unit. \u201cKnowing how many of us have been exposed to the virus is important for calculating accurately the death rate of this virus among all who were infected. As importantly, the proportion of the population who still have antibodies and \u2013 we hope \u2013 immunity, has implications for what the future of the epidemic might look like.\u201d\nThe importance of this approach was highlighted last week by a study by the University of Bonn. Researchers there tested a randomised sample of 1,000 residents of Gangelt, a town near the Dutch border that had suffered a major outbreak of Covid-19. They found that 2% of the population was currently infected and 14% were carrying antibodies, which suggested that they had already been infected, although many had displayed no symptoms.\nIf correct, these figures suggest that if many more people have been infected than was expected, the overall death rate - at least in Germany - from the Sars-Cov-2 virus could be very low. One estimate suggested it would be as low as 0.2%.\nThese figures have been welcomed, albeit with caution, by scientists in the UK. Professor Keith Neal of Nottingham University, described the study as \u201cgood news\u201d, because it suggested that significant numbers of people had developed antibodies and the overall mortality rate could be lower than current estimates.\n\u201cThe findings are dependent on the quality of the antibody test used, however, and it is important that similar antibody studies are done elsewhere and that results of the antibody tests from Porton Down lab in the UK are reported regularly without delay.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-409": {"text": "This winter in Europe was hottest on record by far, say scientists\nThis winter has been by far the hottest recorded in Europe, scientists have announced, with the climate crisis likely to have supercharged the heat.\nThe EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data dates back to 1855. It said the average temperature for December, January and February was 1.4C above the previous winter record, which was set in 2015-16. New regional climate records are usually passed by only a fraction of a degree. Europe\u2019s winter was 3.4C hotter than the average from 1981-2010.\nThe unseasonal heat has led to the failure of the ice-wine harvest in Germany and snow having to be imported for sporting events in Sweden and Russia. In Helsinki, Finland, the average temperature for January and February was more than 6C higher than the 1981-2010 average. In the UK, serious flooding is likely to have been made worse by higher temperatures, as in 2015.\n\u201cWhilst this winter was a truly extreme event in its own right, it is likely that these sorts of events have been made more extreme by the global warming trend,\u201d said Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S.\nBut he added: \u201cSeeing such a warm winter is disconcerting, but does not represent a climate trend as such. Seasonal temperatures, especially outside the tropics vary significantly from year to year.\u201d\nNonetheless, scientists expect global heating to increase the number of temperature extremes and this is continuing around the world. Australia, which has suffered catastrophic bushfires, has just recorded its second-hottest summer on record, only a little cooler than the record set the year before.\nIn Antarctica, the temperature rose above 20C for the first time on record in February, almost a full degree higher than the previous record set in 1982.\nAcross the globe as a whole, 2019 was the second hottest on record for the planet\u2019s surface and both the past five years and the past decade were the hottest in 150 years. The previous hottest year was in 2016, but temperatures were boosted that year by a natural El Ni\u00f1o event.

Readers on the trees that changed their lives\nAlmost 50 years ago, when Bronwen Griffiths was growing up in the Worcestershire village of Belbroughton, she lost her heart to a tree. \u201cThat oak was part of my childhood,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI kissed my first boyfriend there. We didn\u2019t stay together long, but he still has a photograph of the tree in his office in the US.\u201d\nHer love for the tree outlasted her teenage romance. \u201cWhen my mother was old and could no longer go walking with me,\u201d Bronwen continues, \u201cI used to visit it for solace. It\u2019s hollow inside, and one late afternoon I came eye to eye with an owl.\u201d\nBronwen wrote to us just before Christmas, after we asked readers to tell us about their favourite trees. That first reply was followed by more than 800, from California to Canberra, Kilkenny to Kathmandu. Among many, many oaks \u2013 especially from the UK \u2013 were redwoods, junipers, ashes, gingkos, beeches, mulberries, rowans, chestnuts, hornbeams, poplars, London planes, maples, catalpas, baobabs, aspens, gumbo-limbos \u2026\nThe highlights can be found in our new series Tree of the week, which starts next Monday.\nWhat\u2019s so great about trees? Well, to start with, as the Guardian\u2019s Christmas appeal highlighted, they have huge potential to mitigate the climate crisis: \u201cTrees are vital in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They can prevent flooding and soil erosion. They provide shelter and shade, and reduce air and noise pollution.\u201d\nWe are also inspired by trees\u2019 \u201csense of permanence\u201d, says Christina Harrison, the editor of Kew magazine and co-author of the book Remarkable Trees. \u201cThey live on a different timescale from us, and there is a powerful sense that if you plant or protect a tree today you are truly leaving a positive mark on the planet, which remains long after you\u2019ve gone.\u201d\nYou would, of course, also be giving animals a home and hunting ground. In New Zealand\u2019s Auckland region, Barry Read\u2019s Podocarpus totara teems with birds such as \u201ctui, kerer\u016b, lorikeets, waxeyes and piwakawaka.

In Gers, south-west France, Dick Pyle harvests truffles from his favourite holm oak.\nBut trees nourish our souls as well as our bodies. We are intrigued by their complexity and contradictions; by the way they bridge the earth and the sky, by their inner busyness and outer idleness. They inspire awe and affection, comfort us in times of trouble, are landmarks in our journeys through the landscape and life itself. \u201cHe is my old friend,\u201d Yves Barbeau says of the rain tree he used to pass every day on Holland Road in Singapore.\n\u201cTrees are shaped anthropomorphically,\u201d Max Adams, the author of Trees of Life, says. \u201cThey\u2019re upright, with armlike branches. It\u2019s totally understandable how all cultures around the world, particularly in Europe, have this idea of trees as living, animated souls, such as JRR Tolkien\u2019s Ents.\u201d\nOne reader, Nicola Muir, a yoga teacher from London, recently encountered a sycamore on Hampstead Heath that had a powerful effect on her. \u201cFor some reason, I felt an urge to give it a big hug. Yes, I know that\u2019s a cliche \u2013 for a yoga teacher to hug a tree \u2013 but I don\u2019t usually feel compelled to embrace trees while ambling across the heath.\u201d\nShe has been back to see it every day. \u201cI love the feeling of support it gives me \u2013 thinking of its deep roots beneath me, feeling the steadiness of its trunk behind me, and gazing up at its seemingly endless branches above me.\u201d\nNow in her early 40s, Polly Gutkowski, from Wiltshire, has happy memories of the garden of her childhood home in Gravesend. \u201cIt was my adventure playground, with the weeping willow the central focus. My dad fixed a rope and a swing to it. My two brothers and I climbed it regularly and each had our own particular branch that we sat on. My branch was the highest; I could poke my head out the top of the leaves and see all across the neighbourhood. My dad pruned the tree sometimes and I remember making dens in the piles of the long twigs and branches.\u201d Polly was cast out of Eden at the age of nine, when her dad died and the family home had to be sold.\nIn East Sussex, Louise Munn has been sharing her life with an oak for the last 15 years. \u201cWhen I draw my curtains every day, I have a view of this majestic tree from my bed,\u201d she says. \u201cI have my morning coffee observing it and spend my quiet morning contemplation time with it in my eyeline. When in labour with my youngest child\u201d \u2013 she has three \u2013 \u201cI counted the spaces between the twigs and branches to get through each building contraction throughout the dawn.

Some of my husband\u2019s ashes are buried among the roots, which are now planted with tulips and daffodils.\u201d\nTrees are natural memorials for many others, too. In California, Eric Castleman makes a daily visit to one that reminds him of his late father. \u201cI speak to it as if I am speaking directly to him. Season after season it comes to life and sheds its leaves. I\u2019ve watched it for 14 years and somehow just seeing it makes a bad day seem a little better.\u201d In Staffordshire, there is a beech under which Anthony Cheetham proposed to his now wife, and later scattered the ashes of their first dog. \u201cWe now regularly walk to the tree with our children and new dog, Hector, to say hello and admire the view.\u201d\nIncidentally, if you\u2019re wondering how to tell a beech from a birch, or a hawthorn from a blackthorn, Patrick Harding, who runs tree ID courses for the Woodland Trust, \u201cheartily recommends\u201d The Tree Name Trail, a guide to the UK\u2019s native and common non-native species.

The picture-search option on Google\u2019s smartphone app is also favoured by many.\nPatrick\u2019s own favourite tree is a six-metre-tall strawberry tree, which he planted 20 years ago. \u201cI can see from my study window. It is currently covered with creamy-white, bell-shaped flowers, but for much of the rest of the year, it will be covered with fruits like tiny ripe strawberries. The fruits do not taste nice; can\u2019t have it all.\u201d\nMany readers told us how they feared wildfire, flooding or disease threatening their beloved trees. Drew Whitemore, from Suffolk, noticed that the walnut by his rented cottage was rotting from the inside. \u201cThe landlord thought it would need to be chopped down before it died and possibly fell on the house.\u201d\nInstead, Drew \u201cdecided to try a bit of instinctive surgery and began scooping out the rotting debris from inside the wound by hand. It was a smelly and quite distressing operation; I had my arm completely inside the tree and down below ground level, scooping the rot out as best I could. I then packed the space with soil from around and hoped it might stay alive a bit longer.\u201d\nThat was nearly 20 years ago \u2013 \u201cand the walnut is still with us\u201d.\nBut that is a blink of an eye for some species.

According to data compiled by the New York Times earlier this month, she\u2019s in the top three in donations received in the area \u2013 right up there with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\nWhile her candidacy is unlikely to take her to the White House, some here in Fairfield feel that the message she has brought to the campaign is one worth hearing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about community,\u201d Fairfield resident David Sands said of her platform on a recent afternoon in Revelations Cafe \u2013 a coffee shop and bookstore that sells books by Williamson. \u201cIt\u2019s all about working together.\u201d\n\u201cIn this very contentious time, that\u2019s a really good message,\u201d he added.\nFairfield residents who spoke to the Guardian have no illusions about her chances. They know she probably won\u2019t be the next president, and they don\u2019t even necessarily view her as their preferred candidate; Sands, for instance, is an ardent Sanders supporter. But the community\u2019s fondness for Williamson \u2013 while much of the country has treated her campaign as a political novelty act \u2013 is illustrative of the town\u2019s unique political culture \u2013 particularly in Iowa, where the crowded field of Democratic candidates have spent months barnstorming ahead of next year\u2019s caucus.\nThough the state as a whole went for Donald Trump in 2016, it also has a strong progressive tradition. Barack Obama won its six electoral votes in both 2008 and 2012, and Sanders lost only narrowly to Hillary Clinton at the caucus last cycle. But Fairfield seems uniquely progressive \u2013 an area that served as Sanders\u2019 strongest base of support in the state during the last primary \u2013 and willing to consider nontraditional political candidates who may be disregarded by the national media.\nLocated in south-eastern Iowa, just a little ways up the road from the farmhouse painter Grant Wood immortalized in American Gothic, Fairfield is a small town with a big reputation.\nWith its thriving startup culture, it has been lovingly described by some as \u201cSilicorn Valley\u201d. With its university, founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1973, it has become a hub for mindfulness and transcendental meditation. It\u2019s been profiled by major media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, and was even the focus of an Oprah Winfrey program in 2012. And with the attention has come a wave of presidential candidates, including Williamson, Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Cory Booker and Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 another controversial long shot whose message has resonated with some voters here.\n\u201cShe\u2019s ahead of her time,\u201d Fairfield resident Mary Tarnoff said of the Hawaii representative.\nImplicit in some of the coverage of Fairfield is the notion that transcendental meditation drives the town\u2019s tendency toward progressive politics and respect for less traditional political figures.\n\u201cPeople who meditate naturally find themselves wanting things to move,\u201d Sands said. \u201cThey want their business to grow. They want the environment to improve, their community to be beautiful and fun to be in and safe and all those other things, and so they\u2019re more inclined to be active in that way. Whereas, yeah, some of the other towns in Iowa that are more dominated by tradition \u2013 tradition means pretty much the same. But the world is changing. And that\u2019s where it doesn\u2019t work for them so well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vitality that exists to a considerable degree here because of that,\u201d he said.\nBut Jonas Magram of Climate Action Iowa rejects the notion that transcendental meditation is a driving factor in the town\u2019s progressive disposition. \u201cTM doesn\u2019t turn you into a liberal,\u201d the Fairfield resident said, noting that some practitioners of TM in town are conservative and some of the area\u2019s progressives do not meditate.\nInstead, Magram points to the fact that many residents here are from elsewhere \u2013 including from coastal cities more known for progressive politics than the corn belt.\n\u201cWhen people moved here in the 70s and early 80s, it was like most small towns in Iowa,\u201d Magram said. \u201cWe had to get creative to support ourselves. So a lot of entrepreneurism sprung out of necessity.\u201d\nDavid Goodman, a professor at Maharishi who has lived in Fairfield for more than three decades, is originally from Canada. He was a precinct captain for Sanders last election, and has been impressed with him, Warren and Pete Buttigieg so far this cycle.\nBut he also has affection for Williamson, even as he regards her prospects as unlikely.\n\u201cShe talks about wisdom and bringing love into politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people meditate, there is some idea that they\u2019re increasing in wisdom.

The transactions in question occurred on three separate occasions, and involved selling International Exchange stocks, as well as for retail companies that were likely to be hard hit during the pandemic. The Georgia senator also purchased stock for a company that provides teleworking software. There have been accusations of insider trading in some media reports, although there is no indication Loeffler has been the subject of a criminal investigation over the allegations.\nBut the accusations may have an impact on not just her political career, but on the WNBA. That\u2019s because, since 2011, Loeffler has been one of the owners of the Atlanta Dream. This has the potential to put the WNBA and its players into a terrible position. Her political views \u2013 and the recent allegations \u2013 seem to be in contrast to everything the league itself stands for.\nLoeffler is a businesswomen with no previous political experience. She was not elected to office, but appointed by Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, in what some political insiders have referred to as \u201ca joke,\u201d after her predecessor, Johnny Isakson, resigned due to health problems last year. Loeffler\u2019s background is in finance and she made her money mostly through bitcoin \u2013 the Atlanta Journal Constitution referred to her as \u201ca deep pocketed marketing whiz\u201d \u2013 making her capable of understanding the market well enough that her current actions look even more suspect, though she has maintained that her portfolio is handled by a third party (Loeffler\u2019s office did not return request for comment for this story).\nLoeffler took a page out of the Donald Trump playbook and boasted of her status as a \u201cpolitical outsider.\u201d She was originally thought to be on the more moderate side (probably because she heads up the first women-owned professional sports team in Georgia) and rightwing publications lambasted her as having \u201cties to the abortion industry\u201d (due to the fact that the WNBA has partnered with Planned Parenthood). But she has made it clear that she is \u201cpro-2nd Amendment, pro-military, pro-wall, pro-Trump\u201d and \u201cstrongly pro-life.\u201d\nLoeffler has said she is \u201csaddened\u201d by the \u201cpoliticization\u201d of sports. This puts her at-odds with not only most of the players, but the league itself. It\u2019s not uncommon for professional sports teams to be owned by wealthy white people with views that contrast greatly with those of their players \u2013 just look at the NFL. What makes this feel different is that, in the case of the WNBA, it has rebranded itself in recent years to be more explicitly progressive as a league.\nIt\u2019s more than just individual players speaking out \u2013 though that happens, too. Entire WNBA teams took a knee to protest racial injustice and held media blackouts where they only talked about police violence against black people; last year, superstar players like Breanna Stewart and Elena Delle Donne spoke out publicly against the heartbeat bills that were sweeping the nation. A large number of players are openly gay and support LGBTQ causes.\nBut 2018 saw an intentional pivot on the part of the league to be more reflective of the players on the court and the fans, who tend to skew more progressive. The league announced a \u201cTake A Seat, Take A Stand\u201d initiative that supported six different organizations, which included one that supports LGBTQ youth and Planned Parenthood. The league\u2019s commissioner, Cathy Engelbert was proud to support the players as they announced their new collective bargaining agreement this off-season \u2013 which boasted some of the most progressive family planning benefits in the nation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see her so openly display things that counteract the very core and mission of the WNBA,\u201d a former Dream player told Power Plays. \u201cBut hey, does the person who funds the show\u2019s ideals permeate throughout? Can she believe in both?\u201d\nMost players did not want to comment for this story, which is generally not the case when reporting on political topics and the WNBA. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to talk about something I know nothing about,\u201d one Dream player said via Instagram DM. Angel McCoughtry, who was with the Dream for 10 years before being traded to the Las Vegas Aces this off-season, initially put out a statement to the Guardian and then on social media saying, \u201cI will never judge a person on their political views \u2026 we get so caught up on what\u2019s going wrong. But I remember the million things Kelly has done right.\u201d After pushback, McCoughtry then backtracked, tweeting that she is \u201cobviously not an expert on federal securities laws\u201d and she \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to weigh in on that aspect of Kelly\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201cShe has been a tremendous supporter of the WNBA and the Atlanta Dream,\u201d McCoughtry said of Loeffler, \u201cand helped inspire young women in this city throughout her involvement with the team.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s the sticking point right there. Loeffler may have helped inspire young women, but she is also supporting policies and a government that actively harms those women, particularly young black girls. Girls who look a lot like the majority of the players in the WNBA. Now, though, the WNBA\u2019s Loeffler problem is not just that her views as a politician contrast so greatly with the ones espoused by the league and its players. Now it has to grapple with the reality and optics of the owner of one of its teams potentially using an impending pandemic and the inside information she was granted as a result of her government position to line her pockets.\n\u201cThe Atlanta Dream is not a political entity, and we are in the business of sports and entertainment,\u201d a spokesperson for the Dream said in a statement. \u201cWe are focused on building a successful team on the court and creating a top fan experience.\u201d\nBut that fan experience could be put into jeopardy by Loeffler\u2019s alleged behavior. \u201cI\u2019m a relatively new WNBA fan and was already wary of supporting a team owned by Loeffler,\u201d said Dream fan Janee Ronca, who added that the accusations concerning stock trading against Loeffler made her particularly uncomfortable.\nAnother fan echoed these sentiments, telling Power Plays that \u201cthe Atlanta Dream won\u2019t get a dollar from me moving forward unless Loeffler were to part with her stake in the organization.\u201d For a league that has struggled with ticket sales and fan attendance but is finally on an upswing, a controversy like this is the last thing it needs.\nLoeffler herself may have expressed sadness at the fact that sports are political, but whether she wants to admit it or not, she\u2019s contributed to exactly that. As a politician who owns a sports team, her political views and the actions she takes as a US Senator now reflect on the basketball team she owns. It\u2019s going to be up to the league how they handle it, and they should decide sooner rather than later. Because for as long as Loeffler remains both a politician and the owner of a WNBA team, it will be impossible to separate the two things. And ultimately, the only thing it hurts are the players, who didn\u2019t ask for any of this.\n\u2022 Cathy Engelbert and the WNBA did not return requests for comment for this story.\n", "label": 0}, "text-415": {"text": "Abuse, threats, vile colleagues\u2026 why would you want to be an MP?\nWanted: men \u2013 and women \u2013 who are comfortable around misogyny.

The consequences for faltering female representation in Westminster could be serious, unless there really are unexpected reserves of women who have the ability and courage of a Jess Phillips, Anna Soubry or Margaret Hodge, or fellow targets Rosie Cooper, Luciana Berger, Rosie Duffield.\nAll the more so, since the abuse of female politicians by anonymous online persecutors is supplemented, the better to keep the former in their place, by more crafted insults from media professionals. Last week Theresa May was denounced, by Quentin Letts, one still-resentful fan of her successor, as a \u201cbrine-washed limpet of a prime minister\u201d, weepy yet of \u201cshrivelling dullness\u201d, someone whose failure was on such a scale as to make the fastidious writer \u201cfeel dirty\u201d.

Those emails, concocted from the fevered imaginations of the scientists involved.\nNigh on 10 years have passed since then and we are currently experiencing another peak in the hysteria that seems to be coordinated worldwide. But why? Why now? The global warming scientists have plenty of time on their hands and plenty of money. Idle curiosity would have got some to have a stab at figuring out what is going to happen to climate. Do they see an imminent cooling and they have to get legislation in place before that is apparent?\nWhat the graph shows is the departure from the average for the 30 years from 1981 to 2010. The last data point is February 2019 with a result of -0.03 degrees C. So we have had 40 years of global warming and the temperature has remained flat. In fact it is slightly cooler than the long term average. Is it possible to believe in global warming when the atmosphere has cooled? No, not rationally. Is it possible for global warming to be real if the atmosphere has cooled? Again no.\nNow let\u2019s look at carbon dioxide, which is supposed to be driving the global warming, if it was happening. A lab high up on Mauna Loa in Hawaii has been measuring the atmospheric concentration since 1958.

Records of that have been kept since 1868:\nThe second half of the 20th century had a solar magnetic field strength that was 50% higher than that of the last 60 years of the Little Ice Age. That ended in 2006. We are now back to the solar activity levels of the 19th century and that will bring the sort of climate our forbears had then.\nAnd so it has come to pass. January-February had record cold over North America. Seemingly the polar vortex was everywhere because Japan also had record cold.\nWaiting for global warming to happen is like Waiting for Godot. It is never going to happen and the wait is getting beyond tedious.\nIn the meantime there is no evidence for global warming and the opposite is happening, as shown by the record cold we have just experienced.

During the reportedly hour-long visit, Covington posed alongside Trump, who wore the champion\u2019s belt on his shoulder.\n\u201cTrump was really cool,\u201d Covington said in 2019. \u201cHe kept calling me \u2018Champ\u2019. As soon as I gave him the belt he tried to give it back to me. I told him \u2018No, Mr President this belt is for you. You are the champion of the American people. You are making this country great again.\u2019\u201d\nLike @POTUS @realDonaldTrump always says: Promises made. Promises kept. Pleasure to finally meet you Mr. President. Thank you for always putting America first! #maga #GreatAmericanWinningMachine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/yYZWkdd5wS\nWhile Covington\u2019s partiality to Trump has helped him stand out amongst a roster packed with nearly 600 fighters, the welterweight antics have also lead to accusations of racism and xenophobia. Following his upset victory over former title contender Demian Maia in October 2017, Covington called Brazil a \u201cdump\u201d and told the local crowd that \u201call you filthy animals suck\u201d \u2013 an incident that led to a confrontation with former UFC heavyweight champion Fabricio Werdum. The Brazilian fighter allegedly attacked Covington with a boomerang outside of a hotel in Australia and was charged with assault as a result. The UFC later released a statement revealing that they were investigating the situation. However, neither fighter faced any repercussions and Covington was allowed to continue spewing hate to promote his fights.\nThe UFC welterweight has since denied being a racist, instead claiming, \u201cI\u2019m not a racist, I\u2019m just a realist. Just calling it how I see it.\u201d And yet he continued to use xenophobia to strategically place himself in potential title fights. He set his sights on UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman, a Nigerian-Muslim fighter who resides in the United States. Covington\u2019s comments led to an altercation between the two men at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas. Two days later, Covington told ESPN that he was \u201cnot going to press charges\u201d because he disn\u2019t want Usman\u2019s \u201cass deported back to Nigeria.\u201d\nCovington is not the only fighter who has made racist, sexist, or xenophobic statements during his UFC tenure; former heavyweight champion Fabricio Werdum was forced to apologise for using a homophobic slur in 2017, while superstar Conor McGregor used xenophobia and Islamophobia to provoke lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. However, Covington is the only fighter who has managed to parlay his racism and political leaning into an opportunity to meet the President of the United States. He is also the only fighter using his platform to regurgitate statements made on the President\u2019s Twitter account, emphasizing his role in the dissemination of Trump\u2019s controversial politics.\nCovington\u2019s Twitter timeline gives us better understanding of his political convictions than his athletic ambitions. He has retweeted posts from Donald Trump Jr claiming that the migrant caravans that arrived at the US-Mexico border from Central America were an \u201cobvious political stunt\u201d, and even told actor Chris Evans to \u201cquit the crying and shut your slimy liberal mouth before I shut it for you #MAGA\u201d when Evans spoke out against Kanye West wearing a MAGA hat.\nIn June 2018, just two months shy of his visit to the Oval Office, Covington called the NFL\u2019s Philadelphia Eagles and the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors \u201closers\u201d and criticized the teams for refusing to visit to the White House following their respective national championships. He underlined his distaste for activism in sports by calling Colin Kaepernick a \u201cspineless sack of shit\u201d along with the hashtag #NikeBoycott, then doubled down by tweeting at NFL players, \u201cYou may kneel before me, but be prepared to get slapped if the National Anthem is playing.\u201d\n.@NFL Players: You may kneel before me, but be prepared to get slapped if The National Anthem is playing. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #MAGA #Trump2020 #nfl #GreatAmericanWinningMachine pic.twitter.com/tQykeJX5Y7\nCovington makes his politics clear in his media appearances too. During a recent interview with MMAFighting, Covington hinted that he might speak at the Republican National Convention ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\u201cThat would be a bigger spotlight or any opportunity could ever bring me,\u201d Covington said. \u201cIt would be such an honor to speak on President Trump\u2019s behalf at the [Republican National Convention]. I look forward to it. I think there\u2019s a real possibility.\u201d\nCovington, of course, is perfectly entitled to his views. Athletes at the other end of the political spectrum, such as Megan Rapinoe and LeBron James, make their opinions clear on social media and in interviews. But the significance of Covington\u2019s relationship with Trump isn\u2019t so much about the fighter\u2019s views as what it reveals about the President and his family. Trump has called NFL players who peacefully protest \u201csons of bitches\u201d and warned Rapinoe not to \u201cdisrespect\u201d her country.\nYet when Covington expresses his views he gets a personal visit from the President\u2019s sons and a meeting at the White House. On Saturday night, Trump was at it again. Minutes after tweeting about the mass shooting in El Paso, the President\u2019s mind turned to other matters of national significance: he told Covington to go out and \u201cfight hard\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-419": {"text": "For more than a decade, the Heartland Institute has tried to explain to the public, in courteous terms, that the idea of a human-caused global warming catastrophe is a delusion, and that its proponents should not be allowed to waste the world\u2019s economic resources through arrogant efforts to alter the planet\u2019s climate.\nTim Ball, Ph.D., takes up the issue with strong words in his new book,\u00a0The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science", "label": 1}, "text-420": {"text": "Understanding Brisbane\u2019s Temperature History (Part 1)\nDECONSTRUCTION can be affirmation rather than questioning.  Jaco Vlok and I have been deconstructing various temperature series from the Brisbane region with a view to developing an index that is an accurate, and affirming, representation of Brisbane\u2019s temperature history.\nTo progress this work, we are making the following two recommendations, that concern the Australian National Archive:\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  The Australian National Archive needs to digitise the long temperature series from the mercury thermometer that was recording temperatures at the Brisbane airport (station number 40842) from 9 June 2004 until 3 September 2014, as shown in the Gantt chart.  Only when this data is available will it be possible to begin to know if measurements from electronic probes now recording official temperatures, have any equivalence with temperature measurements from 100 years ago.\n2. The first government weather station at Brisbane (station number 40214) opened in 1840, which is 179 years ago.  The daily recordings from this mercury thermometer should be There may be daily temperature readings and they may be archived in the Australian National Archive.  This needs to be confirmed, and the daily maximum values digitised to enable the current record for Brisbane to be extended back in time.\nFor the period from 1840 to 1896 the mercury thermometer was housed in a Glaisher stand rather than a Stevenson screen.* It is unknown how the thermometers where housed before the installation of the Stevenson screen in 1896.\nThere will potentially need to be an adjustment when joining the series. Adjustments are currently made by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to all the Brisbane series for the period from 1950, through the process of homogenisation.\nBACKGROUND\nThere is intense interest in climate change as a cause, but perhaps not enough interest in the quality of the data underpinning all the rhetoric. If we really care about this issue of global warming then we will want to know exactly how much temperatures have really warmed over recent decades.  So, we will need to know the equivalence of temperatures now measured using electronic probes with temperatures previously measured using mercury thermometers.\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology measures temperatures from electronic probes that have not been calibrated relative to the mercury thermometers that were once used.  Further, the Bureau makes adjustments to temperatures after they have been measured, recorded and archived in the creation of the new official temperature series, known as ACORN-SAT. These homogenised series are then used to calculate national and global averages.\nMark Huxley Akin (Huck) has suggested that we just get on and start constructing regional climate indices based on real and unadjusted/unhomogenised temperature series.\nSpecifically, he has suggested we use \u201ca good sample of well-sited stations with long histories\u201d, using the analogy of the Dow Jones Average. He writes:\nNo one ever tries to establish an impossible-to-define \u2018average stock price\u2019\u2014 including many stocks of doubtful provenance \u2014 and nobody cares. These pre-selected indexes of certain representative stocks, that are then followed over a long time-span, tell investors what they really want to know: how the market moves over time, relative to itself.\nIt is the case that for some Australian locations there are long consistent records through much of the twentieth century.  For example,  temperature data recorded at Brisbane (station number 40214) are currently publicly available from January 1887 to March 1986. This is one of the longest continuous high quality temperature records for anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere with measurements taken using the same mercury thermometer at the same place every day (although the Glaisher stand was replaced with a Stevenson screen in 1896).\nProblems begin, however, around the late 1980s, when there are site moves and equipment changes.  In the case of Brisbane, in order to continue any index beyond 1986, it is going to be necessary to join different temperature series and yet there is no data to quantify the equivalence of the measurements from electronic probes, mercury thermometers and also thermohygrographs \u2014 that were also used at Brisbane.\nThe first ever detailed list of the equipment used to measure temperatures at Brisbane has just been compiled by Jaco Vlok, as shown in master_table4 which is a work-in-progress.\nBRISBANE MAXIMA IN THE RAW\nAccording to the available metadata, maximum temperatures were measured at Brisbane (40214) from January 1840 until July 1994.  There is only data available online, however, to construct an annual mean series from 1887 to 1985, as shown in Figure 1.  For most of this record, from 1896, temperatures were recorded using the same mercury thermometer in a Stevenson screen.  This very long continuous record does NOT show a pattern of warming consistent with human-caused global warming theory, Figure 1.\nConsistent with many other such high-quality and long continuous records from Australia, this maximum temperature series shows cooling to about 1960 and then warming.\nTHE OFFICIAL BRISBANE RECORD\nThe official temperature record for Brisbane is from a combination of two official Bureau series both recorded at the airport (Series 40223 and 40842), and subsequently homogenised.  The homogenisation method is outlined in general terms in a peer-reviewed article by Blair Trewin published in 2013.\nIn the case of Brisbane, Blair Trewin has decided to begin the official record in 1950, which is presented as a bar chart at the Bureau of Meteorology website, as shown in Figure 2.\nThe temperature series used to construct this bar chart are shown in Figure 3, as well as the resulting ACORN-SAT versions 1 and 2.\nACORN-SAT version 2, as shown in Figure 3, represents the official record for Brisbane and data from this series is incorporated into international datasets.\nThe latest official ACORN-SAT maximum temperature series for Brisbane (version 2 in Figure 3) suggests warming of 0.9 degrees Celsius per century.\nTo be clear, this temperature series does not show the early measurements for Brisbane, so it does not show how hot temperatures were in 1902 and then again in 1912 and 1915.  The official record also does not show the period of overall cooling, to about 1960.\nCHANGING SITES AND CHANGING EQUIPMENT\nIt is a fact that understanding the true temperature history of a place can be difficult because of: site moves, changes in equipment, changes in the method of recording for the same equipment, and homogenisation of the raw data.\nA true representation of temperatures over the last 100 years for Brisbane would not ignore the long series beginning in 1840.  Nor would a true representation gloss over the many equipment changes particularly since 1995, as shown in the first Gantt chart, and that Jaco Vlok has began to document in Table 1.\nSince 1996 the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has been transitioning away from the use of traditional mercury thermometers to electronic probes in automatic weather stations for the measurement of maximum temperatures.  This is a major change in equipment \u2014 a major change in how temperatures are measured \u2014 yet when this change occurs the Bureau keeps the same station number and just continues to add to the previous record.\nThis is in contravention of its own policies that clearly state that a new station number should be assigned, and that there should be at least three years (preferably five) of overlapping/parallel temperature recordings at the same location.\nThis parallel data exists for a limited number of stations, but the Bureau has so far not made the data accessible. Much of it is currently held by the Australian National Archive as manual recordings into observation books.  The numbers need to be digitised so that we can see whether or not the measurements from the electronic probes are comparable to the measurements from the mercury thermometers.\nAfter much effort, I obtained parallel data for Mildura \u2013 as thousands of photographed records.  Manual transcribing of some of the data has established that the current electronic probe at Mildura often records 0.4 degrees Celsius hotter \u2014 for the same weather.   The first electronic probe at Mildura actually recorded cooler.  So, the custom-built probes installed sequentially at Mildura have different time constants.  It was only possible to establish this after the parallel data was provided to me, and I began an analysis of some of the manually transcribed data.\nWe know that since 1996 the temperature record for the Brisbane airport (station number 040842) actually represents measurements from an electronic probe, not a mercury thermometer. We don\u2019t know what the time constant is for this probe.  We do know that there is parallel data available from 14 February 2000; that is temperature measurements taken from a mercury thermometer in the same shelter (Stevenson screen).\nWe know that there have been four different probes used at the Brisbane airport site, as shown in Table 1.\nThe Bureau has not published the time constants for these probes.  Depending on the time-constant, a probe may be much more sensitive to temperature change than a mercury thermometer and thus record warmer temperatures for the same weather.\nAPPROPRIATE QUALITY ASSURANCE\nBreaking down the Bureau\u2019s series into their component parts and then plotting the available data on one chart, can give an indication of temperature change since 1897.\nThe extent to which the many different Brisbane series move in synchrony suggests they are an accurate representation of climate variability and change for this region, as shown in Figure 4. Consider, for example, the first three records in the table for the period from 1950 to 1986; including the Brisbane Regional Office (40214), Brisbane airport (40223) and Amberley (40004) series: they generally move in unison but do not show a consistent warming trend.\nAt the moment this is all a work in progress, with the labels for the series charted in Figure 4 not yet corresponding to the new codes/numbers in Table 1.\nMOVING FORWARD\nBrisbane\u2019s temperature record could form the basis of a new index of temperature change.  The construction of such an index would be aided by the provision of parallel data, that is data from both a mercury thermometer and electronic probe recorded at the same time and place.\nSpecifically, the most useful data right now would be the mercury thermometer recordings from the Brisbane airport (station number 40842) from 9 June 2004 until 3 September 2014, as shown in the Gantt chart. This information is held by the Australian National Archive and needs to be made publicly available, and digitised.\n*****\nThe image featured at the top of this blog post is from https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blogs/jol/inclement-wragge-pioneer-weather-forecaster.

The plan, which was vigorously opposed by oil and gas interests including BP, would have placed a $15 fee on each ton of CO2 and potentially acted as a springboard for other states to do likewise.\nWashington state voters have now rejected carbon pricing on three separate occasions, raising doubts as to whether the concept, backed by many economists as the best way to drive down emissions and avoid disastrous climate change, will gain traction in the US.\nElsewhere, a ballot proposal to require that Arizona get half of its electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind was rejected by voters in the state. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent $40m to successfully fend off an attempt to impose a half-mile buffer between drilling operations and people\u2019s homes. In Florida, however, voters backed a measure to ban oil and gas drilling in state waters. Oliver Milman\nDemocrats picked up seven governor\u2019s seats by early Wednesday.\nThe governor races are particularly important because of a once-in-a-decade redistricting process due to begin in 2021. States will be required to redraw congressional districts to make sure each one represents the same number of residents.\nThat\u2019s where gerrymandering \u2013 the process where a party draws often oddly shaped districts to best maximize their voters \u2013 can occur.\nState legislatures do the redrawing, but it is the state\u2019s governor who has the ability to sign or veto the new congressional map in their state. That means a Democrat governor elected on Tuesday to a four-year term would have the power to prevent Republicans \u2013 who have become experts at gerrymandering, most notably in Pennsylvania \u2013 from redrawing districts in a way which would benefit them in upcoming elections to the House of Representatives.\nFlorida was seen as particularly important as the state is expected to gain two congressional seats after the 2020 census. That\u2019s down to a long-term population shift away from the north-east and midwest towards states like Florida and Texas. Unfortunately for Democrats, Andrew Gillum lost on Tuesday.

That improvement was driven largely by more women, adults aged 55 and over, and people with disabilities or long-term health conditions becoming more active \u2013 inspired in part by campaigns such as This Girl Can.\nHowever, the picture was mixed with Sport England, the funding body for grassroots sport, also reporting a \u201cconcerning drop\u201d in the activity levels of young people between 16 and 34 by 265,100 in 2019 compared to the year before. The survey also found that 11.1m adults (24.8%) in England are inactive \u2013 with those in lower socio-economic groups 18% less likely to do any sort of fitness activity compared to those from the most affluent groups.\nSport England now fears the trend for those in lower socio-economic groups to be less active could grow during the pandemic \u2013 with separate research conducted by ComRes for the organisation showing that people on low incomes are finding it harder than normal to be active at the moment.\nWhile welcoming the report, the Sport England chief executive, Tim Hollingsworth, admitted there were areas of concern \u2013 and urged sport to start thinking collectively about how to sustain the nation\u2019s wellbeing after the pandemic.\n\u201cThat overall activity levels were at a record high across England at the end of last year is excellent news, particularly the strong growth among older adults, people with a disability and among those with long-term health conditions,\u201d Hollingsworth said.\n\u201cHowever, behind the overall positive picture there remain areas of real concern. Not least the sobering reality that if you are well-off you are far more likely to be active than if you are not, and the ongoing evidence of a significant ethnicity gap, where we are not seeing growth in activity levels among some ethnic groups.\n\u201cAdded to this now is the unprecedented disruption the pandemic and lockdown is having on people\u2019s sport and activity habits and behaviours. The true nature of this, and its impact on the nation\u2019s future activity and the ability of the sector to support that, is still unknown. But it is what anyone with an interest in sustaining the nation\u2019s wellbeing, and the positive impact that sport can have on society, needs to start thinking about now.\n\u201cHow we shape our collective response to this challenge will not only determine future participation levels, but also give us the opportunity fundamentally to address and reverse those inequalities.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-426": {"text": "Have you been invited to take part in the UK citizens' climate assembly?\nFrom Wednesday, 30,000 people will begin to receive invitations to take part in a citizens\u2019 assembly on the climate emergency convened by MPs.\nA demographically representative sample of the population will then be selected from those who respond, with 110 people taking part in the Climate Assembly UK over four weekends in Birmingham next year.\nParticipants will be asked to discuss how the UK should respond to the climate emergency and what policies they would like to see implemented to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, now enshrined in law.\nWe want to hear from people who have received an invitation to take part about their views on participating.\nWe are interested in hearing from people who have received an invitation to take part in Climate Assembly UK.\nAre you pleased?

The scientist who predicted the bushfire emergency four decades ago\nFrom his lounge in Brunswick, Melbourne, 72-year-old Dr Tom Beer has been watching the fury of an unprecedented Australian bushfire season unfolding on his television screen.\n\u201cI feel really sorry for the firefighters who\u2019ve got extraordinarily tough jobs ahead, and it\u2019s only going to get tougher,\u201d says Beer.\n\u201cBut I feel maybe I was not enough of a prophet crying in the wilderness.\u201d\nBack in 1986, Beer was working as a CSIRO meteorologist looking at bushfires when he was asked by his boss, Dr Graeme Pearman, to go and find out what the greenhouse effect might mean for the future of fires.\nBeer\u2019s findings in 1987, published in 1988 as \u201cAustralian bushfire danger under changing climatic regimes\u201d, became the first study in the world to ask what climate change was going to mean for wildfires.\n\u201cIt seems obvious, but actually we found the correlation was not temperature and fires, but relative humidity and fires. Temperature goes up, it gets drier, and then the fires go up,\u201d says Beer.\nAustralia\u2019s bushfire season has started early this year, with fire chiefs saying the length, extent and intensity of the fires is unprecedented.\nMore than a million hectares has been burned, entire towns and communities have been decimated and lives have been lost. In just one week in NSW, 259 homes have been destroyed.\nWith months of firefighting ahead of them, fire chiefs are starting to worry about the fatigue and stress on volunteer firefighters. Now, as more dangerous fire weather is forecast, Beer and Pearman are asking what else they could have done as scientists who were sounding the early warning bells for the current suffering. Why did the science not lead to action?\n\u201cI would blame most of that on the lobbying\u201d,\u201d says Pearman, now 78. \u201cThat lobbying has been extremely powerful in a country driven by the resource sector that includes uranium, coal and gas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge reluctance to reign that part of our economy in with a more strategic perspective.\u201d\nThe story of Beer\u2019s paper starts with Pearman who, says Beer, deserves credit for driving climate change research within CSIRO in the 1980s.\nPearman had taken an early climate change scenario developed by colleagues Barrie Pittock and Henry Nix, and handed it to scores of specialist scientists across the country.\nPearman wanted to get a picture of how climate change might impact issues including Australia\u2019s agriculture, ecology, insurance industry, hydrology, irrigation, farmers and power generators.\n\u201cWe went to all these scientists and said, in a year, we want a paper prepared to see what it means for your area. That was the basis for Tom Beer\u2019s paper. That was a year before the Greenhouse \u201887 meeting \u2013 a watershed. At the end of the day it was a risk assessment. \u201d\nBeer recalls it this way. \u201cGraeme Pearman said to me, you do bushfires, and I clicked my heels and saluted, and just got on with it.\u201d\nThe task wasn\u2019t simple, and Beer\u2019s initial hopes that he would \u201cjust need to go and crank the computer handle\u201d were challenged. The climate scenario was based on global average temperatures going up by about 3.5C \u2013 but there are a lot more ingredients driving fires than just temperature.\nBeer says the devastating Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 had driven interest inside CSIRO for research. A national bushfire research unit was established, and he moved to Melbourne to work.\nThis interest in the issue, he says, was in contrast with the relative scepticism on climate of his boss, Brian Tucker, who was chief of CSIRO\u2019s atmospheric research division.\n\u201cTucker thought there was no future in this climate change business,\u201d says Beer, adding that Tucker was more interested in the prospects of an impending ice age. When Tucker left CSIRO, he took up a position at the Institute of Public Affairs, where he wrote articles sceptical of the risks of human caused climate change.\nBut, says Beer, \u201cTucker had Graeme Pearman breathing down his neck\u201d.\n\u201cIt would be wrong to say Tucker was holding [Pearman and Pittock] back, but he wasn\u2019t advancing or promoting their research either.\u201d\nBeer\u2019s paper was one of more than 50 presented at the 1987 conference, and then in a book that was 745 pages long. Beer did media interviews and travelled to the US to talk to wildfire specialists about his work.\nHe also got a \u201cblistering\u201d letter from a WA forestry director, attacking his findings as \u201cshoddy\u201d. \n\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d asks Beer. \u201cThey forget it, because there are no big bushfires for another 10 years.\u201d\nThat lack of major bushfires saw CSIRO\u2019s institutional interest wane on the issue, and after five years or so, Beer had moved away from researching bushfires. But that wasn\u2019t before he helped write a second paper in 1995 using more sophisticated climate models, which backed up his earlier findings.\nNow, Beer admits to being frustrated that the warnings coming from the CSIRO didn\u2019t turn into action. But there\u2019s also a sense of guilt.\n\u201cIf I had really believed how bad it was going to get, I should have been out there asking for more funding for firefighters,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI suppose I was young enough to believe that doing the science was going to be enough and miraculously, people would act on it. That was a naive view, but I think that was probably fairly common among working scientists.\u201d\nBeer retired from CSIRO in 2014 as the head of the climate research program. Pearman took over from Tucker as as the head of of the atmospheric research division, and retired in 2004.\nDuring his time at CSIRO, Pearman gave climate change presentations to prime ministers Hawke, Keating and Howard. \u201cThere was an opportunity to deliver a perspective to these leaders \u2026 yet it didn\u2019t seem to have an impact,\u201d Pearman says.\nWhat Pearman is seeing play out now, in the bushfire crisis and the drought, \u201cis what we were talking about at the Greenhouse 87 meeting. That was about the changes that we anticipated, based on basic physics of the climate system.\u201d\nDespite the fact that Pearman gave more than 500 presentations on climate change between 2000 and 2010, he still asks himself if he could have done more.\n\u201cWhat could I have done? What did I do wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cThere are times when you look and think, there\u2019s something we did wrong in trying to communicate this.\n\u201cThere are times when I get \u2013 maybe not quite as far as depressed \u2013 but I think that the value of the science investment is being belittled by people with ideological views on how the world is, rather than a view of the world that\u2019s based on observations.\u201d\nPearman is still active in climate issues as a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne\u2019s climate and energy college.\nHe reserves some criticism for his old organisation that he says has become too focussed on work to drive \u201ceconomic benefit\u201d. He knows, too, that human nature and psychology also blocks action.\nBut he reserves his rhetorical fire for the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThose investing in the fossil fuel industry worked diligently to try to stop action on the reduction of emissions,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a scientist you think many years ahead and out to the turn of the century and beyond.\n\u201cBut in a business with investment in a coal mine, their interest is in what happens in the next five years.

Additionally, the dataset is still found easily online and the government appears to have taken no steps to have it removed.\nThe breach so shocked the government, the then attorney general, George Brandis, quickly announced plans to criminalise the act of re-identifying previously de-identified data, although ultimately the legislation never passed before the 2019 election.\nIn September 2018, Teague went back to the department and alerted them to a TV journalist\u2019s data she had found in the dataset, and asked the department to notify them, or she would inform that journalist in 30 days.\nTeague also asked the department to inform all 2.5 million Australians in the dataset that their personal information was potentially compromised.\nInstead, the health department secretary, Glenys Beauchamp, wrote to University of Melbourne vice-chancellor Glyn Davis to complain about Teague\u2019s demands, stating there were significant \u201cpractical and legal barriers\u201d preventing the department from identifying people in the dataset and then notifying them.\nBeauchamp also requested Teague cease her work on the dataset.\n\u201cWe trust the university \u2026 continues to place great importance in respecting the privacy of the individuals included in the MBS/PBS dataset and request the university cease the work currently being done to attempt to re-identify individuals and destroy all copies of the dataset,\u201d Beauchamp said.\n\u201cWe also request the researchers not publish the names of individuals the researchers assert have been re-identified, the de-anonymisation methodology or other information that would potentially assist in the ease of re-identification.\u201d\nThe letter also raised concerns about a conference presentation on the methodology Teague ultimately ended up giving after the letter was sent.

It is national security. It is our economy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear I\u2019m not going to be carrying the ball,\u201d Inslee told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow when he announced his withdrawal from the race during a segment on her show. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be president, so I\u2019m withdrawing tonight from the race.\u201d\nInslee, who suspended his campaign on August 21, was the third Democrat to end his presidential campaign this year, after former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).\nFailures at Home\nAs governor of Washington, Inslee has repeatedly failed in his attempts to enact strict policies and laws limiting greenhouse gas emissions in the state. Voters twice rejected referendums Inslee endorsed to tax carbon-dioxide emissions; his efforts to cajole his fellow Democrats, who control Washington\u2019s legislature, to enact laws limiting carbon-dioxide emissions have failed; and in a case currently on appeal before the state\u2019s Supreme Court, regulations his administration enacted to restrict greenhouse gas emissions were struck down by a county superior court as being beyond the governor\u2019s power.\nDespite these setbacks in his home state, Inslee presented himself as a single-issue presidential candidate staking everything on fighting climate change.\n\u201cWe started [out] saying that climate change had to be the number one job of the United States,\u201d Inslee said on MSNBC.\nUndistinguished Climate Campaign\nClimate was already on Democrat voters\u2019 minds before Inslee joined the race.

Inslee also proposed reshaping U.S. foreign policy around climate change, mandating 100 percent clean energy production in the United States, banning sales of new cars not powered by electricity, and eliminating fossil fuel production in the United States.\nDemocrats have taken up climate change as a major campaign issue more for reasons of virtue-signaling than seriousness about enacting realistic energy policies, says Myers.\n\u201cI think climate change is a symbol for Democrats, more than a policy,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe policies that have been proposed on climate change are totally destructive and unworkable, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be a barrier for the Democrats\u2014effective and workable policies are not a prerequisite.\u201d\nSymbols Over Substance\nThe remaining candidates should take heed of Inslee\u2019s inability to gain traction among Democrat voters based on his single-minded focus on climate, says Myers.\n\u201cI think Inslee should be rather a lesson to Democrats, a warning to serious people about how climate change as a symbol has overtaken climate change as a rational policy,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone ever actually looked at Inslee\u2019s record in Washington State, which was miserable.\n\u201cVirtually none of his climate policies were ever adopted, and they were rejected by Democrats,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was ever taken seriously enough that people actually scrutinized his record.\u201d\nVivian E. Jones (vivianejones@aol.com)\u00a0writes from Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "label": 1}, "text-431": {"text": "Climate activists and the United Nations are suffering a major black eye this week as protests and riots resulting from high energy prices have erupted in Santiago,\u00a0Chile.\nChile, which will host a major U.N. climate conference in December, earned praise from climate activists for recently imposing a carbon dioxide tax on conventional energy sources and switching the Santiago Metro system to renewable power. Now, the people of Chile are rising up and firing a shot across the bow of other nations considering similar energy taxes and expensive renewable energy programs.\nOn Oct. 25, protestors took to the streets throughout Santiago in response to Metro fare hikes. The protests soon spread to other cities and led to rioting and at least five reported deaths. The Chilean government and the legacy media blamed the fare hikes on rising oil prices. But that isn\u2019t true.\nOil prices aren\u2019t rising. Global\u00a0oil prices\u00a0are currently 25 percent lower than they were a year ago and 37 percent lower than they were five years ago.\nIn Chile,\u00a0gasoline prices\u00a0reflect the lower oil prices. Chilean gasoline prices were $1.12 per liter in August (the most recent month for which data are available), compared to $1.28 a year ago. Five years ago, gasoline sold at $1.50.\nSantiago Metro fares are rising, amid falling oil and gasoline prices, because government officials in 2018\u00a0traded out\u00a0most of the Metro\u2019s energy sources to wind and solar power from conventional sources. The Chilean government also hit the portion of conventional power that remains with\u00a0new carbon dioxide taxes.\nAs a result, Chileans are now burdened by higher Metro fares reflecting unnecessary energy price increases. As Chileans protest, climate activists and their media allies want people to believe oil is to blame, rather than government climate programs that raise energy prices and impoverish people.\nUnlike speculative\u00a0climate change\u00a0woes that never seem to materialize, carbon dioxide taxes and renewable energy mandates immediately and measurably raise living costs and reduce living standards. In the United States, people may have some concern about climate change, but polling shows most Americans aren\u2019t willing\u00a0to pay $2 per month\u00a0to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\nIn Chile, where\u00a0per-capita income\u00a0is merely one-quarter of U.S. per-capita income, people are understandably even less willing to pay for carbon dioxide reduction. Moreover, Chile\u2019s per-capita income is higher than that of most other Latin American countries, so people in other Latin American countries would be even more likely to rise up and protest economically destructive climate change programs like the ones imposed in Chile.\nFor United Nations officials planning the 25th Conference of the Parties (COP25) climate conference, scheduled for the first two weeks of December in Santiago, the protests are especially embarrassing. Last year\u2019s U.N. conference took place in Poland, where government officials and the prominent Solidarity labor union have criticized costly U.N. climate programs. Solidarity even held a press conference at the U.N. event and issued a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0criticizing U.N. climate activism.\nThe December U.N. conference was originally scheduled for Brazil, but the Brazilian government strongly criticized U.N. climate activism and told the United Nations it\u00a0no longer desired to serve as host.\nThe Chilean government offered to host in Brazil\u2019s place, touting its carbon dioxide taxes, renewable-powered metro, and other activist climate programs. Yet, the world is seeing the Chilean population rioting in the streets as a result of those taxes and climate programs. This is the third major black eye for the U.N. Conference of the Parties in less than a year.\nThe Chilean protests, like the\u00a0Yellow Vest protests\u00a0that erupted in France a year ago, highlight how out of touch the international climate class is with the people they seek to govern and control. Faced with a choice between suffering certain lower living standards today or dealing with speculative climate change in the distant future, people wisely choose the latter.\nThat will continue to be the case until predicted climate harms actually materialize and negatively affect people, or until wind and solar power can economically compete with conventional energy. So far, neither has been the case.\n[Originally Published at Epoch Times]", "label": 1}, "text-432": {"text": "David Wallace-Wells: \u2018There are many cases of climate hypocrisy\u2019\nDavid Wallace-Wells is the deputy editor of New York magazine. In July 2017, he wrote a long-form essay about the dire prospects for human civilisation caused by the climate crisis. It became the most read article in the history of the magazine and led to a book, The Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future, which is being published in paperback in September.\nThe first line of your book states: \u201cIt is worse, much worse, than you think.\u201d If you were sitting down to write the book again, would you be inserting another \u201cmuch\u201d into that sentence? I still think the public aren\u2019t as concerned as they should be about some of the scary stuff that\u2019s possible this century. But I do think things have changed quite a bit. And I also think the politics have changed quite a lot. When I turned in the book in September, nobody had heard of Greta Thunberg. Nobody had heard of Extinction Rebellion. In the US, very few people had heard of Sunrise. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had not even been elected.\nIn the United States, you have a climate crisis denier as president, yet areas of the country are experiencing frequent flooding, more forest fires and rises in average temperature of more than 2C. How do you explain this? Actually, it\u2019s quite striking how many Americans do believe climate change is happening. [Democratic presidential nominee] Jay Inslee says 75% of voters want action, compared with 63% 12 months ago \u2013 that is remarkable. There was a piece earlier this month in the New York Times about how for many young Republicans, it is their top issue.\nThere is a pervasive techno-optimistic view that we can just invent something and it will solve the problem\nThere seems to be a division in the US Democratic nomination race between candidates who advocate wholesale system change such as the Green New Deal and others who favour a more incremental progress because they claim that\u2019s the only way to get laws passed. Which is the most effective approach? The science demands a quite systematic response; incremental policy simply isn\u2019t going to be adequate to avoid really terrible levels of warming. But ambitious legislation has to go through the Senate and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a scenario where a Democratic president takes office in 2021 with more than 60 Democratic votes [a three-fifths majority].\nOn the other hand, the last few administrations have gotten quite creative in how to use what\u2019s called \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d, which you can use to pass stuff through the Senate with only 51 votes [a simple majority] by defining legislation as essentially budget-based. That\u2019s one reason why you see so many of the Democrats\u2019 plans are essentially investment programmes.\nInslee has been more ambitious in putting forward details about how he would regulate the fossil fuel business but some of the other campaigns have basically just put forward a sort of Green New Deal or green Marshall Plan \u2013 a massive spending programme directed at green energy projects.\nYou\u2019re hopeful that technologies like geoengineering and carbon capture will play a significant role in mitigating temperature rise. Some environmentalists and scientists argue that these unproven methods can\u2019t bail us out, and that they give licence to the fossil fuel industry to carry on polluting\u2026 I look at the science and say if we\u2019re defining a comfortable world [as] staying below two degrees of warming, I just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any way we can achieve that without a really quite dramatic amount of negative emissions.\nBut I\u2019m also very mindful that there is a pervasive techno-optimistic view \u2013 especially among wealthy Americans \u2013 that we can just invent something and it will solve the problem.\nThe UN says we need to halve global emissions by 2030 to avoid catastrophic warming. We\u2019re really deeply deluded about how quickly new technology can scale and can be deployed. We\u2019re far from having a 747 flying on a zero-carbon fuel.\nWe can agree to decarbonise \u2013 rethink our agriculture, aim for a meatless diet and so on \u2013 but we don\u2019t live in a global, centralised command-and-control economy. Every country has its own political interests. How do you make the world take collective action? That\u2019s harder than the technological problem. There are many cases of what I think of as climate hypocrisy, for example, Canada declaring a climate emergency and then the very next day approving a new oil pipeline.\nEach individual nation could be quite aggressive in their decarbonisation and yet be living through the exact same climate that there would be if they took no action unless the rest of the world followed suit. No major industrial nation is on track to meet its commitments under Paris.\nMy own hope is that I see almost half of our global emissions being produced by two countries \u2013 the US and China. Maybe it\u2019s naive, but I hope a cooperative pact can be reached between the two countries like the nuclear non-proliferation agreements that were made between the US and Russia in the cold war. The two nations remained rivals but were nevertheless jointly committed to protecting the planet from an existential threat.\nIf the US and China really took aggressive leadership on this issue, the collective action problem would become less important \u2013 the world\u2019s most powerful countries have a way of bending the will of the less powerful.\nWe need to fight\u00a0to make the world one we want to live in, rather than\u00a0giving up hope before the fight is\u00a0really over\nSome environmentalists argue that we need to rethink economic growth \u2013 we need to reorient our expectations of the conveniences and luxuries of modern life\u2026 I don\u2019t yet have a firm perspective on this. My intuition is that we don\u2019t need to abandon the prospect of economic growth to get a handle on climate change.\nI look at the case of the US and I see that if the average American had the carbon emissions of the average EU citizen, the country\u2019s emissions would fall by 60%. And I think most Americans would be happy with those lifestyles.\nThe American electricity grid loses two-thirds of all energy produced as waste heat. We discard something like 50% or 60% of all of our food. So we could achieve some quite significant emissions gains.\nDo you still think of yourself as a journalist or have you morphed into an activist? I do still think of myself as a journalist. And I don\u2019t know how long that will last. I still feel like a chronicler of the story rather than a protagonist. I\u2019m really heartened and excited by all of the new activist energy that we\u2019ve seen over the last year.\nMillennials are expressing doubts about having children because of the environmental crisis \u2013 they are concerned that their grandchildren and possibly their own children will be living in an inhospitable and volatile world. You have recently had a child\u2026 My intuition is that we need to fight to make the world the one we want to live in rather than giving up hope before the fight is really over. The world is going to get warmer. Almost inevitably, there will be a lot more pain and suffering in it than we have now. But how much is really up to us.\nAt what point should panic set in? It\u2019s plausible there\u2019ll be four degrees of warming by the end of the century, which would mean mass migration from areas such as the Middle East and Asia to newly temperate areas such as Siberia and Greenland. That\u2019s not a very smooth transition for human civilisation. It seems hard to imagine. Yet we\u2019re already seeing some fair amount of panic. The significant amount of human migration we\u2019re seeing in the US coming from Central America, for example.\nI am personally horrified by the way our politics are beginning to adjust to them. We need to be much more open-hearted and attentive to the suffering of those around the world rather than closed off and hard-hearted, which is how almost all of the countries of the west have been over the last decade to refugees.\nWe\u2019re also seeing panic in the protest movements, which are essentially declarations that existing power structures and priorities are simply not sufficient to address this crisis in the terms that it demands.\n\u2022 David Wallace-Wells will be giving a Guardian Live talk about the climate emergency at 7pm on Wednesday 11 September at Kings Place, north London.

What we need to have is a clear roadmap of how the discussions of financing will allow us to have a clear idea of commitments by 2015.\u201d\nEven low expectations like Ortega\u2019s were dashed when, on the opening day of the climate talks, November 11, Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Tony Abbott\u2019s government produced a document, outlining its position at the Warsaw conference, which boldly\u00a0stated: \u201cFederal cabinet has ruled that Australia will not sign up to any new contributions, taxes or charges at this week\u2019s global summit on climate change.\u201d The Australian points out: \u201cThis rules out Australia playing any role in a wealth transfer from rich countries to developing nations to pay them to decrease their carbon emissions.\u201d But, perhaps, the most dramatic line in the government document is: Australia \u201cwill not support any measures which are socialism masquerading as environmentalism.\u201d\nA few days later, November 15, Japan\u00a0announced\u00a0that \u201cits emissions would increase slightly rather than fall 25 per cent as promised in 2009.\u201d Japan was struggling to meet its previous emissions promises\u2014which were the most aggressive of any big developed country\u2014even before the Fukushima accident prompted the shutdown of its 50 still-operable nuclear reactors and its corresponding rise in the supplemental use of fossil fuels.\nThen on November 20, news came out of England stating that Prime Minister Cameron is\u00a0telling\u00a0everyone: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of all this green crap.\u201d\nAll of this is on the foundation of Todd Stern, the Obama Administration\u2019s chief climate diplomat, dialing back expectations when, during an October 22\u00a0speech\u00a0in London, he addressed U.S. involvement: \u201can international agreement is by no means the whole answer.\u201d He pointed out \u201cthe need to be creative and flexible\u201d and acknowledged the \u201chard reality\u201d that \u201cno step change in overall levels of public funding from developed countries is likely to come anytime soon.\u201d Stern added: \u201cThe fiscal reality of the United States and other developed countries is not going to allow it.\u201d\nToward the end of the conference, \u201csix environment and development groups walked out, saying the annual round of talks had delivered little more than hot air.\u201d A statement from Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Oxfam, ActionAid, the International Trade Union Confederation and Friends of the Earth\u00a0said: \u201cThe Warsaw climate conference, which should have been an important step in the just transition to a sustainable future, is on track to deliver virtually nothing.\u201d Samantha Smith, leader of the WWF\u2019s climate and energy initiative called the meeting a \u201cfarce.\u201d She told the FT: \u201cFinance is one of the big reasons we walked out. Expectations were that developed countries were going to put money on the table, but what happened when we got here was exactly the opposite.\u201d\nIn a\u00a0statement, Smith blamed: \u201cJapan's announcement that it would not reduce emissions as promised, Australia\u2019s decision to end its carbon tax and Canada\u2019s congratulating the latter on its new climate policy.\u201d\nJust as it looked like predictions of collapse would come true, a last-minute compromise came through in overtime: the Warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage (IMLD). Stern led the 36 straight hours of \u201cbad-tempered negotiations\u201d\u2014including a standoff between the US and developing nations\u2014in which \u201ccountries of the South \u2026 finally won.\u201d\nAddressing the IMLD, the Associated Press (AP)\u00a0reports: \u201cagreements were watered down to a point where no country was promising anything concrete.\u201d While the IMLD was agreed upon, according to\u00a0The Hindu, \u201cdeciding how this mechanism would get the funds in future\u201d remained unresolved. And, BusinessGreen.com\u00a0bemoans: \u201cthe vague wording fell short of the kind of detailed commitments on additional funding and avoided a commitment to compensation that many developing nations had been seeking.\u201d\nSo, while a deal was reached that\u00a0allows\u00a0\u201cjust enough to keep things moving,\u201d little is really expected. The AP states: \u201cIn two-decades, the U.N. talks have failed to provide a cure to the world\u2019s fever.\u201d Even Connie Hedegaard, European climate commissioner, acknowledges: \u201cthe process needs to provide a \u2018substantive answer\u2019 to global warming in two years to remain relevant.\u201d\nFortunately, Mother Nature can\u2019t be bought. Despite the billions the world\u2019s wealthy nations have provided to poorer countries, global CO2 emissions have continued to rise. As the Washington Post\u00a0reports, from 2010-2012 only about $5 billion of the $35 billion actually went toward helping poor countries prepare for actual climate change impacts. $100 billion per year is expected by 2020 but \u201cmost developed countries are failing to demonstrate promised increases.\u201d\nBritain was one of the \u201cwealthier nations\u201d to promise billions in aid, but it is balking, too. Ed Davey, energy and climate secretary, believes that paying additional compensation to poorer nations is \u201cnot fair or sensible.\u201d The Telegraph\u00a0states: \u201cGrowing numbers of Tory backbenchers are now calling for the government to withdraw from expensive climate change and carbon commitments.\u201d\nDouglas Carswell, Tory MP, sums up the so-called climate compensations: \u201cWe\u2019re spending money that we don\u2019t have to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist at the behest of people we didn\u2019t elect.\u201d\nCanada, Australia, Britain, and even Japan\u2014home of the landmark Kyoto climate talks two decades ago\u2014are coming to their senses. The US held out until the very last minute\u2014and then capitulated by agreeing to the IMLD.\nIt really is all about the money. The Abbott Administration has stated: Australia\u2019s efforts on greenhouse gases will be conditioned by \u201cfiscal circumstances.\u201d Japan, acknowledges its need for energy: \u201cAlthough Japan\u2019s economy is one of the world\u2019s most energy efficient, the country is still the fifth-biggest CO2 emitter, owing to its large-scale concentration of manufacturing industries.\u201d Britain\u2019s Carswell says: \u201cThe rethinks that have happened in Japan and Australia and elsewhere desperately need to happen here as well.\u201d Ditto for America.

You will find sports masseurs making snide jokes about candles and whale music, and regular masseurs reminding the world that you don\u2019t need to wear Lycra to understand anatomy. It wasn\u2019t until I spoke to Kate Kahle, a sports massage therapist for 25 years, that I really understood. \u201cSports massage usually just targets a specific issue,\u201d she said. \u201cA regular massage will be the whole body. So a client might come in with shoulder problems, and as well as looking at the part that\u2019s hurting, I look for the connections too.\u201d In other words: regular massage makes you feel relaxed; sports massage stops things hurting.\nI have never been interested in massage: I\u2019ve always taken the opportunity to go immediately to sleep, missed the fabled benefits, then jolted into consciousness at 50 minutes, startled and a bit ashamed, wondering what he or she had to do to wake me up.\nThen I hurt my neck, and had a sports massage from someone a friend recommended. It was an experience that cleared up the mystery of why, when you ask someone if they know an acupuncturist, for example, they\u2019ll say, \u201cI went to a brilliant guy, once, but he did puncture someone\u2019s lung and I can\u2019t remember his name,\u201d whereas when you cast around for a sports massage therapist, people fall to their knees. The person they know is an angel; a miracle worker. Plainly, if there\u2019s one thing people really like, it\u2019s when things stop hurting.\n\u201cEvery massage therapist has to have a basic anatomy and physiology qualification,\u201d Kahle explains, \u201cbut when you\u2019re trying to solve problems, you have to know how everything connects, where the attachment points are, how the circulatory system works.\u201d\nMuscles like to be stretched; tendons and ligaments, not so much. A good therapist can feel something deeper than tightness or tension; they can feel your heat in their fingers. \u201cThere will be increased blood circulation to injured areas,\u201d says Kahle. \u201cThat\u2019s the body\u2019s way of saying there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nWherever that problem is, it most likely either didn\u2019t start there or will lead to something worse: that\u2019s part of the talismanic property of the massage therapist \u2013 locating the source of the damage. It turns out that if your neck is killing you and you can\u2019t even remember using it for sport, it might not even have been sport that did the damage; it could just as well be related to your sedentary lifestyle, to the way you cradle a phone between your ear and shoulder, to the ricocheting impact of one muscle\u2019s tension upon another\u2019s recovery.\nIn truth, I\u2019ve been putting my neck out now and then for 20 years. I\u2019ve tried everything: acupuncture, osteopathy, even asking the GP. Everything helps eventually, but nothing works as fast as this.

She believes she and her white Swedish teenage friends have to save the world from us terrible oldies who created the oil and coal industries.\nShe will be appalled by the plea of India\u2019s coal secretary, Subhash Chandra Garg, that India must urgently expand its coal production from 600 million tonnes a year to a billion tonnes per year to meet basic energy needs. Yet Garg is right. Thunberg made headlines by sailing to the US in a solar-powered-ship to avoid using fuel oil. Does she have any idea of the enormous electricity used to produce the solar cells in her ship?\nIndia is a lower middle income country. Sweden is among the richest. Despite the green sermons, Sweden\u2019s annual per capita carbon emissions are 4.5 metric tonnes, higher than India (1.7 metric tonnes), Pakistan (0.9 metric tonnes) or Bangladesh (0.5 metric tonnes). South Asians can double their carbon emissions without matching Sweden\u2019s prodigality.\nWidespread activist attempts to stop all oil and coal production are hypocritical. A total switch to solar and wind energy is impossible since these are produced only intermittently when the sun shines and wind blows, maybe 25% of the year on an average. For the rest of the time, India needs coal-based electricity. Maybe new electric storage technology will ultimately change that, but today India needs massive coal expansion for thermal power.\nCurrent carbon emissions are just the tip of the iceberg. More than 90% of historical carbon emissions since the industrial revolution are the cumulative emissions of rich western countries and Japan. The share of developing countries, including India, is a tiny fraction. Sorry Greta, the problem is not that grown-ups like me have ruined your future but that rich Swedes are still emitting more carbon than coal-using Indians.\nEconomist Kirit Parikh once framed India\u2019s policy as being \u201cwe will never emit more carbon per capita than the West\u201d. This would allow India to raise its emissions six-fold or more without being worse than others. Modi has embraced renewables massively. Even so, for round-the-clock power, India will have to create much more coal-based capacity. If the West develops viable carbon-capture technologies, India will happily adopt those.\nThe greatest carbon emitters are small oil producers and island economies, led by Qatar (43.9 metric tonnes). Of the industrialised countries, the USA is easily the biggest emitter (16.5 metric tonnes) followed by Australia (15.4 metric tonnes), Canada (15.2 metric tonnes), Russia (11.9 metric tonnes), Japan (9.5 metric tonnes) and Germany (8.9 metric tonnes).\nCoal India Ltd is a truly third-rate coal producer. Despite Modi\u2019s rah-rah talk of renewables, imports of thermal coal in 2018 grew at a record 19% to 172 million tonnes. This is insane because India has the third largest coal reserves in the world. For India to be importing coal is like Kuwait to be importing oil. It is crazy.\nIndia nationalised coal in the 1970s in the belief that the public sector would optimise coal production. What a hope! In underground mines, India\u2019s output per man shift (OMS) is a pathetic 0.8 tonnes against no less than 40 tonnes in Australia. In open cast mines, India has improved recently from an OMS of 8.6 tonnes in 2007-08 to 16.6 tonnes in 2017-18, but this is still way behind Australia\u2019s best (75 tonnes). Enough said.\nPolitical parties have over the years slowly and reluctantly, chipped away at Coal India\u2019s monopoly. First private production was allowed but only for captive consumption. Last year, full commercial mining was allowed, but no auctions took place. Earlier, foreign companies were allowed only a 25% stake in coal, but finally in August 100% FDI was allowed by the automatic route.\nIs this too late? Globally, coal mining giants are under fire by activist investors and NGOs, and some are selling coal assets. The World Bank and some other financiers will not finance coal mines. But Indian banks will. India is one of the few countries where coal still has a big future for at least a decade or two.\nGarg argues, rightly, for auctioning massive world-sized coal blocks, not the small ones of past years. Environmental and tribal clearance, plus railway links, must be obtained in advance, so that projects do not stall halfway. This requires a sea-change in culture that is absolutely necessary.

This is a groundbreaking legal decision that could effect future infrastructure developments and puts the UK\u2019s commitment to cut emission to net zero by 2050 at the forefront of future policymaking.\nWhat will happen next?\nThe government has been told by the court of appeal to declare its decision to allow Heathrow airport expansion - contained in its airline national policy statement - illegal. Ministers have two choices now. They can withdraw the whole policy statement or try to amend it to make it compatible with the UK\u2019s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\u00a0\nWill the runway be built?\nIf the government can prove that expanding Heathrow is compatible with its commitments under the Paris agreement to very radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the runway may go ahead. But the prime minister has always been against the third runway, and the government has told the court it will not be appealing against its decision on Thursday.\u00a0\nThere now hangs a very big question mark over whether the bulldozers will ever start work on the runway.\nThey argued that the then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, acted unlawfully when he agreed to the expansion of Heathrow in the government\u2019s airports national policy statement in June 2018 \u2013 he had failed to take into account the UK\u2019s international obligations under the Paris agreement, and its own domestic law.\nThe judges\u2019 ruling in favour of the campaign groups puts both the need for the UK to make significant reductions in emissions and the requirements of the Paris agreement at the forefront of policymaking. It is a judgment that could have lasting implications for future infrastructure projects.\nThe ruling strikes a warning note that the climate crisis means it can no longer be business as usual. In future, for economic and business decisions to have both legal standing and political credibility they must take into account the impact on global heating.\nThis ruling comes in the year the UK\u2019s trustworthiness on these issues comes under the global spotlight, as the government hosts the key UN international climate talks, Cop26, in Glasgow in November.\nIn the long history of Heathrow\u2019s planned expansion, during which both Labour and Conservative governments have backed a third runway, those protesting that its environmental impact is just too great have seemed to be the underdogs.\nArguments about increased air pollution and noise pollution, and the severe negative consequences of, in effect, tacking a new airport with the capacity of Gatwick on to Heathrow, have been met by politicians and business leaders contending that expansion is vital to the UK\u2019s economic prosperity.\nNothing, Grayling said last year, must stop this \u201cmassive economic boost\u201d.\nNow it seems the impact of human activity on the planet has outweighed the economic holy grail of Heathrow expansion.\nBut campaigners \u2013 some of whom have been fighting for decades to stop the runway \u2013 will hold in the back of their minds the words of another Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, even as they celebrate the appeal court ruling.\nCameron promised them in 2010: \u201cNo ifs, no buts, no new runway,\u201d only to commission a report which paved the way for the runway to be approved.\nThis latest legal challenge \u2013 at a time of acute and growing public concern about climate change \u2013 might just prove decisive for Heathrow Airport Ltd, and political supporters of its project. The make-up of parliament has also changed considerably since the Commons voted in favour of the third runway in 2018.\nThe judges did not cancel the expansion, but they have thrown a big, perhaps insurmountable, obstacle in its path \u2013 and given Boris Johnson, who as a backbench MP threatened to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop a third runway, a compelling reason to scrap it.", "label": 0}, "text-438": {"text": "'Key worker': how a 19th-century term evolved into political rhetoric\nWhat is the minimum necessary amount of activity for a modern industrial society to continue to function? One answer to that is to classify certain citizens as \u201ckey workers\u201d: people who work in health, food, transport, utilities, and so forth. Though this phrase has the doomy smell of modern bureaucratic jargon (as in key stakeholders, key performance indicators, and the like), it is actually more than a century old.\nSome years ago a Whitehall style guide tried to ban the adjectival use of \u201ckey\u201d to mean \u201cimportant\u201d \u2013 rather quixotically, since this sense has been around since the mid-19th century. Within a few decades, the first \u201ckey workers\u201d appeared: they were telegraph operators (who literally pressed keys in Morse code), or, more punningly, burglars who picked locks. In the mid-20th century \u201ckey worker\u201d acquired its present, chiefly British, sense of people considered essential to maintaining the productive peace of entire communities.\nIn modern times, though, \u201ckey worker\u201d has often been used as a rhetorical pat on the head to those whom society nonetheless deems unworthy of pay commensurate with their social importance.

Soon, the reins of government would be taken by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, committed to a programme of austerity that would still be making its effects felt a decade later. But for another fortnight, Gordon Brown would be prime minister, and he was on a walkabout in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. It was there that he was introduced to 65-year-old Gillian Duffy.\nSurrounded by men in suits, and accompanied by the snap of cameras, Duffy ran through a mess of grievances \u2013 about the tax she had to pay on her pension, the state of the national finances, and a benefits system she claimed paid out to people who \u201caren\u2019t vulnerable\u201d while denying help to those who needed it. She reached a climax with a single broken sentence about immigration: \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything about the immigrants\u2026 but all these easterns European what are coming in, where are they flocking from?\u201d Still wearing a radio microphone pinned to his lapel by Sky News, Brown then got back in his car, and let rip. \u201cShe\u2019s just this sort of bigoted woman who said she used to be a Labour voter,\u201d he said.\nThe media bowed to the inevitable and called the episode \u201cBigotgate\u201d. And over the next five or six years, Duffy became a minor political celebrity. Thanks to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight and a piece she wrote for the Daily Mirror, we know that she enthusiastically voted Leave in the 2016 referendum \u2013 partly, she said, because, \u201cI love being English, and I don\u2019t want to be a European.\u201d\nThere is a leftwing version of populism. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world\nHer small place in political history should be assured, because her encounter with Brown represented the first stirrings \u2013 in Britain, anyway \u2013 of changes wrought by people and places far from the usual centres of power. Duffy remained loyal to the Labour party, which was soon tying itself in knots about how to appeal to such voters, eventually offering its members mugs emblazoned with the words \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d. But here and elsewhere, lots of other people embraced parties that \u2013 and I\u2019m being generous here \u2013 viewed their small \u201cc\u201d conservative, nationalistic instincts and hostility to political establishment as a giant political opportunity.\nThanks to a term that dates back to the 19th century, we know it as populism: to quote from the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201ca political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups\u201d. There is a leftwing version of populism, seen lately in the way Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is campaigning in the general election, against an \u201cestablishment elite\u201d and \u201crigged system\u201d. But it is the rightwing iteration that has spread around the world.\nUkip got only 3.1% of the national vote in 2010, but by the end of 2016, Nigel Farage had played a key role in the leave side\u2019s referendum victory. Europe has been shaken by such hard-right populist parties as Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), the Sweden Democrats, the revived French National Front (these days known as National Rally), and Italy\u2019s Northern League. At the same time, the world has seen the rise of a new breed of populist \u201cstrongmen\u201d, defined by their hostility to the conventions of democracy and gleeful embrace of prejudice and bigotry. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n began his second stint as prime minister in 2010. Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdo\u011fan became president in 2014; India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, took power in the same year. Five years later came the election victory of perhaps the most reckless populist of them all: Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, who replied to a congratulatory tweet from Donald Trump thus: \u201cTogether, under God\u2019s protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people!\u201d\nWhich brings us to the big orange baby in the White House. Back in 2011, as the Labour party licked its wounds and Farage began to push his way into the political mainstream, Trump was slowly edging towards the US presidency, a prize on which he had fixed his eyes in the past. In 2011, a poll in the Wall Street Journal put him in front of all the Republican contenders. Not long after, he jumped on a conspiracy theory that dated back to 2008, questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the US, and demanding to see the president\u2019s birth certificate. This mischief laid the path to 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy with a characteristically rambling speech delivered in Trump Tower, in New York.\n\u201cOur country is in serious trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\u2019s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us\u2026 When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026 They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u2026 I\u2019ve watched the politicians\u2026. They\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests\u2026 the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\u201d\nHere was every key facet of populism, in full, shameless effect: racism, the rejection of free trade and globalisation, and a self-serving loathing of supposed elites, made all the more ludicrous by the fact that it was voiced by a billionaire. What Trump said may have regularly tumbled into incoherence and contradiction, but it was also built around a winning slogan stolen from Ronald Reagan, which Trump registered as a trademark in November 2012: \u201cMake America great again\u201d. And if he was gauche and inarticulate, maybe that was the point: here was someone so far from the usual polished politicians that his speeches didn\u2019t even have a clear beginning, middle and end.\nIn 2016, I watched Trump do his thing at a rally in Evansville, Indiana, a faded place with a dilapidated downtown, where a refrigerator factory that had once employed 10,000 people had closed six years before, something locals blamed on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the way it had incentivised moving jobs to Mexico. He rambled on about the economic threat from China, the need to bring jobs back to America, and his fabled border wall. The 12,000-strong crowd roared their approval. I recognised many of them as kindred spirits of voters I\u2019d spoken to in Britain: older, anxious, often angry white people, wondering what had happened to the world they knew, and where on earth everything was going next.\n***\nWhy now? Obviously, it is no accident that populism began its rebirth only a couple of years after the 2008 crash, and the spectacle of reckless financiers taking the global economy to the brink of disaster but suffering almost no comeback. To compound people\u2019s sense of injustice, the long slump that followed has seen wages stagnate, and changes to the world of work that have made more and more jobs insecure, and poorly paid. These developments exacerbated resentments that went back years, into the deindustralisation and automation that had been eating away at people and places\u2019 collective esteem for decades. Rochdale, the home of Duffy, was once a thriving mill town and the birthplace of the co-operative movement. Trump won the presidency thanks to support in rust belt states \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania \u2013 carried by the Democrats in previous elections. The Sweden Democrats are strongest in the old industrial towns and cities of southern Sweden; AfD\u2019s bedrock is the deprived former industrial areas of the old East.\nI spoke to voters responsible for Farage\u2019s surge. One talked warmly of Margaret Thatcher\nFor sure, populism appeals to affluent voters who live in more comfortable places, and who seem to see the new forces of populism as a logical next step from their past support for traditional parties of the right. Trump, let us not forget, is a Republican, whose victory depended on affluent voters in the party\u2019s usual strongholds; the bedrock of support for Ukip \u2013 and Brexit \u2013 came from Tories in the party\u2019s traditional heartlands.\nSix years ago, the Guardian sent me to the east of England to speak to some of the activists and voters responsible for Farage\u2019s surge: going back now to what I wrote then, among the most striking things is the sense that lifelong Tories saw Ukip as an answer to their belief that the Conservatives were no longer Conservative enough. I met retired estate agents, former middle managers, the owners of small businesses, who talked of the second world war, their antipathy to immigration, and the idea that Britain was a \u201cChristian country\u201d. Another of my interviewees was a former policeman, who rather suggested the Duffy worldview shifted to the right. He spoke warmly of Margaret Thatcher. \u201cShe looked after the armed forces and the police, and I\u2019m all for that,\u201d he told me. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re becoming a third-world country, really, the way we\u2019re going.\u201d\nHe lived in Rayleigh, in Essex, not exactly on its last legs. But neither the referendum nor the presidency would have been won without the support of those whose experience of modernity was bound up with loss and hardship, and who proved to be open to a politics of nostalgia and score-settling. The point is to make America great again, and to take back control. It is part of the same basic message that populism also yearns for a return to the glories of the nation state, and the pushing back of globalisation, international trade deals \u2013 and, obviously, the EU. \nMeanwhile, the forces of economics and technology push the world in the opposite direction. Whatever its troubles, our planet is more connected than ever before. The movement of people is a simple fact of life, along with the diversity and change that come with it. But for reasons that seem to fuse insecurity and fear with base prejudice, some people do not like these things at all, which is one of the reasons why the refugee crisis of 2015 marked such a watershed moment for many European populists. Muslim people are a scapegoat to which populists return, time and again; so, too, are Jews. \nThere are echoes of the fascism and antisemitism of the 1930s. But populism is also deeply modern. It has prospered over the last 10 years not just because of the way that economies have changed, but because social media platforms have proved to be the ideal outlet for its furies. Their algorithms promote anything vivid, angry and sensationalist, and incubate endless conspiracy theories. Facebook, as a matter of policy, allows political advertisements that tell lies. Modi and his people deftly manipulate WhatsApp, using a network of an estimated 900,000 online activists to collect data about voters, and foment useful controversies; with echoes of anti-Obama birtherism, Modi supporters have claimed that the establishment Nehru-Gandhi family, which still dominates India\u2019s Congress party, are secret followers of Islam. Recent research into German politics found that 85% of Facebook posts from political parties came from AfD. There is a great irony here, in liberal northern Californians encouraging a huge revolt against everything they stand for, but history usually moves in strange, often contradictory ways.\nFive years before Brown met Duffy, I was in Brighton, writing my first feature for the Guardian at the Labour party conference. Brown\u2019s old colleague and adversary Tony Blair was in his pomp, delivering a big speech that advised anyone watching that the world was being transformed at speed, and their basic choice was to either get with it, or sink. \u201cI hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer\u2026 The character of this changing world is indifferent to tradition. Unforgiving of frailty. No respecter of past reputations. It has no custom and practice. It is replete with opportunities, but they go only to those swift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change.\u201d\nEven back then, the words sounded so arrogant and hubristic that they almost invited people to prove Blair wrong. So it followed: in retrospect, he voiced a great deal of what drove people across the world into the arms of the new populists. The lesson of the last decade is that millions of people do not want to adapt or change, and their complaints are likely to continue. For the foreseeable future, the opportunistic politicians who claim to represent them are going to be at the heart of yet another contradiction: Trump, Farage, Orb\u00e1n and the rest attract the votes of people who want the world to return to the past; but their mission is to push us into a chaotic, ugly future we cannot yet imagine.\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "label": 0}, "text-440": {"text": "Brazil: Bolsonaro's defiance of distancing criticized by health minister\nBrazil\u2019s health minister has publicly defied President Jair Bolsonaro over coronavirus, accusing him of sowing doubt in Brazilian minds over the need for physical distancing.\nIn a Sunday night interview with Brazil\u2019s most-watched television network, Luiz Henrique Mandetta signalled that Bolsonaro\u2019s insistence on snubbing health ministry distancing recommendations was confusing the country\u2019s 210 million citizens.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know whether to listen to the health minister or to the president,\u201d Mandetta said.

ADF rejects that label.\nOne of its most famous recent cases was of a baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The group argued baking was his form of artistic expression, and won. In another, the group successfully argued the arts and crafts company Hobby Lobby should not be required to pay for birth control included in private insurance plans, because of the owner\u2019s Christian faith.\nADF counts the former Trump-appointed US attorney general Jeff Sessions as an ally, and its founders are a who\u2019s-who list of opponents of gay rights. And this American group is busy abroad too.\nLast month, after a series of anti-abortion protests at Cardiff University in Wales, it was reported that ADF International had been reminding universities of their responsibilities to protect freedom of speech.\nLaurence Wilkinson, legal counsel for ADF International said: \u201cOur London office has been glad to support students facing censorship. On every occasion, when challenged with the robust legal protections which exist for speech, the university body has relented. That is something that all who care about free speech should be able to celebrate.\u201d\n\nIn the last decade, ADF attorneys argued in favor of state-sanctioned sterilization for trans people at the European Court of Human Rights. Their brief argued, \u201cequal dignity does not mean that every sexual orientation warrants equal respect\u201d.\nIn Belize, the group sided with another organization pushing to criminalize gay sex. In India, the executive director applauded a supreme court decision ruling gay sex illegal (that was struck down in 2018). In Romania, ADF pushed for a referendum to oppose same-sex civil unions. In Jamaica, ADF attorneys defended anti-sodomy laws.\nMeanwhile, in US states, the group has worked to craft legislation and defend \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws. These laws often give secular, public-facing businesses the right to refuse customers or perform services.\nNow, in the years since public sentiment and the law has swung in favor of same-sex marriage, groups who once opposed legal unions have worked on to curtail trans rights. Many have honed in on trans girls in particular, and alleged dangers they cause to cis women.\nPeople who have transitioned often have gender dysphoria, a recognized medical condition in which sex assigned at birth is incongruant with a person\u2019s gender identity. ADF\u2019s Connecticut lawsuit claims three cis female high school runners are being unfairly outcompeted by two trans sprinters, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood.\n\u201cThe essence of this argument is if you protect transgender people, this violates the rights of other people,\u201d said Chase Strangio, deputy director for trans justice at the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU is representing the trans girls named in the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit seeks to establish a chromosomal standard for girls\u2019 high school sports \u2013 that only people with XX chromosomes should be able to compete, Strangio said.\n\u201cThe starting premise is that trans girls are not girls, and the second premise is that boys are always better, stronger, faster than girls,\u201d said Strangio.\nYearwood and Miller issued statements vehemently defending their right to run in girls\u2019 events. \u201cI have faced discrimination in every aspect of my life and I no longer want to remain silent,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI am a girl and I am a runner.\u201d\n\u201cConnecticut has had plenty of trans athletes who are good or fine or bad,\u201d said Strangio. \u201cWhat\u2019s rare is having two examples of transgender girls who are good \u2013 and that\u2019s what bothers people.\u201d\nThe ADF was founded in 1995 by a who\u2019s who of white, anti-gay, Christian men. Among them are men like D James Kennedy, the late pastor of a Florida megachurch who played a critical role in the rise of conservative Christianity in the US.\nThe group\u2019s \u201c800lb gorilla\u201d, in Clarkson\u2019s words, is James Dobson. His large and influential organization Focus on the Family has opposed same-sex marriage for decades. Fellow founder Alan Sears wrote the 2003 book: The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today.\nADF\u2019s legal work has earned the group glowing reviews from friendly media, such as Fox News, where host Laura Ingraham recently included Holcomb on her high-profile show.\nBut ADF\u2019s Connecticut lawsuit is, in part, an acknowledgement that earlier tactics have failed.\nJust a few years ago, Christian legal groups were pushing \u201cbathroom bills\u201d across the country. The laws would have banned trans people from using the public toilet of their choice, arguing that woman would be in danger from other trans women. There is no evidence to support the claim.\nBathroom bill referendums failed in Massachusetts, California and Alaska, and legislative efforts tanked in many more, including conservative states like Alabama and Arkansas. In place of the bathroom bills, ADF\u2019s new Connecticut lawsuit has put faces and names to those who it alleges are victimized by inclusive policies.\nOther groups, such as the American Principles Project, are testing the electoral success of this message in states like Kentucky. The group is running adverts which argue trans girls will destroy women\u2019s sports, in an effort to re-elect the Republican incumbent governor.\nThe group\u2019s president, Frank Cannon, told the New York Times last year that polling showed that messaging emphasizing sports, especially children in sports, was more likely to move the needle with voters. It gives people \u201cthe idea that you are taking something away from people. And that\u2019s where they don\u2019t like it\u201d.\nOne of the three cis runners at the center of the lawsuit, Chelsea Mitchell, recently won against Miller in a 55m race. So far, ADF has refused to take a position on trans men competing in cis men\u2019s sports.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to take a position on that at this point,\u201d said Holcomb said. \u201cWhat we are really clear on, is it not fair for males to compete in the female category.\u201d\nThe largest-ever study of how trans athletes perform after transitioning is still being conducted in the UK, but only includes 20 people.\n\u201cUntil we have several of these larger-scale studies done worldwide, it\u2019s hard to be truly definitive on anything,\u201d the medical physicist Joanna Harper told the CBC. Harper is a trans woman, a long-distance runner and an advisor to the International Olympic Committee. She said she saw her own performance drop off after hormone therapy, and that such could be the case with other trans athletes.\nNo openly trans person has ever competed in the Olympics, although it has been allowed since 2004, under guidelines laying out how much testosterone an athlete can have in their body. But that rule too is being challenged \u2013 not by a trans athlete or a Christian group, but by a South African intersex running star. Intersex people are born with anatomy that doesn\u2019t easily fall into male or female.\n\u201cWe get down to micro-details of this abortion case or that LGBTQ+ case or prayer in the schools, but those are details,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cIt may use nationalist ideas when you\u2019re working within a specific culture and legal code, but their religious and political vision is global, and needs to be understood in that context.\u201d\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 March 2020 to clarify the role being played by ADF International in relation to student protesters and to add a comment from ADF International.", "label": 0}, "text-443": {"text": "science editor finds evidence that oceans are cooling\nDr David Whitehouse, Science Editor of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, discusses the recent history of ocean temperatures, including the Tasman Sea between New Zealand and Australia.", "label": 1}, "text-444": {"text": "Red-state Utah embraces plan to tackle climate crisis in surprising shift\nIn a move to protect its ski slopes and growing economy, Utah \u2013 one of the reddest states in the nation \u2013 has just created a long-term plan to address the climate crisis.\nAnd in a surprising turnaround, some of the state\u2019s conservative leaders are welcoming it.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t think about Utah\u2019s long-term future, who will?\u201d Republican state house speaker Brad Wilson said at a recent focus group to discuss the proposals.\nAt the request of the Republican-dominated state legislature, a University of Utah economic thinktank produced the plan to reduce emissions affecting both the local air quality and the global climate.\nProject lead Thomas Holst, an energy analyst, never expected to be at the helm of an effort like this. A few years ago, the Utah legislature passed a resolution urging the EPA to \u201ccease its carbon dioxide reduction policies, programs, and regulations until climate data and global warming science are substantiated\u201d.\nBut now the perspectives of some state lawmakers \u2013 and of Holst, who spent most of his career in the oil and gas industry \u2013 have shifted.\n\u201cThe economist Adam Smith talked about an invisible hand that guides the economy, and in this particular case, the cost of renewable energy, whether it\u2019s wind or solar, has gone down so rapidly and made itself so market efficient versus fossil fuels, that there is a change, and the change can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Holst said. \u201cSo now is the opportunity for a state like Utah which is rich in both renewables as well as fossil fuels to embrace that change and get out ahead of it.\u201d\nOther red states and municipalities are slowly starting to address global heating. After banning the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from state environmental agencies, Florida now has a chief resilience officer tasked with preparing for sea level rise. After a year of disastrous flooding, Nebraska lawmakers advanced a bill to develop a climate change plan for a full legislative debate. \nUtah prides itself on being business friendly \u2013 and it has a rapidly growing tech sector concerned about environmental issues, as well as booming tourist economy that revolves around the ski industry and public lands.\nThe Utah plan, known as the Utah Roadmap, began, like a number of recent environmental initiatives, with young people clamoring for action. High school students drafted a resolution that recognized the impacts of the climate crisis and encouraged emissions reductions, and persuaded two Republican lawmakers to sponsor it. Environmental advocates say it was the first measure of its kind to pass in a red state. The legislature followed up with state money for experts to provide policy recommendations.\nAnother factor that has primed Utah leaders to address the climate crisis is the state\u2019s unique air quality issues. The majority of the population lives in mountain valleys where in winter, temperature inversions can trap air pollutants, often reaching levels that impact health, particularly among children and the elderly.\n\u201cIt cuts across political lines. [Clean air] is not a partisan issue in our state,\u201d said Utah speaker Wilson. He said there is not the same kind of consensus on climate change in the legislature, but \u201cthere is absolutely overlap between air quality concerns we have and reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u201d.\nNatalie Gochnour, the head of the economic policy institute that drafted the Utah Roadmap, said its proponents managed to turn a hyper-partisan issue into a shared priority by emphasizing the local impacts of the climate crisis. Research suggests that framing policy around economic benefits and sustainability allows local leaders to respond to climate change without getting caught up in political divisions.\n\u201cThat tends to pull some of the politics out of it \u2013 not for everybody \u2013 but for many. I think enough to create momentum on Capitol Hill,\u201d Gochnour said.\nClean air concerns are also the reason officials are pushing Utah gas refineries to produce cleaner gasoline, and when the Trump administration announced plans to roll back clean car standards, Utah\u2019s bipartisan clean air caucus held a press conference urging Congress to resist the move.\nIt cuts across political lines. Clean air is not a partisan issue in our state\nHolst, the roadmap project lead, acknowledged that blue coastal states have taken the initiative on ameliorating climate change, but he sees potential for Utah. \u201cIs there an opportunity for a red state to take a leadership role? We believe that there is. And by composing a road map, by encouraging our legislative leaders to embrace this, we believe that there can be a change, and that Utah will be willing to take a leadership role,\u201d he said.\nUtah\u2019s per capita carbon emissions are higher than most states, in part because it\u2019s nearly twice as reliant on coal, but utilities serving Utah customers plan to close many of their coal power plants by 2030, converting to wind, solar, natural gas, and possibly hydrogen. Republican state lawmaker Melissa Garff Ballard has an ambitious plan to make Utah a source of hydrogen power serving the western US.\nAmong the Utah Roadmap\u2019s top priorities is to reduce CO2 emissions by half over the next decade \u2013 a challenge for a state with a growing population. The plan suggests focusing on energy-efficient buildings and clean transportation options. It recommends expanding Utah\u2019s network of charging stations, incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicles, and involving auto dealers in strategies to increase the zero-emissions vehicle supply.\nBusiness leaders have told Holst they are drafting a document that would pledge to move forward with the Utah Roadmap\u2019s recommendations.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m interested in is a viable future for the state of Utah,\u201d Republican state representative Stephen Handy said. \u201cThere are still a number of Utah legislators who don\u2019t want to look at the science that\u2019s very obvious on climate change, but we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 19 February 2020 to clarify Brad Wilson\u2019s comments on clean air.", "label": 0}, "text-445": {"text": "'I want this book to be politically useful\u2019: the explosive memoir exposing Silicon Valley\nIn a leafy cafe courtyard in San Francisco, Anna Wiener is cradling a cup of tea while eavesdropping on the next table. \u201cThere\u2019s a man wearing shiny pants, holding forth on artificial intelligence and \u2018the Chinese hegemon\u2019,\u201d she says, eyes glimmering with amusement.\nIt will come as no surprise to readers of her debut, Uncanny Valley, that Wiener is as quick witted in person as she appears on the page. \u201cAll writing is a sort of performance,\u201d she says. In the book Wiener condenses five years of working at tech startups in Silicon Valley into a neat narrative about outsized male egos, dramatic wealth disparities and the psychological toll on young female employees.\nDespite its unsavoury and troubling contents \u2013 unregulated surveillance technology, ruthless bosses, casual sexual harassment \u2013 the book is a delight. Deftly drawn characters are granted pseudonyms and companies are unnamed; instead they are identified by cutting descriptions. Facebook is the \u201csocial network everyone hated\u201d and Edward Snowden is \u201cthe NSA whistleblower who was back in media\u201d. Microsoft is the \u201chighly litigious Seattle-based software conglomerate\u201d. Essentially, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that Google is an ad platform and that Facebook is a surveillance platform.\u201d\nI envied their sense of entitlement to the future. There were no crises in their vision \u2026 only opportunities.\nWiener interviewed former colleagues and friends, engaging in what she calls \u201ca dance around everyone else\u2019s NDA\u201d. She also scoured her iMessage chats and email archive for granular details, such as the humourless office flag that read \u201cIn Meritocracy We Trust\u201d. \u201cMy Gmail is an incredible corpus of mid-20s work anxiety,\u201d she sighs. \u201cAnd an archive of what in hindsight are very obvious ways to navigate work situations that were overly complex, because I didn\u2019t know how to be a person.\u201d\nThe book first took shape in 2015 as a lightly fictionalised essay for the Brooklyn-based literary magazine n+1. Wiener\u2019s piece went viral but the surge of attention came as a shock. \u201cI thought that no one in literary n+1 world would care about Silicon Valley startups, and that no one in Silicon Valley reads n+1.\u201d For years, she had documented the cultish work rituals and peculiar cultural norms of the industry, but it wasn\u2019t until Dayna Tortorici, editor of n+1, visited San Francisco that she considered synthesising those observations into a cohesive narrative. \u201cDayna has a theory that people in tech aren\u2019t used to being seen because everything is mediated,\u201d Wiener says. \u201cI wrote the piece to entertain her.\u201d\nAs an editor, Tortorici had noticed an unnerving pattern: when writing about their workplaces, female contributors were often threatened for violating NDAs, whereas rarely, if ever were NDAs used against male writers. (Despite the industry\u2019s fervent defences of freedom of speech, most tech companies also enforce strict policies that ensure former employees stay silent about work conditions, including sexual harassment allegations.)\nWhile she didn\u2019t face NDA-related constraints, Wiener\u2019s first drafts were fairly restrained. Tortorici encouraged her to reveal more about her former bosses without worrying about reprisals. By 2018, Wiener had left her job at the software development platform GitHub after a seven-way auction to expand the original n+1 essay into a book. (And in January 2018, Universal Pictures optioned film rights; the screenplay is now in its initial development stages and Wiener is executive producer.) \u201cI very deliberately wrote this book as non-fiction and memoir,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause if I wrote it as fiction, it could be mistaken as satire. And I don\u2019t know how politically useful satire about the tech industry is in 2019. I want this book to be politically useful.\u201d\nWiener, now 32, grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her mother is a writer and gun-control activist \u2013 co-founder of the nonprofit New Yorkers Against Gun Violence \u2013 and her father a former business journalist; she was exposed to feminist ideas and progressive politics at a young age. In person, Wiener is self-possessed. Apart from bitten fingernails and frank asides about therapy there are few signs of neuroses, although she says: \u201cI have very bad anxiety.\u201d Her worries around the book centre on her use of creative non-fiction techniques: the story is based on real events, but the specific timeline and characters are compressed for clarity and cohesion. She is concerned about whether people in the tech industry will understand the conventions of this approach \u2013 and about possible backlash from tech executives whose public images can directly affect their companies\u2019 stock value. \u201cI sometimes have these daytime nightmares about testifying in court about creative non-fiction, where I\u2019m like, \u2018I would like to summon Vivian Gornick to the stand to explain compression,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019d like to bring in John D\u2019Agata to discuss composite characters.\u2019\u201d\nJust as New York City is a core character in Ben Lerner\u2019s auto-fictitious 10:04 and various areas of California play leading roles in Joan Didion\u2019s seminal essay collection The White Album, both influential texts for Wiener, San Francisco and its immersive digital world are central characters in Uncanny Valley. The digital landscape is textured with what is referred to as \u201cGod mode\u201d \u2013 an employee\u2019s unbridled access to her company\u2019s database, from which she can intensively track users and glean their personal information. In the book, Wiener describes her workplace\u2019s blase, apolitical attitude to God mode: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of ourselves as participating in the surveillance economy. We certainly weren\u2019t thinking about our role in facilitating and normalising the creation of unregulated, privately held databases on human behaviour.\u201d She continues: \u201cUsers might not know they were being tracked, but that was between them and our customer companies.\u201d\nWhile writing, Wiener studiously avoided reading books about the tech industry, and instead focused on office novels and compact memoirs, including Renata Adler\u2019s groundbreaking novel Speedboat, which centred on a New York journalist in the 70s; and Sarah Manguso\u2019s The Guardians, a memoir about mourning the death of a friend who escaped from a psychiatric hospital and jumped in front of a train. \u201cI tried to reread Ellen Ullman\u2019s Close to the Machine a little bit stoned in a hot bath \u2013 an ostensibly relaxing situation \u2013 and almost had a panic attack. It\u2019s essentially a perfect memoir and sets the standard,\u201d she explains. (Ullman is an engineer who documented her experience developing software at the forefront of the male-dominated technology boom in the 90s.)\nFor a moment, Wiener is distracted by the cafe\u2019s playlist as Nirvana thunder over the speakers. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m 16 and burning incense in my bedroom and telling my mom I\u2019m a vegetarian,\u201d she deadpans.\nWe return to unpacking Silicon Valley\u2019s accountability problem and popular modes of aggrandisement. \u201cThe way that people spoke in San Francisco was so strange to me, like all of the acronyms, jargon and weird things that people do to the English language. To inspire us in a meeting, one CEO said, \u2018We\u2019re at war!\u2019 And like, \u2018Learnings.\u2019 Why? It\u2019s \u2018lesson\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI find the naming scheme of the last 15 years in tech companies to be very funny, these names are just obscene.\u201d She rattles off AppLovin and Verbling as two of her favourites. \u201cYou can practically throw a spitball and hit a badly named company.\u201d\nThroughout the memoir, there are moments when Wiener acquiesces to male characters\u2019 demands only to correct her course with a renewed sense of agency. In a memorable scene, she goes out to a Japanese bar with her mostly male co-workers to celebrate their boss\u2019s birthday, conceiving of herself as the \u201cbabysitter, fifth wheel, chaperone, little sister, ball and chain, and concubine\u201d. She explains: \u201cI was always trying to be someone\u2019s girlfriend, sister or mother.\u201d (Uncanny Valley takes place in the years leading up to the #MeToo movement; details about a sexual assault incident were withheld from the book to protect her former colleague\u2019s anonymity.)\nThe 2016 election result strikes at the end of the book with cataclysmic force, no doubt a reflection of the way the author herself experienced the event. \u201cThe major failure of the media in the years leading up to the election was to not take tech companies and their ambitions very seriously,\u201d Wiener says. \u201cThe media engaged with the industry on the industry\u2019s terms. It lapped up the mythology.\u201d\nIn reference to the founders of an ebook startup, Wiener\u2019s first tech job, she writes: \u201cI envied their sense of entitlement to the future. There were no crises in their vision \u2026 only opportunities.\u201d In California, this techno-optimist outlook is often associated with anti-union, libertarian politics. By contrast, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve always had a hard time picturing a future, which one could credit to having witnessed a major terrorist attack as a teenager.\u201d She pauses. \u201cIn my head I was like, don\u2019t mention 9/11.\u201d She continues: \u201cMy hope for the future is that we start to move slower and at a smaller scale.\u201d\nAt the end of Uncanny Valley, after the 2016 election, Wiener writes that she felt that the industry \u201cwas in for a reckoning, that it was the beginning of the end, that what [she] had experienced in San Francisco was the final stage of a prelapsarian era, the end of our generational gold rush, an unsustainable age of excess.\u201d A freewheeling culture of misinformation, offensive memes and trolling \u2013 unfettered by regulation or oversight \u2013 only proliferated. Wiener says: \u201cThe city and the industry, bound by the ecosystem, continued to cycle and churn.\u201d\nOf course, conflicting views of the future also reflect a greater schism in industry. Just as the publishing world shrinks, tech companies bloat with capital. \u201cIf we continue on the track that we\u2019re on, we\u2019re going to move into an era of even greater privatisation,\u201d Wiener says, shifting uncomfortably in her chair. \u201cThe future will be increasingly homogeneous, divisive and private.\u201d To illustrate this point she highlights public goods or services that are increasingly privatised, like for-profit coding boot camps, which are marketed as an investment or a substitute for a four-year university degree. \u201cThe tech industry is trying to provide solutions to crises that they didn\u2019t necessarily create, but that they are now exacerbating.\n\u201cEveryone deserves better. Especially employees and consumers. But I don\u2019t know that change is going to come from within the industry because the incentives of venture capital encourage speed and rapid growth, which inspire a certain thoughtlessness \u2013 or recklessness.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThere is currently very little accountability.\u201d \n\u2022 Uncanny Valley: A Memoir is published by HarperCollins (RRP \u00a316.99).

At the same time, it feels as if we\u2019ve walked into an old recurring dream. In a way, we have. We\u2019ve seen it before, on TV and in blockbusters. We knew roughly what it would be like, and somehow this makes the encounter not less strange, but more so.\nEvery day brings news of developments that, as recently as February, would have felt impossible \u2013 the work of years, not mere days. We refresh the news not because of a civic sense that following the news is important, but because so much may have happened since the last refresh. These developments are coming so fast that it\u2019s hard to remember just how radical they are.\nCast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be out of work. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history. In certain places, landlords will not be collecting rent, or banks collecting mortgage payments, and the homeless will be allowed to stay in hotels free of charge. Experiments will be underway in the direct government provision of basic income. Large swathes of the world will be collaborating \u2013 with various degrees of coercion and nudging \u2013 on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing?\nIt\u2019s not just the size and speed of what is happening that\u2019s dizzying. It\u2019s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global flu epidemic of 1918 helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.\nBut crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military\u2019s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is being slowed by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was resolved in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.\nBecause crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work \u2013 what we might call the field of \u201ccrisis studies\u201d \u2013 charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear.\nIn such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-empty flights for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been reports of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. Prisoners in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.\nBut disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it\u2019s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we\u2019re entering become clear. \nThe pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters \u2013 and especially pandemics \u2013 know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders \u2013 and assaulted, banished and killed \u201cundesirable\u201d community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of \u201cxenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\u201d: they range from taunts to outright assault.\n\u201cIn a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,\u201d says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote a book about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. \u201cIn a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies \u2013 test kits, masks, respirators \u2013 not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it\u2019s all one battle. But it\u2019s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.\u201d\nIn the US, President Trump has tried hard to brand the new coronavirus as inherently \u201cChinese\u201d, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have claimed or implied that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the conspiracy theory that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, recently announced: \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it\u2019s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn\u2019t used. \u201cIn the course of a few days,\u201d Zuboff says, \u201cthe concern shifted from \u2018How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights\u2019 to \u2018How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?\u2019\u201d\nFor governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones\u2019 built-in speakers broadcast scoldings from police. Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium are all using data \u2013 anonymised, for now \u2013 from major telecommunications companies to track people\u2019s movement. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individual\u2019s phone records. South Korea sends texts to the public identifying potentially infected individuals and sharing information about where they\u2019ve been.\nNot all surveillance is inherently malign, and new tech tools very well might end up playing a role in fighting the virus, but Zuboff worries that these emergency measures will become permanent, so enmeshed in daily life that we forget their original purpose. Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. \u201cPeople have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they\u2019re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,\u201d says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. \u201cOnce a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.\u201d\nIn the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the authority \u2013 in place for the next two years \u2013 to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed a request with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. \u201cThose of us who follow the police know how this goes,\u201d said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. \u201cThese powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time \u2013 and then very quickly they\u2019re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.\u201d\nIn a 2008 report on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency \u2013 resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 \u2013 for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: \u201cPeople, rather than the disease, become the enemy.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat \u2013 with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited \u2013 Covid-19 might open the door to political progress.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,\u201d said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today\u2019s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. \u201cIdeas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There\u2019s room for change that there wasn\u2019t beforehand. It\u2019s an opening.\u201d\nThe argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state does have \u2013 the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra recently wrote: \u201cIt has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.\u201d\nFor years, in mainstream politics the conventional line \u2013 on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing \u2013 has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are \u201cmarketplace\u201d solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like \u201cthe public good\u201d but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days \u2013 even going so far as to write cheques directly to citizens \u2013 and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.\nFrom this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus \u2013 and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.\nIn her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit used case studies of disasters \u2013 including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina \u2013 to argue that emergencies aren\u2019t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster \u2013 but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit\u2019s telling, \u201cofficial\u201d disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.\nSometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence \u2013 other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein\u2019s view, there is always Disaster 1 \u2013 the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump \u2013 and Disaster 2 \u2013 the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)\nUnlike Solnit\u2019s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn\u2019t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably \u2013 or \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.\nIn 2008, days after Barack Obama\u2019s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\u201d Today\u2019s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?\nFor anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they\u2019re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be \u201cin it together\u201d \u2013 as always, the poor are hit worse \u2013 but there is more truth to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.\nIn this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.\n\u201cMore people are in a position to connect the dots,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt has to do with people\u2019s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.\u201d\nThat screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming \u2013 that they know is already here \u2013 and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.\nAlthough Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter\u2019s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. \u201cWhat is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode \u2013 when they fundamentally accept that there\u2019s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it\u2019s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go \u2018back to normal\u2019, because things weren\u2019t normal.\u201d\nThe analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.\nBut it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke used pollution data from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online \u2013 stories of sweet-smelling breezes, expanded bike lanes and birdsong returning to neighbourhoods \u2013 in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.\nAlongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein\u2019s \u201cshock doctrine\u201d framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that, in recognition of the pandemic\u2019s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China\u2019s environmental ministry has started waiving inspections that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a public relations blitz on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too \u2013 only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.\nSalamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I\u2019m talking about people calling each other up and saying: \u2018How are you doing? Are you scared? I\u2019m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we\u2019re terrified about.\u201d Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unless we also do it for climate \u2026 \u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.\nWhat kind of actions would it take for the optimists\u2019 vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. \u201cThe left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.\u201d How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?\n\u201cThe political outcome of the epidemic,\u201d said Mike Davis, \u201cwill, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.\u201d One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. \u201cThe biggest risk for all of us,\u201d said Klein, \u201cis going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.\u201d\nDavis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn\u2019t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about \u201cSUPPORT THE NURSES\u2019 UNION\u201d or \u201cDEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE\u201d.\nSolnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn\u2019t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour\u2019s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak wave of strikes roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.\nWhat happens next might depend on the optimists\u2019 ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,\u201d wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. \u201cWe cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.\u201d \nThe world feels awfully strange right now, but not because \u2013 or not just because \u2013 it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it. It feels strange because the past few weeks have exposed the fact that the biggest things can always change, at any minute. This simple truth, both destabilising and liberating, is easy to forget. We\u2019re not watching a movie: we\u2019re writing one, together, until the end.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 31 March. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Mike Davis lives in Hawaii.

On the threshold of worldwide enactment of the Kyoto Protocol, the Russians are saying \u0093nyet,\u0094 and scientists around the world are busy ripping the rug out from under alarmist climate predictions.\n\nFirst the science. Climate alarmists advocating Kyoto have long built their case on the claim that recently observed warming is historically unusual, and is therefore likely to be caused by human action. But since nobody was taking the Earth\u0092s temperature a thousand years ago, the claim that humans are changing the climate rests on a relatively simplistic theory about how the climate works, and on comparisons of recent temperatures with those derived from \u0093proxy\u0094 indicators of past temperature, such as tree rings, and coral shell characteristics. The most alarmist \u0093reconstruction\u0094 of past temperatures was developed by a researcher named Michael Mann, and his 1998 temperature reconstruction (shaped something like a hockey stick laying flat with its blade in the air), which led the United Nations Climate Panel to claim \u0093that the 1990s has been the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year of the millennium\u0094 for the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nBut skeptical scientists have doubted this representation of past climate for decades. Many scientists studying ancient climates found evidence that past ages had climate shifts to temperatures considerably warmer than today, shifts that happened more quickly than recently observed climate change. The most recent warm period scientists have identified is the Medieval Warm Period, which happened about 1000 years ago. The most recent cold snap scientists have identified is called the Little Ice Age, which happened from about 1300 to 1900 AD. To support the hockey stick against challengers, alarmists have worked hard to classify both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age as \u0093local phenomena,\u0094 and thus, not meaningful indicators of global climate.\n\nBut two recent studies have badly damaged the hockey stick. The first study, by Harvard Astrophysicist Sallie Baliunas, and her colleague Willie Soon, reviewed more than 200 climate studies, and confirms the that both the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were global, not regional, phenomena. As Baliunas explains, \u0093For a long time, researchers have possessed anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of these climate extremes. For example, the Vikings established colonies in Greenland at the beginning of the second millennium that died out several hundred years later when the climate turned colder. And in England, vineyards had flourished during the medieval warmth. Now, we have an accumulation of objective data to back up these cultural indicators.\u0094\n\nThe most recent study to crack the hockey stick was, appropriately enough, by Canadian researchers Ross McKitrick and Steve McIntyre. The two Canadians obtained the very same data sets and methods ostensibly used by Mann in constructing the hockey stick, and ran an audit on the data and calculations. Their findings were shocking. The Mann dataset, they found, contained numerous errors in data handling. Critical data sets were truncated or extrapolated unreasonably; some of the data was obsolete, there were errors where temperature records were erroneously linked to the wrong geographical location, and there were errors in various calculation methods.\n\nMcKitrick and McIntyre fixed the errors, re-ran the calculations using Mann\u0092s own methods, and lo and behold, no more hockey stick. Instead, the repaired climate reconstruction looks a bit more like the side view of a pie plate, with high global temperatures seen around 1000 years ago, a dip into a cold spell till around 1900, and a return to warmer temperatures over the last 100 years.\n\nNow to the politics. For the Kyoto Protocol to actually come into force as a binding international treaty, it has to be signed by 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of global emissions in 1990. Canada\u0092s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol brought treaty supporters close enough to the target that only one more country was needed: Russia. But the great bear is focused on putting its economic house in order, and furthermore, has scientists who are far more skeptical about climate change than their colleagues in the West. So when Russian President Vladimir Putin, backed by prestigious scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, came out against the treaty at the recent World Climate Change Conference in Moscow, there was a collective groan of anguish among climate alarmists, who are now desperate to get the treaty into effect before still other studies in the wings continue to rip the underpinnings out of their alarmist scenarios.", "label": 1}, "text-448": {"text": "stop the climate stupidity - we're back where we were 1000 years ago\nAustralian climate analyst, David Archibald, explains in full detail at WentworthReport.com, how the global warming myth was conjured up in 1980, and why, and rebuts the false claims by warmist propagandists.

Peter Hennessy, who I like enough to suspect knows better, spoke for virtually the entire national media when he blamed Cameron and excused the sovereign. \u201cThese things have to be kept private,\u201d he thundered, while ignoring that there was nothing private about her intervention in the Scottish referendum.\nNo one asked why the monarch cannot intervene in politics, as Prince Charles has done for years. At the level of prime ministers, what would stop a Corbyn administration, say, telling the Queen to use her political clout \u2013 nothing improper or unconstitutional, just a raising of the eyebrow \u2013 to help it? If the Queen were to refuse, as she is likely to, because the head of a hereditary aristocracy is no more likely to support a radical left programme than Scottish independence, could Corbyn denounce her political bias?\nFrom the point of view of the monarch, the question is anything but hypothetical. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings understand that the old conventions of public life are there to be subverted. Blow away the dust and they crumble. It was convention that prime ministers resigned when they lost the confidence of the Commons. Johnson did not resign. He behaved as if he commanded a Commons majority and it had mandated him to shutter parliament for five weeks. Critics condemn Johnson\u2019s lies to the public and, presumably, to the Queen. I accept that the brass-necked absurdity of pretending he is not trying to avoid being held to account on Brexit is his greatest insult to the national intelligence to date.\nIf she agrees to suspend parliament twice it will be political. If she refuses it will be political\nMore important constitutionally are his double standards. He is behaving as if he is a strong prime minister when he is an enfeebled politician without a mandate or a majority.\nWhen a prime minister with a majority asks the Queen for a prorogation, it\u2019s a simple administrative matter. Parliament approves, so no one can object. Johnson has no majority. He is using prorogation to escape the democratic control of the majority MPs. He and Cummings are the most dangerous type of men I know: wimps who pose as tough guys, and lash out at everyone who exposes them.\nAnne Twomey, the leading authority on monarchical power in Commonwealth democracies, thinks the Queen had the right to say Johnson\u2019s request to close parliament was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d because it was \u201cdone for the purpose of avoiding a vote of no confidence or other action by parliament against the government\u2019s will\u201d. In other words, he was seeking to silence MPs and deny the fundamental duty of the legislature to scrutinise the executive.\nJohnson exploited the convention that the Queen does what the PM tells her and got his way. But another convention is that she stays out of politics and she has broken that. If she can break one convention, she can break another.\nI am not raising a hypothetical question. The issue could explode this week. When the supreme court judges asked what the government would do if it found suspending parliament was unlawful, Johnson\u2019s lawyers said: \u201cDepending on the court\u2019s reasoning, it would still either be open or not open to the prime minister to consider a further prorogation.\u201d Cummings has said that he would happily send Jacob Rees-Mogg off to tell the Queen to close parliament a second time.\nIf she agrees to suspend parliament twice it will be political. If she refuses it will be political. There\u2019s no escaping the politics. But because Britain does not have a written constitution, however, there is no politically legitimate way for her to react unless Her Majesty\u2019s judges protect Her Majesty by tying Johnson down.\nBrexit is showing that the monarchy is both too strong and too weak. It has formidable formal powers but convention dictates that it can be the puppet of a prime minister who lacks legitimacy.\nToday\u2019s impasse was bound to come one day. The trouble with conventions is that they can be twisted by any leader unscrupulous enough to insist that others must obey the conventions they break. Once the Brexit crisis is over, there will be an enormous job of work blocking up the loopholes that have allowed Johnson to abuse his power. Assuming, that is, we ever get out of the Brexit crisis and have the energy left to tackle any job of work again.\n\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist", "label": 0}, "text-453": {"text": "From the introduction:\n\"The question of whether climate change is produced by anthropogenic global warming (henceforth AGW) has triggered an increasingly contentious confrontation over the conduct of science, the question of what constitutes scientific certainty, and the connection between science and policymaking.

This is leaving more people grieving but with fewer outlets to express their feelings, the charity said.\n\u201cIn normal times we know that the ability to attend a funeral, a rite of passage for thousands of years in human civilisation, is an important part of the grieving process,\u201d said Matthew Reed, the chief executive of Marie Curie. \u201cIt closes the book on a person\u2019s life and is the chance to open a new chapter for the people that are left. Because people aren\u2019t able to properly express their grief it is creating a tsunami of loss. The consequences of not handling it well can last for decades.\u201d\nReed said the failure to address grief after the second world war had widespread consequences for a generation of Britons, and while the death toll from cononavirus will not match that left in 1945, the same problem must not be allowed to recur. He said the focus on the number of coronavirus dead, expressed in curves and graphs, tended to play down the emotional impact of the epidemic in the UK.\n\u201cBecause the numbers tend to grab headlines and form the national narrative it is easy to forget that behind these [figures] lie individual families,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen rites of passage don\u2019t happen you get ragged ends,\u201d he said, adding these can cause lower self-esteem, mental health problems and it becomes \u201cmore difficult for people to realise their full potential in life\u201d, at a cost to the economy.\nReed said Marie Curie wanted to build a broad coalition among different charities and faith groups to create an inclusive day of remembrance and was planning to lobby the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, to give it government support.

As this parish has previously covered, the Mexican top flight is no backwater. It has been recently graced by the mercurial Ravel Morrison, the deadly Keisuke Honda and the, erm, Vincent Janssen.\nPerhaps the best-known Liga MX import is French international Andre-Pierre Gignac, who signed for the wonderfully-named Tigres five years ago and is still banging in goals aged 34.\nHowever, to view Liga MX as just a home for forgotten names of football is to do it a disservice.

Herrera\u2019s celebrations in the rain are also quite something.\nSpare a thought for Cruz Azul. That defeat in 2013 prolonged a wait for a league crown that is still ongoing and stretches back to 1997. La Maquina\u2019s last title was secured in almost equally dramatic and certainly more violent circumstances than their aforementioned loss. In extra time of the league final\u2019s second leg, with Cruz Azul searching for a win after the tie finished 1-1 on aggregate, Le\u00f3n\u2019s Argentine keeper \u00c1ngel Comizzo chose to reinforce a well-worn clich\u00e9.\nThe Turkish Super Lig is still carrying on, albeit without fans.

I\u2019m going to focus in on one particular question raised by the Pope: Is capitalism fundamentally incompatible with environmental protection? The Pope certainly seems to think so. As he writes (@190):\n\nHere too, it should always be kept in mind that environmental protection cannot be assured solely on the basis of financial calculations of costs and benefits. The environment is one of those goods that cannot be adequately safeguarded or promoted by market forces\u2026.Where profits alone count, there can be no thinking about the rhythms of nature, its phases of decay and regeneration, or the complexity of ecosystems which may be gravely upset by human intervention.\nThere are two flaws here. First, the Pope is arguing against a straw man by implying that the alternative to his vision is a world without environmental regulation, \u201cwhere profits alone count.\u201d Every country in the world has environmental regulations in place, especially the advanced western market economies. Second, it is precisely in the countries where markets are relatively free, and where private enterprise is allowed to pursue profits, that we have seen the greatest gains in environmental quality over the past half century. The best examples of this are two decidedly capitalist countries, Canada and the United States.\n\nOn almost all measures, Canadians currently experience significantly better air quality than at any other time since continuous monitoring of air quality began in the 1970s. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, for instance, have decreased sharply in the vast majority of locations in Canada over the past 30 years. The decrease is especially apparent in our major urban centres. Concentrations of carbon monoxide, a potent toxic emission, have decreased everywhere in Canada, and since the mid-1990s there have been no exceedances of the strictest provincial air quality objective at any of the 156 monitoring locations across the country.\n\nConcentrations of two of the air pollutants of greatest concern\u2014ground-level ozone and ultrafine particulate matter\u2014have generally decreased across Canada since 2000. Air quality in Canada has improved and is improving.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not simply air quality that has improved. As previous reports have documented, water quality in Canada is generally quite good, and forests are no longer harvested beyond levels that are considered environmentally protective. More and more waste water is subject to high levels of treatment before being released to the environment, more solid waste is being diverted to recycling, soil quality has improved, and the size of protected areas has increased over recent decades.\n\nThe United States has seen similar (if not greater) improvements in environmental protection. A 2005 report published by the U.S. Department of State summarized 30 years of environmental progress thus: \u201cDuring this time, the U.S. economy grew by 187 per cent, population grew by 39 percent, and energy consumption increased by 47 per cent, yet air pollution decreased by 48 percent. In 2002, 94 per cent of Americans were served by community water systems that met all health-based standards, up from 79 per cent of the population in 1993.\u201d And improvements continue. As of 2013, according to the EPA, ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide decreased by 84 per cent of their 1980 levels; ozone had fallen by 33 per cent; ambient lead by 92 per cent, and sulfur dioxide by 81 per cent over the same time span.\n\nWhile Canada and the U.S. still face environmental challenges, their histories of development under democratic capitalism is one of broad-based environmental improvement coinciding with increasing income and wealth. It may not have occurred to the Pope that these two things can happen together, but had he checked the numbers he would have seen that his assumptions to the contrary are simply wrong.\n\nIn fact, if he really wants the people of the Earth to breathe clean air, drink clean water, protect critical ecosystems, and protect endangered species he could have given them much better advice, including advocating for ever-greater levels of democracy and economic freedom.", "label": 1}, "text-457": {"text": "How does the Matildas' pay deal stack up against the rest?\nLast week\u2019s announcement of the new Matildas pay deal was a landmark for football in Australia. The new collective bargaining agreement has base wages built in that provide pay parity with the team\u2019s male counterparts, the Socceroos, in many areas. With women\u2019s sport across Australia reaching greater heights than ever before, it is worth comparing how this deal stacks up against some other women\u2019s sports.\nThe new deal has guaranteed the Matildas a tiered payment system with minimum wages set at $40,000 and going up to $83,000 for top tier players \u2013 in line with what the Socceroos players will receive. Both teams will also have access to 24% of national team-generated revenue, which rises by 1% each year to 2023; 5% of this will be put back into youth and development programs. Both teams will also receive 40% of the prize money paid to Football Federation Australia for World Cup performances. Currently this is where the major disparity sits, as this money is set by Fifa and more money is provided for men\u2019s teams than women\u2019s; for example, the Socceroos received an $8m bonus for exiting the World Cup in the group stages, while the Matildas received $1m after progressing to the knockout stage.\nThe other major disparities will come from domestic league salaries and sponsorship. While the new deal has set W-League salaries at the same minimum hourly rate as the A-League, the contracted hours for the women\u2019s teams are much shorter, meaning the minimum wage for the W-League is $16,344 while the A-League sits at $64,100. Sam Kerr will net over $1m this year thanks to sponsorship and her new contract with Chelsea, but most Matildas will not be earning equally with their Socceroos counterparts, due to fewer sponsorship opportunities and fewer domestic league opportunities.\nThe Matildas\u2019 high-performance environment will also be improved to bring it in line with the Socceroos, which will include guaranteed business class flights for international travel, improved coaching structures, better operations support and access to wellbeing, education and transition services. The new pregnancy policy provides support for athletes during pregnancy and assistance to returning to the national team after childbirth.\nCricket Australia has sat at the forefront of equality between their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams for some time now. Their revenue-sharing model was the result of a tricky negotiation and currently sits at 29% for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. The minimum international wage for an Australian women\u2019s cricketer currently sits at approximately $75,000, increasing each year up to $87,609 by the end of the deal in 2022.\nWhile this is the highest international minimum wage among women\u2019s team sports in Australia, the men\u2019s cricket team\u2019s annual salaries start from $295,000. Men are also bolstered by their ability to play in cricket\u2019s richest league, the Indian Premier League, while Australia\u2019s women play mostly at home in their domestic competitions, with wages starting from around $26,000. With the introduction of The Hundred in England, there are now further opportunities internationally. Meg Lanning, Alyssa Healy and Sophie Molineux have all been picked up as marquee players in the draft.\nCricket\u2019s newly announced maternity and pregnancy provisions are second to none in Australian sport, with players given 12 months paid maternity leave and a guaranteed contract extension the following season, as well as travel support for children up to four years old and a carer.\nWith no equivalent men\u2019s team to draw comparisons with, women have always been at the top of the pecking order for netball. When considering the landscape of inequality in Australian sport as a whole, the focus on women for netball is essential.\nWhile Australia\u2019s netballers aren\u2019t the highest earners on the international stage, with the Diamonds each pulling in approximately $30,000 if they take part in all international games in a season, they are part of Australia\u2019s highest-paying domestic competition for women. The minimum wage in Suncorp Super Netball is $30,000 and the average player earns around $67,000. Sponsorship opportunities also allow for greater earning capacity and selected players act as ambassadors for national league and Diamonds\u2019 sponsors. Diamonds players also receive small bonus payments for gold medals at the Netball World Cup or Commonwealth Games.\nNetball also led the charge in establishing a pregnancy and maternity leave policy, with players entitled to 12 months\u2019 paid maternity leave for players in contract and travel support for a child up to 12 months and a carer. Netballers also receive $1,635 per year in private health insurance and income protection for up to two years in the case of injury and pregnancy. The high-performance environment is at the leading edge for women\u2019s team sports with wellbeing, education, nutrition, strength and conditioning and performance analysis all built into the programs.\nA relative new kid on the block, the AFLW has just completed its own negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. The new deal sees the minimum wage increase to $16,623 for Tier 4 players through to $29,856 for a Tier 1 player. However it pales in comparison with their male counterparts \u2013 a first-year rookie in the AFL has a minimum wage of $71,500.\nWith international matches not on the agenda, the earning capacity is limited to the short season in late summer and early autumn each year. While there are arguments that this short season is the reason for the significantly smaller salaries, players have continually pushed for longer seasons. The regular season will increase to 10 matches by 2022, with minimum wage increasing to $20,239 in that final year of the agreement.\nThe AFLW\u2019s maternity and pregnancy policy allows for travel support for an infant and carer up to 12 months, or longer if a child is still breastfeeding, with the current contract to be paid in full during pregnancy.\nAustralia\u2019s women\u2019s rugby sevens team made history in Rio, winning the first Olympic gold medal in the sport. They later made history when Rugby Australia made them full-time athletes, setting their minimum wage at $44,500 \u2013 equal to their male counterparts. Players are also entitled to 29% of national team generated revenue.\nHowever in the longer version of the game, Super W players are covered for travel costs only, with no payment on the table. Wallaroos players receive a $1,000 match payment for each game they are named in the 23-player squad, as well as a $500 training payment. Super Rugby players, on the other hand, are guaranteed a minimum wage of $44,500 with the average earnings reported at around $218,000. Wallabies players receive between $10,000 and $12,000 per match and are entitled to bonus payments for reaching the final of a Rugby World Cup.\nThe recently established competition is still a small player compared to most other women\u2019s sports. The contracting is more complicated, with 19 players granted elite contracts across the competition. These players are entitled to a significant share of the $750,000 pool for player wages. Players outside this group would likely earn approximately $8,500 per season. In comparison, the minimum wage for an NRL player in a club\u2019s top 30 in 2020 is $110,000.\nThe recent World Cup Nines was a step towards equality, with all players at the tournament \u2013 male and female \u2013 taking home equal payments of $2,000. Jillaroos players receive a $3,000 match payment for each Test and took home a $4,000 bonus for winning the 2017 World Cup. The Kangaroos, meanwhile, take home a $20,000 match fee for each Test and received a $20,000 bonus for winning the World Cup in the same year.", "label": 0}, "text-458": {"text": "No Mud on My Barnacles\nI lived for three years, from 2009 to 2012, in a delightful house just up from Lammermoor Beach with a view across to Great Keppel Island.   Lammermoor Beach is part of the Mackay/Capricorn Management Area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.\nLike many of the beaches along north eastern Australia, Lammermoor is aptly described as a \u2018low-energy shoreline\u2019.  This is because it is sheltered from the Pacific Ocean by the middle and outer reef.\nUnlike southern Australian surf beaches, the sand is much grittier, and browner, because the sediment washed down from the Fitzroy river (just to the south) is not washed out to sea.  Rather this sediment, which is estimated to accumulate at a rate of nearly 5 million tonnes each year from the Fitzroy River alone, is trapped within the inner reef \u2013 a region often referred to as the reef lagoon.\nThe southern end of Lammermoor beach is especially muddy.  This is where the mangroves grow on the mudflats, that are interspersed with rocky shoals exposed at low tide.\nLate in the afternoon, and especially at low tide, I could spend hours each day amongst the rock pools doing little more than inspecting the barnacles and watching the sun set to the west.\nI remember once turning over a rock, which disturbed a small, metallic green Sowrie crab.  It jumped clear of the pool of water, skidded across an oval of mud\u2026 straight into the beak of a Spur-winged plover.  That afternoon, after gobbling the crab, the plover raised its head, looked into my eyes and called out kerr-kick-ki-ki-ki.\nI do like these red-legged, yellow-faced shorebirds. They definitely preferred the muddier parts of Lammermoor beach.  I often watched them strut about late in the afternoon, then suddenly stop \u2013 freeze, immobilized, as though paralysed \u2013 always in the same position with a front-leg bent, head-down, eyes focused on the mud, which often shimmers in the late afternoon sun.\nThen just as suddenly as it became immobile, the bird would move again: specifically dip its beak into the goo, and pulls out a large worm.\nThe worms were always gobbled.  After several worms the plovers would make that sound again, kerr-kick-ki-ki-ki.\nThe mud is always there, at the southern end of Lammermoor.  But when the tide is in, and conditions are calm, you can\u2019t see it.  In fact, the water at Lammermoor Beach is often crystal clear, and from our house looks emerald green.  That is when the breeze is blowing gently.\nWhen the wind freshened, and especially when the wind moves more to the north east, and a swell picks-up \u2013 conditions sometimes associated with a low-pressure system \u2013 then the waters of Lammermoor Beach become muddy in appearance.  The change can be dramatic from one day to the next depending on the strength of the wind and the height of the swell.\nThis is all consistent with what the marine geophysics have written about the Great Barrier Reef coastline, which includes Lammermoor Beach. Their peer-reviewed technical papers explain in great detail how this \u2018bottom sediment\u2019 is resuspended by \u2018wave processes\u2019. They also explain that the sediment has been deposited over thousands of years.  The technical papers clearly explain that even if the \u2018rate of terrigenous sediment supply\u2019 has increased over the last 200 years due to human impacts on the catchments, there is already a lot of mud there.  In fact, these same technical papers explain that it is not \u2018the supply of sediment\u2019, which determines the muddiness of the reef lagoon.\nYet integral to the last twenty years of Great Barrier Reef activism \u2013 especially immediately following the launch of the \u2018Save the Great Barrier Reef\u2019 campaign by WWF in June 2001 \u2013 is the false notion that before European settlement the waters of the reef lagoon were always crystal clear.", "label": 1}, "text-459": {"text": "Wallabies emerge from challenging year with stronger connection to fans\nThe Wallabies have emerged from a challenging year both on and off the field with a significantly stronger connection to their fanbase, according to new research, while the Matildas remain Australia\u2019s most relatable national sports team.\nRugby Australia\u2019s strong stance on Israel Folau, whose contract was terminated in the wake of his anti-gay social media posts earlier this year, contributed to a significant improvement in the men\u2019s side\u2019s BenchMark score \u2013 a ranking devised to gauge the respect, enjoyment, trust, pride and bond held by those familiar with Australian sports teams.\nIn the attribute \u201ctaking an authentic stand on important issues\u201d, the Wallabies rose from 35th out of 62 teams to second in the latest survey conducted by True North Research.

On an individual level, captain Kerr scored highly and continues to be a major force driving connection to the team.\n\u201cThe Matildas\u2019 heartbreaking early exit at the World Cup hasn\u2019t made Australians any less committed to backing them,\u201d the True North Research director, Georgie Maynard, said. \u201cWe all shared their disappointment, but we also buy into their resolve to come back stronger.

In 1990 three Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets were expelled from the party after distributing a fake Labour leaflet alleging Labour would rehouse homeless Bangladeshis. In 2004, the agent in a byelection campaign, chaired by Tom Watson, emailed the candidate, Phil Woolas, and his campaign manager: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the white vote angry he\u2019s gone.\u201d When a court ruled that Woolas had breached election law by making false statements he received messages of support from both Gordon Brown and Cherie Blair.

A single black MP, Diane Abbott, receives half of all the online abuse sent to female MPs.\nRacism is not new to British politics. How could it be? As a nation built, in no small part, on slavery and colonialism, it has long infected our culture and institutions. And since politics emerges from that culture, is embedded in those institutions and involves distributing resources and power, it could never be immune. It is not just a matter of individuals with bad ideas, but a system of oppression that does bad things. All parties navigate it \u2013 you can\u2019t be on the ballot and not be in society.\nFor those who imagined that electoral politics offered a clear moral choice between parties untainted by racism, the last week would come as a particular shock. It certainly seemed to throw ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, in his response to the chief rabbi\u2019s statement that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism made him unfit for office. \u201cI am not making any kind of political statement here,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhat I am saying is our democracy has traditionally been a beacon of tolerance and understanding.\u201d Peston argues not only from a position of absolute ignorance but relative privilege.\nIt\u2019s difficult to see what meaningful conversation you can have about racism in British politics that does not involve the Windrush scandal\nThis is, of course, a very political statement from him. The fact that a political editor believes it is not is itself revealing. It seeks to take racism out of the realm of politics and into the domain of decency and fair play. Looking beyond politics to the coarse discourse below, he sets himself above it all and bigotry beneath us all.\nRacism doesn\u2019t work like that. It is not a metaphor \u2013 a symbol for incompetence, boorishness, impoliteness or stupidity. Nor is it a state of mind \u2013 a deficiency of the soul, heart, intellect, emotion or spirit. Racism is a systemic form of discrimination, with a centuries-old legacy, that shapes lived experience today. As such, it cannot be weaponised because it is already a weapon. As well as denying people employment, housing, education, equality, human rights, safety and opportunity, it can literally kill.\nRacism can, however, be deployed. It may galvanise, distract, deflect, distort, scapegoat and marginalise. It is an incredibly effective tool for dividing people and giving a sense of superiority to those to whom you have nothing material to offer.\nThe fact that it has blighted both parties does not mean they are equally as bad. Labour has, historically, been most likely to identify with movements that opposed racism \u2013 even if it has not always lived up to its promise \u2013 and to pass laws that supported equality. That is what makes the moment so distressing. When it comes to combating prejudice, people expect more from Labour; they expect nothing from Conservatives.\nNor does it mean that nothing can be done about it. The racism that exists in politics can only be eradicated through politics. At any given moment there are potential allies and opportunities to force institutions to meet their historic and stated ends. Trade unions were once the principal obstacle to non-white people being hired in some sectors in this country. Minorities did not abandon unions. They faced them down, fought them from the inside and turned many of them into effective bulwarks against racism. The issue is whether the organisation in question is fit for purpose.\nThe aim here is not to change the subject from antisemitism and Labour, but to broaden our understanding of it and, in so doing, deepen our capacity to resist it. It is, of course, possible to discuss antisemitism in Labour on its own terms. It is not necessary to deflect attention from it, minimise it, deny it or debate it. The presence of an element of the left that is susceptible to antisemitic conspiracy theories, and anxiety among Jews that those views are being tolerated and even encouraged, are both real.\nIt should also be possible to discuss it in relation to antisemitism elsewhere and to racism of other forms. Indeed, it is important to do so lest it is rendered an abstraction \u2013 examined as an isolated and particularised case of prejudice in the polity that afflicts one party and one minority, rather than a longstanding challenge to a part of our politics and culture that affects many minorities and all parties.\nTo talk about Islamophobia in this context is not \u201cwhataboutery\u201d. Half of all religious hate crimes in England and Wales are directed against Muslims, the religious group most disproportionately underrepresented in parliament and overrepresented among the poor. The Tory party\u2019s record on Muslims is appalling and it has no intention of addressing it specifically. It\u2019s difficult to see what meaningful conversation you can have about racism in British politics that does not involve the Windrush scandal, which saw British citizens forced out of jobs, denied housing and health care, deported, or threatened with deportation by a knowingly callous government. The only way in which issues like this become irrelevant is if you seriously think that a \u201cbeacon of tolerance and understanding\u201d has only now been extinguished.\nIt\u2019s an election. We have to make a choice. If \u201cthe soul of our nation\u201d really is at stake then these too are factors in that choice.\nIt is possible to keep more than one idea in your head at the same time. Indeed, it is necessary because those who would seek to divide us would love us to remain in ethnic silos, arguing about who has it worse \u2013 rather than uniting to make it better for everyone.\n\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist", "label": 0}, "text-461": {"text": "A year on, Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempt at regime change in Venezuela has stalled\nA year ago, on 23 January 2019, Juan Guaid\u00f3, chairman of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled national assembly, proclaimed himself president of the country and vowed to remove Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s pretender government was swiftly recognised by the Trump administration, as well as by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Brazil, and eventually some 50 countries in total. As street protests flared in Caracas, it seemed to many outside Venezuela that Maduro\u2019s days in office were numbered \u2013 and with them those of Chavismo, the radical left-populist movement that first surged to power in 1998 under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Yet, one year on, Maduro remains firmly ensconced in the presidential Miraflores Palace. And not only has the US-backed attempt at regime change failed to dislodge him, but it is now Guaid\u00f3\u2019s position at the head of the Venezuelan opposition that is looking shaky.\nThe fact of US backing for Guaid\u00f3\u2019s coup attempt was itself a major factor in rallying support for Maduro\nWhy did predictions of Maduro\u2019s imminent departure prove so ill-founded? The mismatch was partly the product of wishful thinking on the part of international establishment opinion. There has been a through-the-looking-glass aspect to much coverage of Venezuela over the past year, as if the reality were simply whatever the opposition said it was, rather than a political struggle it was the media\u2019s job to analyse and explain. But it is also clear that the US-sponsored drive towards regime change in Venezuela was premised on a series of miscalculations.\nIt was based, firstly, on an overestimation of the popular appeal of the Venezuelan opposition. A fringe politician before being elevated to the chairmanship of the national assembly, Guaid\u00f3 was always something of an ersatz figurehead, better at cultivating a following on Twitter than among ordinary Venezuelans. The confrontational strategy advocated by Guaid\u00f3 and his political mentor, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, was in part designed precisely to compensate for their lack of a broad support base, ratcheting up the pressure so the situation more closely matched the fever pitch of their anti-Chavista rhetoric.\nAfter failing to topple Maduro last January as planned, other debacles followed, notably an abortive army putsch on 30 April. This effort was very clearly concerted with US officials, including John Bolton, then national security adviser, who lamented that senior Venezuelan officials who were supposed to have changed sides had not done so. This pointed to another major miscalculation: the opposition had clearly exaggerated the degree of discontent with Maduro within the army, and officials in Washington either didn\u2019t know better or didn\u2019t care to question this misleading view.\nBut perhaps the biggest miscalculation of all, both by the Venezuelan opposition and the Trump administration, was to underestimate the resilience of Chavismo. Amid a desperate economic situation, and with a population suffering from unemployment, hunger and police repression, Maduro\u2019s popularity had plummeted, his support dwindling even in loyal constituencies. Yet discontent with Maduro was one thing; getting behind the Venezuelan opposition quite another. The fact of US backing for Guaid\u00f3\u2019s coup attempt was itself a major factor in rallying support for Maduro: Venezuelans have good reasons to hesitate before opting for a government glued together in Miami and Washington.\nOnce the initial drive for regime change fizzled out, the Venezuelan opposition camp also ran into other problems. Last June two of Guaid\u00f3\u2019s aides were mired in a corruption scandal, and more sleaze came to the surface in December over ties between nine Venezuelan opposition members and a Colombian businessman who was facing US sanctions. Another dent to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s image came in September when photographs surfaced of him alongside members of one of Colombia\u2019s rightwing paramilitary groups.\nBut the most damaging blow came on 5 January 2020, when the national assembly voted to replace Guaid\u00f3 as chair with a rival oppositionist, Luis Parra. This deprived Guaid\u00f3 of his already slender constitutional claim to the de facto presidency. Accounts of what happened next are highly contested: Guaid\u00f3 claims he was barred from entering the national assembly, and was filmed climbing the fence that surrounds the building; other opposition deputies, however, reportedly entered freely, and many of them voted for Parra. Later that day, Guaid\u00f3 held a parallel vote in the offices of an opposition newspaper, El Nacional, that reinstated him as national assembly chair. A week later, on 13 January, the US made its feelings clear by imposing sanctions on several opposition deputies who had voted for Parra, as well as on Parra himself.\nBehind these manoeuvres lies a highly significant division within the opposition, between those still committed to regime change at all costs and those willing to negotiate with Maduro to find some kind of political solution to Venezuela\u2019s crisis. Guaid\u00f3 represents the former group, but with the regime-change strategy stalled, the initiative last year began to shift to the latter camp.\nIn May 2019 and again in July, talks brokered by Norway were held between representatives of Maduro and the opposition. It was partly to break the momentum of these talks that the Trump administration announced a new and even more punitive round of sanctions last August. Aimed at tightening the screws on the Maduro government, they amount, like all sanctions, to collective punishment for the entire population, and have undoubtedly made an already dire situation much worse.\nThe sanctions are also unlikely to tilt the situation in the opposition\u2019s favour \u2013 as the US should have learned from 60 years of failed sanctions on Cuba. On the contrary, Maduro has been boosted by the mere fact of surviving in the face of such pressure. Parts of the opposition seem aware of this and have continued to negotiate with the government, with one eye on parliamentary elections due to be held by the end of 2020. Guaid\u00f3 still has the backing of the US and more than 50 other governments, including Brazil and Colombia, both major regional players. On the anniversary of his previous attempt, he is now trying to reinvigorate his push for regime change, having crossed over to Colombia to meet the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on 20 January. But there is little reason to think it will work any better this time.\nWhat does the situation in Venezuela tell us about the outlook for Latin America as a whole? Coming hot on the heels of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s election victory in Brazil in 2018, and of successes earlier that year for the right in Colombia and Chile, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempted coup seemed set to confirm a decisive swing to the right in the region. Yet Maduro\u2019s surprising endurance has bucked that trend, and while the November 2019 coup against Evo Morales in Bolivia reaffirmed the rightward shift, there have also been countervailing tendencies: Bolsonaro\u2019s slumping approval ratings, President Mauricio Macri\u2019s defeat in Argentina, Chile\u2019s continuing constitutional emergency, and mass anti-government protests in Colombia. There is no doubting that the right has been on the rise in Latin America. But its ascendancy is far from consolidated \u2013 and in this uncertain interregnum, much remains to be decided.\n\u2022 Tony Wood is an author who specialises in Latin America and Russia.

The farmer doesn\u2019t know when it is going to end, how much longer they will need to keep feeding their livestock, and how much longer they must wait until they can plant a crop.\nIf the Australian Bureau of Meteorology were useful, they would provide a reliable long-term rainfall forecast.  But they can\u2019t \u2013 the Bureau\u2019s three month seasonal, and longer rainfall forecasts, show no skill at forecasting.  It is one thing never to admit such incompetence, but they are also being dishonest about the real state of the climate.\nTheir most recent drought report is replete with colored maps suggesting that it is getting drier and drier \u2026 and rainfall trends are variously described as \u201cdownwards\u201d.  This is not so.\nA colored map doesn\u2019t necessarily provide any useful information about trend.  The maps in the Bureau\u2019s new drought report are simplistic depictions of points in time \u2013 relative to arbitrarily defined intervals in the past when it was wetter.  The maps are colored red, suggesting danger.  This is more propaganda from the behemoth.\nThe latest drought report focuses on eastern Australia, and particularly the Murray Darling Basin.\nIn reality the second half of the twentieth century was consistently wetter than the first half in this region of south eastern Australia. And while the last year has been desperately dry for farmers, it is not exceptionally dry considering the last 100 years of data \u2013 such statistics are obvious when annual rainfall is plotted from 1900 as a time series chart, as shown in Figure 2.\nThe bureau consistently refuses to provide the available data in this form.\nIn the most recent report, they bemoan specific seasons and time intervals as being more intense and/or more severe in rainfall deficit.  But if we are to cherry-pick, then why not consider how exceptionally wet it was in September 2016, as shown in Figure 3?\nOf course, the Bureau is run by \u201cScience Managers\u201d wedded to the theory of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming \u2013 so they only show intervals when it is drier than average consistent with their theory that Australia will experience below average rainfall because of elevated levels of carbon dioxide.  They show no curiosity when it comes to exceptionally wet periods in the recent record.\nThe managers at the Bureau are consistently dishonest in how they present the data, and the conclusions that they draw from it.\nIt is also fake news for the Bureau to claim that the drought is \u201cexacerbated by record high temperatures\u201d \u2013 and repeat that this last summer (2018-19) was Australia\u2019s hottest.  Considering the last 100 years, the hottest summer in the Murray-Darling Basin was probably the summer of 1938-39.   In rural Victoria, the summer of 1938-1939 was on average at least two degrees hotter than anything measured with equivalent equipment since, as shown in Figure 4.\nThe Bureau now measures temperatures as spot one-second readings from custom built electronic probes with unknown time constants*.   So, there is no way of knowing how hot it was last summer relative to the very hot summers of say 1938-39, when temperatures were measured with mercury thermometers.\nThe use of electronic probes without averaging will give higher temperatures for the same weather, as I explain in a letter to the Chief Scientist.\n_______________\n*Some explanation of time constants, and why averaging is so important is included in three blog posts, with links following \u2026\n1. Explanation with worked theoretical examples\nhttps://jennifermarohasy.com/2017/10/averaging-convention-not/\n\u201cThe sensors can respond much more quickly to changes in temperature, and on a hot day, the air is warmed by turbulent streams of ground-heated air that can fluctuate by more than 2 degrees on a scale of seconds. So, if the Bureau simply changed from mercury thermometers to electronic sensors, it could increase the daily range of temperatures, and potentially even generate record hot days simply because of the faster response time of the sensors.\nExcept to ensure consistency with measurements from mercury thermometers there is an international literature, and international standards, that specify how spot-readings from sensors need to be averaged \u2013 a literature and methodology being ignored by the Bureau.\nTo be clear, the UK Met office takes 60 x 1 second samples each minute from its sensors, and then averages these. In the US, they have decided this is too short a period, and the standard there is to average over a fixed 5-minute period. In Australia, however, the Bureau takes not five-minute averages, nor even one-minute averages, but just one second spot-readings.\nCheck temperatures at the \u2018latest observations\u2019 page at the Bureau\u2019s website and you would assume the value had been averaged over perhaps 10 minutes. But it is dangerous to assume anything when it comes to our Bureau. The values listed at the \u2018observations\u2019 page actually represent the last second of the last minute. The daily maximum (which you can find at a different page) is the highest one-second reading for the previous 24-hour period: a spot one-second reading in contravention of every international standard. There is absolutely no averaging.\nThen again, how many of you knew that the mean daily temperature as reported by meteorological offices around the world is not an average of temperatures recorded through the day and night but rather the highest and the lowest divided by two \u2013 as is the convention?\nThis convention developed because (surface) temperature measurements were originally instantaneous measurements from mercury thermometers recorded manually each morning (providing the minima) and afternoon (providing the maxima).\nSo, in the UK the daily maximum from a weather station with an electronic sensor will be the highest value derived from the averaging of 60 samples over that one-minute interval, while in Australia, the daily maximum will be the highest one-second spot reading.\n2. Explanation in context of record temperatures at Mildura, explaining how first probe recorded cooler than mercury thermometer\nhttps://jennifermarohasy.com/2017/11/law-unto-australian-bureau-meteorology/\n\u201cThe Bureau have since acknowledged that their method of recording temperatures from electronic sensors is not accredited, though they claim it nevertheless gives readings equivalent to mercury thermometers. Interestingly, your office emailed a journalist, backing them up \u2013 claiming that a single electronic sensor can \u201cmirror the behaviour of liquid in glass thermometers\u201d. This is nonsense, because mercury and alcohol thermometers have different time constants. This is one reason the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) insist on numerical averaging: alcohol thermometers (that measure temperature minima) have longer time constants than mercury thermometers (that measure temperature maxima).\n3.

Many of us fail to realize how essential that connection is.\nGiven that southern Florida \u2013 with its billions of dollars of vulnerable real estate on exposed coastline \u2013 is considered by many scientists as ground zero for climate change, I started my listening tour there. Floridians receive a constant stream of bad climate news. I was curious: does the state of the environment \u2013 specifically, the pending losses of biodiversity, tourism and property, and the prediction of category 6 hurricanes \u2013 keep people up at night? \nAfter a long morning of driving through the Everglades, I stopped at Joanie\u2019s Blue Crab Cafe, a vibrant red shack on the side of Highway 41 in Ochopee. \u201cSit anywhere you like, baby,\u201d Lisa, the waitress, said.\nI grabbed a bottle of Coors from the cooler, and sat on the sun-soaked back deck overlooking a stretch of water lined with sawgrass and frequented by alligators. Over a few hours I saw cypress swamps, mangrove forests, osprey, bald eagles, roseate spoonbills and sandhill cranes. Even though there has been a 90% loss of wading birds in the Everglades this century, there is still so much left to lose.\n\u201cYou\u2019re having the blackened grouper sandwich,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cSo good it will make you cry.\u201d\nLisa was right \u2013 the grouper was incredible. And crying wasn\u2019t out of the question. The government shutdown had given my trip a raw feeling. That morning signs were posted at the national park sites: \u201cEnter at your own risk.\u201d The Everglades \u2013 the largest subtropical wilderness left in the United States \u2013 is an environmental treasure imperiled by pollution, toxic algae blooms, disrupted water flow and politicians who favor big industries like sugar.\nClimate change denial and avoidance are prevalent here. The new governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, announced surprising plans for big environmental reforms earlier this month, without mentioning climate change (a term his predecessor, Rick Scott, also refused to use).\nMany people I spoke to in the Everglades didn\u2019t want to talk about climate change. They considered it too political.\nAfter I got home, I reached out to Erica Henry, a biologist who studies at-risk butterfly populations in the Florida Keys and Everglades, for her take. \u201cYou could be fatalistic about the fact that the news is bad, or that particular species seem doomed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could be paralyzed. But I\u2019ve picked off my little piece, the problem I can help solve.\u201d\nI drove north, through Florida\u2019s panhandle, witnessing miles of extensive tree damage from Hurricane Michael. I thought I\u2019d hear tales of increasing environmental anxiety over rising seas, and the misery of enduring hurricane seasons in the era of climate change. But in nearly all of my conversations, I encountered more resolve than anxiety.\nI booked a charter boat out of Ocean Springs, near Biloxi, to see Mississippi\u2019s barrier islands. My captain was Matthew Mayfield, a chef, restaurateur and fisherman with an infamous smoked tuna dip. As we pointed the skiff away from the Gulf Coast, he recalled how his wife\u2019s dresses were caught in the branches of the oak trees after Hurricane Katrina, just waving around.\nWe found a pelican skull and tail tracks of a small gator as we walked the white sand beaches of Horn Island, made famous by artist and conservationist Walter Anderson, who notoriously rode out Hurricane Betsy tethered to a tree. Mayfield told me about the clouds of monarchs that pass through in the fall. Generations from now, Horn Island may be gone.\nOn the way home, I worked up the courage to ask Matthew why he rebuilt his life on the coast. \u201cWhy do you stay?\u201d I asked. He said he needed time to think about it.\nIn the days that followed, he sent me reasons and pictures of the family property, colorful sunsets, local food, and a tame fox. \u201cPeople that live here realize that the reward greatly outweighs the risk and pain of a storm,\u201d he explained. \u201cNo one really cares how much you make or what you do for a living. Maybe we have a bond that storms intensify.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about the future?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI can\u2019t live my life like that,\u201d he said.\nA few days later, I stood across the street from the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, where 13 years ago Hurricane Katrina took down massive oak trees, ornamental fencing, a portion of roof and the marble hands of a statue of Jesus Christ.\nCammie Hill-Prewitt, who coordinates residencies for artists focused on the environment for Tulane University, agreed to talk to me about the spiritual tax of living on the coast in the era of climate change. She evacuated for Katrina, but stayed through Isaac, pregnant and with three house guests.\n\u201cI grind my teeth during hurricane season,\u201d Hill-Prewitt admitted. \u201cBut I have a 30-year mortgage. My partner owns restaurants. It\u2019s not easy to leave.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly zen about it,\u201d she clarified. \u201cIf you came back in September, when it\u2019s hot, and there are four tropical depressions looming in the Atlantic, you\u2019d get different responses. Incredible how short our memory is.\u201d\nWhile waiting for the annual Joan of Arc parade to start, we talked about a kid she knew who processed the trauma of Katrina through his Lego play for years, building houses then smashing them to pieces.\nThousands of people had lined the street, drinking, wearing sequined dresses and feathered hats. The drums started. A green paper mache dragon was hoisted into the air, followed by angels, then Joan of Arc on a well-trained horse.\nHill-Prewitt leaned over to me. \u201cThis is why we stay,\u201d she said.\nLater, I met Anna and Cam working at The Little Toy Shop near the bustling Cafe du Monde. They were in elementary school when Katrina hit. When I ask if they were anxious about climate change forecasts, Anna shrugged. \u201cMaybe for a year or two after Katrina,\u201d she said. Then she said something quietly profound. \u201cYou just learn not to get too attached to things.\u201d\nFrom New Orleans, I drove through Mississippi, from Natchez, to Piney-Woods, and finally Oxford, where I joined Heather McTeer Toney for coffee. She was the first African American mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, and a former Obama appointee, overseeing the south-east region of the Environmental Protection Agency. I wanted to hear about her experience with frontline communities, people living near levees and in flood zones.\n\u201cOur story of climate change and the south has always been about attachment to land,\u201d Heather explained. \u201cIt\u2019s generational. Cultural. This is our home and we\u2019re as intertwined as flesh and blood.\u201d\nHeather agreed with me that the south \u2013 particularly communities of color \u2013 is often unfairly painted as uniformly oblivious, and disinterested, when in fact the conversation is just taking place in a different language.\n\u201cWe talk about climate concerns daily, but express our fears through the changes we see in hunting, fishing and farming instead of carbon emissions and PM2 standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe understand it quite well and are fearful for the future of our homes and children.\u201d\nDuring my trip, I thought that I might observe more of a cultural tipping point, an urgency in places that need it most. But I found that many members of coastal communities have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather.\nAvoidance and denial are proven coping mechanisms. And, frankly, most people are just trying to work and get through the day, and express concern for the future differently, from off-record conversations to outright advocacy. But continuing to reckon with a science-based reality \u2013 as painful and worry-inducing as it might be \u2013 is an important step toward informing meaningful, individual action.\nHome is an emotional commitment. We\u2019re an adaptable species, but also habitual and sentimental; that\u2019s one reason we\u2019re stuck in denial. It\u2019s the reason change is going to hurt so much.", "label": 0}, "text-466": {"text": "French researchers to test nicotine patches on coronavirus patients\nFrench researchers are planning to test nicotine patches on coronavirus patients and frontline health workers after a study suggested smokers may be much less at risk of contracting the virus.\nThe study at a major Paris hospital suggests a substance in tobacco \u2013 possibly nicotine \u2013 may be stopping patients who smoke from catching Covid-19. Clinical trials of nicotine patches are awaiting the approval of the country\u2019s health authorities.\nHowever, the researchers insisted they were not encouraging the population to take up smoking, which carries other potentially fatal health risks and kills 50% of those who take it up. While nicotine may protect those from the virus, smokers who have caught it often develop more serious symptoms because of the toxic effect of tobacco smoke on the lungs, they say.\nThe team at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the virus, 350 of whom were hospitalised while the rest with less serious symptoms were allowed home.\nIt found that of those admitted to hospital, whose median age was 65, only 4.4% were regular smokers. Among those released home, with a median age of 44, 5.3% smoked.\nTaking into account the age and sex of the patients, the researchers discovered the number of smokers was much lower than that in the general population estimated by the French health authority Sant\u00e9 Publique France at about 40% for those aged 44-53 and between 8.8% and 11.3% for those aged 65-75.\nThe renowned French neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux, who reviewed the study, suggested the nicotine might stop the virus from reaching cells in the body preventing its spread. Nicotine may also lessen the overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system that has been found in the most severe cases of Covid-19 infection.\nThe findings are to be verified in a clinical study in which frontline health workers, hospital patients with the Covid-19 virus and those in intensive care will be given nicotine patches.\nThe results confirm a Chinese study published at the end of March in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested only 12.6% of 1,000 people infected with the virus were smokers while the number of smokers in China is around 28%.\nIn France, figures from Paris hospitals showed that of 11,000 patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19, 8.5% were smokers. The total number of smokers in France is estimated at around 25.4%.\n\u201cOur cross-sectional study strongly suggests that those who smoke every day are much less likely to develop a symptomatic or severe infection with Sars-CoV-2 compared with the general population,\u201d the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re report authors wrote.\n\u201cThe effect is significant.

She was taken off the field on a stretcher, and the crowd rose as one to applaud her, while teammates and opponents alike flocked to give her their well wishes.\nIt seems every year there is huge growth in women\u2019s sport. Each new year brings bigger crowd figures, new competitions, increased television coverage and new records being set. But as the nation took to social media to share in the emotion of Phillips\u2019 anterior cruciate ligament injury, it was clear there was another, less quantifiable, factor at play.\nEarlier this month, journalist Isabelle Westbury faced backlash on Twitter when she was critical of the criteria for Britain\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year award.\n\u201cBen Stokes should win based on the criteria (athlete whose 2019 actions have most captured UK public\u2019s imagination),\u201d Westbury tweeted. \u201cBut I think the criteria need to be changed because I think it\u2019s fundamentally disadvantageous towards women.\u201d\nWestbury argued athletes can\u2019t capture the public\u2019s imagination if they\u2019re not in the public eye. While this is undoubtedly true in the UK, women\u2019s sport in Australia in 2019 made huge strides towards breaking down these barriers.\nFrom the AFLW grand final, to the Matildas embarking on their World Cup campaign where, despite a disappointing round of 16 finish, the footballers were again named the team to whom Australians feel the strongest emotional connection.\nMatildas\u2019 striker Sam Kerr broke records of her own, signing a deal with Chelsea that made her the world\u2019s most expensive female footballer, before being named the best female footballer on the planet by the Guardian\u2019s panel of judges.\nKerr was just one of an elite group of Australian female athletes who took the world by storm and led the charge to push women\u2019s sport to the top of the nation\u2019s sporting agenda. Ashleigh Barty joined her with a breakthrough grand slam win at the French Open. The win sparked Australia\u2019s renewed interest in the women\u2019s competition at Wimbledon and although Barty couldn\u2019t repeat her Roland Garros heroics, she finished the year ranked No1 and cemented her place in Australia\u2019s sporting elite.\nUnlike Barty, Hannah Green appeared to come from nowhere when she took out the women\u2019s PGA championship at Hazeltine and became the first Australian woman to win a golf major since Karrie Webb in 2006. Green\u2019s win dragged women\u2019s golf back into the spotlight and thrust her into the hearts and minds of the Australian public.\nWith the Australian men\u2019s cricket team still emerging from the wreckage of sandpaper-gate, the women\u2019s team were more than ready to pick up the pieces of the public\u2019s broken hearts and give them something to celebrate. The complete dominance of the team in the 2019 Ashes series paved the way for a home summer that started with Alyssa Healy\u2019s world-record 148 in a T20 international against Sri Lanka. Healy later won the ICC\u2019s women\u2019s T20 cricketer of the year award, with teammate Ellyse Perry taking out the top honour of international women\u2019s cricketer of the year.\nFrom there, the first standalone Women\u2019s Big Bash League season brought a 25% increase in television viewers with over 375,000 viewers tuning in to watch Healy and Perry\u2019s Sydney Sixers take on crosstown rivals Sydney Thunder in the season opener. Staging the season as a series of carnival weekends around the country proved a hit with fans and players alike as the competition introduced the public to an earlier start to the cricket season.\nWith the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final looking to break world-record crowd figures for the final at the MCG in March, Australia\u2019s women\u2019s cricketers have shown they are more than up to the task of drawing big numbers and building a deep connection with their fans.\nNetball has long been the frontrunner in Australian women\u2019s sport and despite inroads being made by many others, it continues to set the standard in professionalism and high-performance culture. This was backed up by a strong Super Netball season with over 900,000 people tuning in to watch the NSW Swifts win their first title since 2008 and a total of 5.939m viewers on television across the season.\nThe Diamonds\u2019 one-goal loss to New Zealand in July\u2019s Netball World Cup only increased the public\u2019s hunger for the old rivalry; huge crowds flocked to the Constellation Cup games in Sydney and Perth to see Australia retain the trophy by the slimmest of margins.\nWhile there is still a long way to go in dismantling the systemic barriers that have prevented women\u2019s sport from taking its place in the Australian sporting landscape, 2019 will go down as the year that Australia\u2019s female athletes shone so brightly that the public had no choice but to consider their imaginations well and truly captured.", "label": 0}, "text-470": {"text": "Why did Donald Trump exclude the UK from his coronavirus travel ban?\nDonald Trump\u2019s contorted spin on the travel restrictions he announced on Wednesday night, including pinning the blame for \u201ca foreign disease\u201d on the European Union, revealed a mind largely driven by politics and not science.\nThe impression he sought to create was that the EU bureaucracy had let the world down by failing to take necessary steps to slow the spread of coronavirus, but the United Kingdom, legally outside the EU and physically an island, was exonerated.\n\u201cWe will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,\u201d the president said, specifically adding that these restrictions would not apply to the UK, without mentioning any other exemptions.\nTrump\u2019s greatest friend in the UK, Nigel Farage, applauded the drastic but necessary measures. \u201cThe UK is now being treated as an independent country,\u201d he tweeted. The rewards of Brexit were already being reaped, in what looked like a big win for British diplomacy and the special relationship.\nBut the reality, once the true details of the Presidential Proclamation were released, was somewhat different.\nThe White House briefing paper said the US was closing its borders to foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen area in the last 14 days, which would apply to any British person who had recently been in the 26-nation visa-free area.\nFive other EU countries were also excluded from the US travel ban. So if the announcement was a big win for London\u2019s diplomatic heft, the same could be said of Bucharest, Nicosia, Zagreb, Dublin and Sofia, the capitals of five EU countries outside Schengen.\nThe reality is that no European diplomat, including in the UK foreign office, had been forewarned that Trump, after a week of mishandling the crisis, was to put the EU in the dock in a bid to try to reinsert himself at the helm of the crisis.\nMany explanations have been offered for why Trump presented his announcement as he did. His prejudice against the EU is well known, and targeting Schengen countries gave him a chance to exempt the US\u2019s natural allies Ireland and the UK.\nIt may be that Trump has never heard of Schengen, Luxembourg or the Schengen free travel area. His spinners thought, rather than bamboozle an American public, and possibly the president, with the complexities of EU border areas, the neater impression should be left that the EU and not Brexit Britain was being targeted.\nAn alternative explanation is that Trump had only cursorily acquainted himself with his own announcement, and misspoke. Elsewhere in his statement he twice said that goods from Europe would also be banned, a mistake that was hastily \u201cwalked back\u201d by his briefers.\nIt may also be that the White House itself was not very convinced at the rationale of picking on the Schengen area for exclusion. The official explanation was the Schengen area had the largest number of coronavirus cases outside China. As of 12 March, the White House said the number of cases in the 26 Schengen countries was 17,442, with 711 deaths, and showed high continuous growth in infection areas. In total, Schengen countries had exported 201 cases to 53 countries.\nMoreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen countries made the task of preventing the coronavirus from spreading difficult, the White House said.\nThis ignored the large number of cases in the UK, the lack of virus testing in the US and the fact that some Schengen area countries, such as Poland and Denmark, had already effectively closed their borders to EU citizens.\nIronically, the announcement represents a headache for the UK as its transport officials try to work out whether it will become a transit hub for Europeans seeking to reach the US.\nTrump, after a week as a bystander, has put his imprimatur on the coronavirus crisis, and in a way that hammers UK shares. Larry Summers, the former chief economist at the World Bank, commented: \u201cThe president has set what I believe is a new world record for presidential market value destruction. He destroys about $500bn in equity market value in course of an 11-minute speech. Destruction roughly doubles as investors take an hour to analyse the speech. Loose lips sink ships. Imprudent rhetoric sinks markets.\u201d\nTrump has form on politically motivated but arbitrary travel bans, notably on Muslims. In January 2017 he barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. The travel ban was later struck down as unconstitutional by the courts on the grounds that there was no rationale to have a ban that put religion at its heart. But this did not stop him from using the threat of a ban as a bargaining chip with Gulf states.\nIn this latest ban, the guiding principle may not be religion, but animus towards an institution that challenges nationalism. Either way, the decision, and the manner in which it was taken, has left even British politicians appalled. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, warned: \u201cHow countries work together in moments of crisis will shape how we cooperate after.

It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally.\nWhile the diverse regions of the US will experience climate change differently, none will escape it entirely.\nNorth-east: Ocean and coastal ecosystems are at risk from rising sea level, acidification, and stronger storms. North-eastern cities that are covered in concrete and asphalt stay hotter at night and can lead to more heat-related deaths. Average annual temperatures have increased between 1F (0.6C) in West Virginia and 3F or more in New England.\nSouth-east: Threats range from extreme downpours to dangerously high temperatures and humidity and new diseases. The region\u2019s coastal and inland low-lying areas are at risk for flooding. The southern portion of the Appalachian mountains, high-growth cities and large rural areas all are vulnerable to climate change too. The number of warm nights, above 75F, has doubled, which can hurt agriculture.\nMidwest: People will see more poor air quality days, extreme heat events and heavy rains. As a crop hub, the midwest is suffering from higher temperatures, as well as higher humidity and precipitation, which erode soil, allow pests and pathogens to flourish and degrade stored grain. The region represents 18% of gross domestic product. Forests there will also suffer from droughts, invasive species and pests. The Great Lakes are already dealing with pollution that could be made worse by warmer water.\nGreat Plains: In the northern Great Plains, precipitation changes make water management harder for people, crops, livestock, ecosystems and energy production. In the southern Great Plains, an increasing population and migration from rural areas to cities will be strained by climate change.\nNorth-west: Warm and dry conditions have led to record-low snowpack, water scarcity and wildfires. Climate is likely to be more variable in the region, because of the Pacific ocean. Periods of prolonged drought could be interrupted with years of heavy rainfall from atmospheric rivers and El Ni\u00f1o winters. The looming crisis also threatens outdoor recreation.\nSouth-west: With some of the hottest and driest parts of the US and fast-growing cities, the south-west is at high risk from climate change, including more droughts. The California coast is already suffering from sea-level rise and ocean warming, and the state is being ravaged by wildfires. Freshwater supplies are increasingly difficult to manage, and the country relies on speciality crops from the south-west and and the technology sector in California.\nAlaska: The state has warmed twice as fast as the global average since the middle of the 20th century. As part of the Arctic it is on the \u201cfrontlines\u201d of climate change, the report says. Retreating sea ice is threatening fisheries, wildlife, subsistence activities and tourism. Lack of sea ice also contributes to storm surge and coastal flooding. Species are migrating north from warmer water, changing ecosystems. Environmental changes are especially hard on Indigenous communities. Wildfires are also getting worse.\nIslands: All islands are at high risk to sea-level rise. Hawaii and other Pacific islands are in danger of tropical cyclones, coastal flooding and erosion and threats to freshwater supplies. As temperatures rise and cloud cover decreases, increasing evaporation can reduce water supply while raising water demand. Most of the state has seen rainfall decreases since 1920. In the Caribbean, sea-level rise will cause saltwater intrusion and damage freshwater supplies. Rainfall patterns will change and flooding will be likely.

However, it wasn\u2019t always this way, as author Andrew Montford explains:\n\u201cWhen shale gas first came on the scene, coverage was very positive: gas was seen as a low-carbon alternative to coal.

And as the UK shale industry is poised to start fracking for gas once more, all the signs are that the media are ready to start the scare stories again.\n\u201cThe media are mostly hopelessly biased on the subject of shale gas\u201d says Montford.\n\u201cThey tend to recount wild stories and then move on without correcting the record.

Kelton will also be meeting with businesspeople at private events organised by accounting firms.\nThe idea of a Green New Deal has been championed by New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has pushed the idea within the Democratic Party.\nIn the version that forms part of Sanders\u2019 presidential pitch, it would involve the US government spending US$16.3tn on decarbonising the economy, including by moving to renewable energy, upgrading public transport and funding a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers who lose their jobs in the resources industry as a result of the changes.\nThe deal \u201cis an ambitious response to the imminent threat of climate change on a scale that is commensurate with the threat that we are facing\u201d, Kelton said.\n\u201cTo do something like this in 10 years time requires a mobilisation that is sort of parallel to what we did in world war two\u201d.\nShe said the economy would look very different after a Green New Deal.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a care economy, we\u2019re caring for our community, we\u2019re caring for people and we\u2019re caring for the planet,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou can imagine millions and millions of people being put to work doing jobs that are associated with building a cleaner, safer, more secure and more prosperous economy.\u201d\nShe said a lot of people thought there was a tension \u201cbetween jobs and growth or taking care of the planet\u201d.\n\u201cWhat the Green New Deal says is that we don\u2019t have to pick one.\n\u201cPeople have more secure jobs, higher paying, better paying, more prosperous economies \u2013 more savings, more wealth.\u201d\nKelton said Australia could \u201cabsolutely\u201d benefit from a similar program.\n\u201cThis is definitely not conceptually a program that couldn\u2019t work in any country,\u201d she said.\nShe mocked the idea it was \u201ctoo hard\u201d.\n\u201cImagine if we had said that after the bombing of Pearl Harbor \u2013 oh, I don\u2019t know if we can fight back against the Nazi invasion and the threat.

But while many delegates spoke about the importance of climate issues, actual action was harder to find.\nLuisa Neubauer, a 23-year-old German climate activist, said she had met the chief executive of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, at Davos this week to press him to abandon a contract to supply rail signalling to a mine in Australia.\nThe Adani project would be one of the world\u2019s largest coalmines, and Neubauer said such fossil fuel activity needed to be curbed by companies and investors. Otherwise the Paris agreement\u2019s goal of keeping global heating to 2C this year could not be met, she said.\nDavos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it \u2013 and\u00a0the elaborate system of badges\u00a0reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.\nFor critics, \u201cDavos man\u201d is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u00a0a big waste of time.\u00a0\nThe 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you add up all the contracts that have been signed by today on fossil fuel projects, we will be far beyond 2C,\u201d said Neubauer. \u201cSome of those contracts, if not all of them, will have to be cancelled if we want to actually do something about Paris.\n\u201cThis is not a radical demand, this is a rational demand,\u201d she added.\nOn Thursday, the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said climate activists should recognise the impact of fossil fuel divestment on jobs, and said Thunberg should go study economics before offering advice.\nThunberg said such barbs, like Donald Trump\u2019s criticism, had no effect on her.\n\u201cWe are being criticised like that all the time. If we cared about that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do what we do,\u201d she said, before leading a Fridays for Future protest in the ski resort.\nSome climate actions were announced at Davos, including a push to plant 1tn trees, which Donald Trump backed.\nThunberg warned earlier this week that planting trees was not enough to tackle the climate crisis. But Micah White, the co-founder of the Occupy Wall Street movement, said the trillion tree campaign would work as a Trojan horse to help mobilise people to fight the climate emergency.\n\u201cI love the trillion tree campaign, because hundreds of millions of people will need to be mobilised at the grass roots,\u201d he said on the sidelines of WEF. \u201cTo actually mobilise that number of people, and plant that number of trees, will be such a systemic disruption of our day-to-day lives that it will be revolutionary.\u201d\nWhite said corporations would have to tell staff, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come into work this week, we\u2019re all planting trees\u201d, and governments will have to deposit trees in all the schools, to actually carry out the plan.\nWhite attended Davos with a manifesto titled \u201cAn Alliance Of Opposites\u201d.

At a time when it feels like the very terms of our lives are being renegotiated by the day, we should be vigilant of those who see in the crumbling of our social and economic norms an unprecedented opportunity to advance ideas that may, in less turbulent times, be taboo.\nWhat might this look like in sporting terms? Perhaps, in the first instance, it could look like the sort of naked opportunism being advanced by the West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady in her Sun column on Saturday. \u201cAs games in both the Premier League and in the EFL are affected,\u201d Brady dictates to her ghostwriter, \u201cthe only fair and reasonable thing to do is declare the whole season null and void.\u201d \nBrady was quick to \u201cclarify\u201d her comments but not before many had pointed out that her own club would benefit handsomely from a voided season, heroically avoiding relegation from the Premier League on goal difference: a Great Escape to rival their remarkable revival under Alan Curbishley more than a decade ago. For \u201cTevez and Mascherano 06-07\u201d, read \u201cBrady and Covid 19-20\u201d.\nThen again, if we\u2019re rewriting the past, why stop there? Given their ignominious history, West Ham must wish they could declare the past four decades of English football null and void.\nMight big European football clubs find this is their moment to form a breakaway league?\nSetting aside for one moment the crassness of engaging in sporting politics at a time when people are dying by the thousand, you had to marvel at the simple and transparent ineptitude at work here. As a star of The Apprentice, Brady must know the first rule of negotiation: never show your full hand. And yet, if sporting administration were composed entirely of galaxy brains like Brady\u2019s, we could probably rest easy. Alas, when it comes to Machiavellian chicanery, it\u2019s highly likely the ham-fisted manoeuvrings of east London\u2019s dildo siblings are just the tip of the iceberg.\nAlready there are the first rumblings that the imminent financial turmoil faced by many sports may force them into those famously euphemistic \u201ctough choices\u201d. Perhaps it was purely coincidence, for instance, that this week on Monday an extremely well-sourced report in the Daily Mail suggested coronavirus may force several professional rugby union clubs into bankruptcy.\nFurther down, the article suggests one proposed remedy: selling the Six Nations television rights to a subscription channel, a prospect that over recent weeks has met with fierce resistance. But that was under the old rules.

It\u2019s difficult to be precise about this without verging into conspiracy theory but is it so outlandish, for example, to ask if big European football clubs who have long been pushing for a lucrative breakaway league may, in the current leadership vacuum, spot their moment to strike?\nHow to solve the fixture gridlock when football finally resumes? One of the solutions being mooted is temporarily scrapping the League Cup or doing away with FA Cup replays \u2013 two moves, you will notice, many clubs have been tacitly advocating for years.\nHow to save lower-league clubs facing the loss of crucial match-day revenue? Simple: \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d with larger clubs that could over time turn them into de facto subsidiaries or feeders.\nHow to rationalise the truncated cricket season? Pare back the County Championship and the Blast, or \u2013 as the former England and Wales Cricket Board director Andy Nash believes will happen \u2013 merge the latter competition with the Hundred, recasting it not just as the centrepiece of the summer but the financial lifeline for an ailing game.\nWith the help of an overactive imagination and a long period of self-isolation, you could probably come up with a few more.

In 1982, 17-year-old Spike is undergoing a political awakening. He attends a northern comprehensive school which used to be a grammar until its purpose was \u201cfundamentally altered by the whims of politicians\u201d (it still has a massive Corinthian portico where its pupils like to defecate). The school isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s farcically unfit for purpose. Spike lives with his father, who works as a faceless civil servant and whose only passion is building scale models of early industrial machines; his mother left years before. The capitalist nuclear family has failed Spike. He wonders if this is where his interest in politics and \u201csocial justice, or rather injustice\u201d comes from: politics, he says flatly, \u201chopes to improve individual lives\u201d. Whether or not Hensher believes this is moot.\nSpike quickly falls in with a set of self-styled radicals. There\u2019s Percy Ogden, the argumentative group leader, the sort of logorrheic boy with a passion for argument who will be immediately recognisable to anyone who has ever been at school,and his sexpot female counterpart, Tracy Cartwright, who quotes Russian anarchists (\u201cI love, love, love Bakunin \u2026 He\u2019s my god\u201d) as part of her seduction routine. Then there\u2019s Mohammed Ahmed, in flight from his inner-city life \u201camong the grocers, the mosque\u201d, and Eric Milne, \u201cwho had been told by a master that he should take up sprinting, for no other reason than that he was black. Injustice was strong in him.\u201d Quietly aggressive James Frinton, son of a failing pub landlord father and a depressive mother who self-medicates with Eartha Kitt videos, is a less easily recognisable type. Which is not to say that Hensher deals in stereotypes: he is excellent at making these familiar incarnations of adolescent rage seem fresh.\nThrough Ogden and his \u201cphalanx\u201d of teenage subversives, Spike meets a local group of twentysomethings, members of the Trotskyite Spartacist League, engaged in advancing the revolution through minor acts of civil disobedience. He is impressed by matronly, comfortable Kate, \u201can implausible and unsuspected hurler of bottles of piss, an innocuous painter of walls, a smooth-faced smasher of windows\u201d, but it\u2019s Joaquin, a charismatic refugee from Pinochet\u2019s Chile, who becomes his lover and lifelong partner. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d announces a smitten Spike, \u201cI resolved to devote my life to the liberation of the urban proletariat.\u201d\nWe may smile knowingly, but he means it, whereas the others don\u2019t. The novel moves easily between Thatcherite Britain and the present, by which time everyone except Spike and Joaquin has shed his or her youthful convictions. Ogden has become a journalist with a facile line in wokeness, Kate is a mediocre but lauded poet, Milne a peer and QC, and James Frinton is not just home secretary, but has turned into a Tory (though as someone points out, \u2018he had to do that before he could be turned into the Home Secretary\u2019). His onetime friends are proof, as Spike remarks, that \u201cthere is so much difference between the espousal of principles and the living of lives\u201d. The political purity of his beliefs, on the other hand, \u201chas been untainted by any deals with what may be achieved now, today, this minute\u201d, although he adds ambiguously: \u201cI had kept my principles. I had remained what I was, a boy.\u201d Have the others sold out for the sake of power, or simply grown up? Tracy is dead, and the blurred circumstances of her death are bound up with this question.\nThis book is bound to be seen as a satire on the left, but in fact its keynote is a deep anger with politics\nThe mystery of Tracy\u2019s death is intercut with Spike\u2019s memories of a trip to East Germany in 1987, two years before the fall of the Wall. During this visit he experiences the reality of the socialist state at first hand, in the most traumatic way. But as far as abuse goes, there seems to be little to choose between the \u201cpunitive system\u201d of hardline socialism and the ruthlessness of capitalism. When Spike returns to \u201cthis quiet corner\u201d of post-reunification Germany on a walking holiday with Joaquin in 2020, it\u2019s clear that his core belief in revolution hasn\u2019t changed. Hensher treats us to a brilliant set piece: the two middle-aged anarchists, hiking along the old DDR border and eating chicken curry in their depressing mock-medieval B&B, whose owner turns out to have a revelatory \u2013 connection with the past.\nThis book is bound to be seen as a satire on the left. But in fact its keynote is a deep anger and disillusionment with politics, a lack of faith in all systems. Whether tragedy or farce, history, as Spike realises, \u201cis what most people succeed in ignoring\u201d, to their cost. Positioning his story within the frame of current events is a clever move on Hensher\u2019s part. We\u2019re reminded that \u201cthis year, the island on which we were born or made our home tried to extricate itself from the continent. Went sailing westwards, to borrow a metaphor, like a raft of stone.\u201d Our national political structures, it seems, have become profoundly unfit for purpose too. Rejecting everyday politics and the shortsighted narratives it imposes on us, Spike waits instead for the mass \u201cupheaval\u201d that will \u201ctransform everything beyond the ordinary imagination\u201d.

The campest Met Gala ever, G2, 8 May), fashion\u2019s most exclusive evening, touched upon all but one aspect of the event: environmental impact. The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government\u2019s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste.\nThe crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change. The pinnacle of slow fashion \u2013 wherein ideas typically take nine months to materialise into a single product \u2013 may seem an odd method for changing the throwaway culture of fast fashion. However, the Met Gala\u2019s role in fostering creativity to heights generally considered extravagant should be seen as the ideal platform for innovation. Competing ideas for how to green glamour at the level of high fashion, which can more readily assume risk, would pave the way for the gradual adoption of more sustainable methods by the wider fashion industry.

At a second hearing with MEPs, Goulard expressed regret for a lucrative job she held with a US thinktank while she was an MEP.\nAn \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said Goulard\u2019s competence and European commitment had been recognised by all, but she had been \u201cthe object of a political game that affects the commission as a whole\u201d.\nMacron later insisted he was \u201cvery relaxed\u201d as what mattered to him was the portfolio France would get at the commission. \u201cI need to understand what has been in play. Resentment, perhaps pettiness. But I need to understand.\u201d\nGoulard was an early supporter of Macron in the European parliament after the upstart presidential candidate formed La R\u00e9publique En March bidding to break the stranglehold of the established centre-right and centre-left. She became his defence minister but resigned after a month when a magistrate launched a preliminary investigation into allegations her party misused European parliament funds.\nNominated as France\u2019s EU commissioner, she faced hostile questions from MEPs over those allegations and her work for the Los Angeles-based Berggruen Institute from October 2013 to the end of 2015, when she was paid more than \u20ac10,000 a month while working as an MEP.\nOn Thursday, she said she deserved the presumption of innocence over the allegations, which have never been tested in court. But she voiced regret for the thinktank job which she said had cast a doubt over her integrity and independence, values that she said were of \u201cthe utmost importance\u201d to her.\nGoulard\u2019s vulnerabilities were heightened because MEPs have already rejected a centre-right commissioner candidate (from Hungary), as well as a socialist (a Romanian), meaning the parliament\u2019s two biggest groups were looking for the weak points in her liberal group.\nSome in the parliament suggested the outcome was \u201cWeber\u2019s revenge\u201d, as Macron had crushed the hopes of Manfred Weber, a German centre-right MEP leader who aspired to lead the European commission but who was blocked by the French president.\nIn a statement, the liberal group (Renew Europe) said it deeply regretted the vote against \u201can excellent, skilled and committed pro-European commissioner\u201d adding that she had \u201cpaid the price of European and domestic petty politics over an objective assessment of the commissioner candidates\u201d.\nThe defeat is likely to trigger recriminations in the group over how they managed to lose Goulard in such a decisive way: 82 of the 112 MEPs eligible to vote on her appointment voted against her.\nGoulard\u2019s critics said the case showed the problems with the current system for assessing conflicts of interests.\n\u201cWe obviously did not vote for Goulard,\u201d said Manon Aubry of the radical left Unbowed France party. \u201cEU citizens won\u2019t put their trust in their institutions when a commissioner sees absolutely no problem in making \u20ac10,000 a month from a private lobby in addition to her MEP salary.\u201d\nThe debacle has raised questions about whether the current European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will be asked to extend his mandate beyond 1 November.\nVon der Leyen, nominated as his successor in July, can only assume office following a positive vote in favour of her 26 commissioners. She now has three gaps, with neither a French nor a Romanian candidate. (Hungary proposed a career diplomat, Oliv\u00e9r Varh\u00e9lyi, after L\u00e1zsl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi was rejected over an alleged conflict of interest, but the new nominee has yet to clear the parliament).\nFollowing the vote, Von der Leyen met MEP group leaders and the European parliament president. \u201cWith so much at stake, it is now necessary, together with parliament, to speed up the process so that Europe can act swiftly,\u201d she said in a statement that referred to the tasks of the next five years, including Brexit, climate change, trade, migration and digitalisation. \u201cAt the same time, all involved in the process need sufficient time to approach the next steps with care.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-488": {"text": "Brexit\u2019s legacy for England will be politics as sectarian as Northern Ireland\u2019s\nYou could call it Ireland\u2019s sweet revenge, and both the timing and the irony would be historically exquisite. It would come just as Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless government tries to bully Dublin on future Irish customs arrangements and as large parts of the Tory party salivate for a no-deal Brexit that will cast the Irish peace process casually aside. But if the 2019 general election that Johnson craves takes place, it may not be long before, politically speaking, Brexit Britain comes to resemble Northern Ireland.\nTo understand that this possible Ulsterisation of British politics is a genuinely serious prospect, step back a bit and consider the way that electoral behaviour has been evolving in Britain. Ever since 1964, political scientists, mainly based at Nuffield College, Oxford, have worked on the British Election Study (BES). For more than half a century they have tracked the decline of the old industrial-based two-party system in which general elections were fought between the Conservatives and Labour, who battled for the floating voters in the middle ground across the land.\nToday\u2019s electoral politics are fundamentally different. A long-term trend of dealignment from the two big parties means that voters are no longer loyal battalions of partisans. Millions of individual voters are now happy to switch between an increasing array of parties. In 2015, 43% of them voted for a different party from the one they had supported in 2010. In 2017, 33% switched from their 2015 vote. In 2019, a similar kaleidoscopic change seems certain. Tellingly, a BES study of these two recent elections, due for publication in December, will be titled Electoral Shocks: the Volatile Voter in a Turbulent World.\nElectoral volatility was already a growing trend in the late 20th century. But Jane Green, one of the study\u2019s authors, says electoral shocks, which have come thick and fast in the 21st century, have accelerated the process. She cites five big ones: immigration and the rise of Ukip after 2004; the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession; the Liberal Democrats\u2019 decision to go into coalition in 2010; Scotland\u2019s independence referendum in 2014; and, finally, the Brexit vote in 2016. Each has reshaped politics and added to the impact of volatility.\nThe Brexit vote is the mother and father of these shocks, not only in itself but in its prolonged duration. Even today, more than three years on, it is still creating big aftershocks. Failure to leave the EU by the original 29 March deadline helped trigger the Brexit party\u2019s success in the EU elections, and in turn brought down Theresa May. Another such shock is likely when parliament reconvenes on 19 October after next week\u2019s EU summit, and on 31 October, when Britain will again either leave or stay longer in the EU. What happens on the end of the month deadline will rearrange the board.\nFew are foolish enough to predict with certainty how a 2019 election will play out. The 2017 election saw a swing back to two-party politics but a significant reshuffling of the two parties\u2019 electoral bases. Two years on that picture has fractured afresh, with the rise of the Brexit party and the revival of the Lib Dems. Today\u2019s unknowns, as Donald Rumsfeld might have said, are still unknown. Tellingly, the most authoritative voice of caution comes from the dean and doyen of British political scientists, David Butler, 95 next week, who told a BES event on Tuesday that in 70 years of studying elections, \u201cI have never felt more totally confused and uncertain\u201d about the outcome. When Butler says that, it is like David Attenborough telling you there is a climate crisis.\nNevertheless, there is now a real possibility that in the next election Brexit will become in England and Wales what the union has become in Scotland: the decisive divide in electoral behaviour. Brexit is important, salient and highly divisive. Overwhelmingly, people are in one camp or the other. This would not mean that other issues, including economic divides, no longer apply at all. But these other issues would tend to be refracted through the prism of Brexit.\nThat is certainly the view of Johnson and his strategists. They want a Brexit election. So do the Brexit party, the Lib Dems, the Greens and the SNP. Only the Labour party acts as if the election will be about more traditional issues. For some voters, that will be true. But Labour could find its votes shaped by Brexit in spite of its own best efforts because 68% of its 2017 voters are remainers.\nBut if Brexit is reshaping the electoral battle, it is in reality two separate battles. The Tories and the Brexit party are battling for leave voters, while Labour, the Lib Dems, Greens and nationalists battle for remainers. Very few voters sit in the middle of the road on Brexit or the cultural issues that are so closely associated with it.\nRemind you of anything? It should. Northern Ireland has had two electorates for decades. Parties battle in one or the other, leaving slim pickings for those who try to reach across the divide. As Geoffrey Evans, another BES author, put it this week: \u201cBritish politics is no longer about the battle for the middle ground. It\u2019s become like the Northern Ireland system.\u201d And Evans adds a sobering further thought, that in Northern Ireland the winners are the parties that voters trust not to give in to the other side. \u201cCould the Liberal Democrats be the Sinn F\u00e9in of all this,\u201d he wonders.\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s divides are rooted in centuries of religious divide. The Brexit divide in Britain is far more recent. But it is rooted in identities and anger, too. If Brexit does become the defining issue in mid-21st-century British politics, the hope of a country coming back together could be as fragile as the dream of Irish peace now is, and just as fraught.\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist", "label": 0}, "text-489": {"text": "Climate-damaging products should come with smoking-style warnings\nCigarette packets with grisly warnings of the consequences of smoking are intended to deter smokers. Now a group of public health experts says similar warnings should appear on high-carbon products, from airline tickets and energy bills to petrol pumps, to show consumers the health impacts of the climate crisis.\nWarning labels would be a cheap but potentially highly effective intervention that would make consumers aware of the impact of their purchases on climate breakdown, according to the experts.\n\u201cWarning labels connect the abstract threat of the climate emergency with the use of fossil fuels in the here and now, drawing attention to the true cost of fossil fuels pictorially or quantitatively,\u201d they write in the British Medical Journal. \u201cThey sensitise people to the consequences of their actions, representing nudges designed to encourage users to choose alternatives to fossil fuels, thus increasing demand for zero-carbon renewable energy.\u201d\nIn many countries smoking labels have grown more graphic in recent years, with pictures of diseased lungs, children breathing smoke and blunt messages covering most of the packaging, in place of the anodyne \u201csmoking can damage your health\u201d warnings of the past.\nHigh-carbon health labels could be similarly graphic, especially if they highlighted the damage to health from air pollution caused by fossil fuels, such as the exhaust gases from diesel vehicles. They could include pictures of damaged lungs, or highlight severe weather such as flooding, or show the bodies of people who have died because of heatwaves, said Mike Gill, a former regional director of public health for south-east England, and a co-author of the letter.\nIn some countries, messages could include the increased spread of dengue fever and malaria driven by global heating, while there should also be scope to warn about the effects of environmental degradation caused by climate breakdown, and the harmful effects on water and food supplies, he added.\n\u201cThe messages, including their pictorial element, should be stark and arresting, and they should relate directly to those effects known directly to affect health, such as air pollution causing heart disease and asthma,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe immediate task will be to get some really arresting designs produced, such as we already have for cigarette packet warnings.\u201d\nLabels warning of the damage to health would make more of an impression on people than messages focusing on the impact on the environment, wrote the experts, who included four professors of environmental health in the UK, US and India.\nSmoking labels have been accompanied by stricter bans on advertising, and the authors of the BMJ article want to see similar restrictions on advertising by fossil fuel companies, including better policing of misleading claims about investments in renewable energy that represent a minority of a fossil fuel company\u2019s portfolio.\nPutting labels on high-carbon goods and services would require government intervention, and the authors hope that the UK could lead the way as hosts of the crunch UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for Glasgow this November.\nThe experts argue that the warnings could be swiftly adopted so as to \u201creduce the risk of a rapid rebound in greenhouse gas emissions as the economy expands\u201d after the coronavirus crisis.\nGreen campaigners have also made similar suggestions on putting warning labels on high-carbon goods and services.

Digest any of his musings on football, and Foster\u2019s view of sport as a vehicle to effect change, break down boundaries and bring people together is palpable.\nThe former Socceroo and SBS presenter is also a dab hand at making things happen. Foster was the driving force behind the release last year of Hakeem al-Araibi, the Bahraini footballer detained in Thailand, and has recently campaigned on behalf of asylum seekers stranded on Nauru and Papua New Guinea.\nNow, Covid-19 is in his crosshairs. As politicians grapple with the social and economic carnage caused by the global health crisis, Foster is calling on sport in Australia, now that there is no sport, to unite and pitch in during this extraordinary time of need.\n\u201cSport is closed down across the country. That is a trauma for many people in itself. But broader society is hurting, we\u2019re all hurting together,\u201d Foster tells Guardian Australia. \u201cOne of the best ways for sport to recover from all this is to connect to each other and to the broader Australian community. Sporting clubs are important social connectors.\u201d\nFoster is calling on the multitudes connected with community sport in Australia to redeploy their volunteering efforts and play not for points this season, but for lives. It\u2019s a grand concept. And if it sounds like a movement, that\u2019s because it is: the #PlayForLives movement.\n\u201cNow that sport is being closed own, we have participants who were training and competing for four to five hours per week,\u201d Foster says. \u201cWe\u2019re asking all of sport to step up and apply that to not only their own community but to the rest of Australia. What\u2019s occurred at community level is that many of the social service delivery agencies, who are making meals, delivering hot meals, driving people around, their funding has dried up and many of them have had to close the doors. The load on those that are still existing has expanded exponentially.\n\u201cWe want to put sport at the service of the Australian community. Sport has a number of values which are really important: teamwork, solidarity and endurance. The need for volunteering in the last couple of weeks has become more acute than ever. We\u2019re asking all participants who were going to play to put themselves forward to volunteer in some way.\u201d\n#PlayForLives Sport\u2019s role now is not to play for points, but livesWe can no longer play onfield & are putting ourselves at the service of essential servicesFootball clubs are volunteering for community organisations & charities including Adam & IGet in touch\ud83d\udc47@WOBFC \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/R67p5l7cXY\nSuch a call to arms might seem precarious at a time when human movement is governed by social distancing and lockdowns. But Foster envisages a broad spectrum of assistance.\n\u201cThere are millions of ways we can help. If we create a sporting coalition for humanity, a sporting volunteer workforce, people can add their own professional skills. People are working from home now. The time they would\u2019ve been training and playing they can now use to apply their professional skills as a designer, a lawyer, an IT expert.\n\u201cSafety is the absolute priority for everyone right now. Nevertheless, the need for people to physically go and help pack boxes, to drive cancer patients to hospital, to drive trucks, to deliver food to refugees and vulnerable families is chronic.\n\u201cFor some it will be volunteering in community and taking every precaution under government guidelines, for others it might be from home in a digital sense. That\u2019s a matter for the non-government organisations. Red Cross will be interested in delivering digital messaging campaigns, whereas Foodbank and Meals On Wheels will need us packing boxes to get to families that night. There\u2019s a triad of sport, government and NGOs that need to work together right now.\u201d\nWhat started out as a good idea that Foster floated to his Waverley Old Boys Over 35s teammates has taken off, with a variety of sporting bodies and public figures pledging their commitment to #PlayForLives.\n\u201cFootball has responded beautifully. There is a tremendous amount of desire within the game to step forward. I\u2019m expecting that FFA [Football Federation Australia] will be getting involved in the near term. But this need is far too great. One sport can\u2019t cover it,\u201d he says. To that end Foster has succeeded in getting the NSWRL on board, with Brad Fittler and Ben Elias to serve in ambassadorial roles. Foster says discussions with Rugby Australia and the AFL are progressing well, while Liz Ellis has picked up the ball on behalf of the netball community.\n\u201cWe need both levels of sport involved. We need national level for scale and we need grassroots community for connectedness, for relationships, for personal support. A top-down approach is great because we can scale really quickly and get a lot of information to a lot of people. Equally, the grassroots clubs need to take ownership of this because they\u2019re the ones who will be in the community.\u201d\nMany people Foster is asking for help will be experiencing their own struggles as the coronavirus outbreak bites industry and forces chunks of the workforce onto reduced hours or out of work altogether.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got historic levels of job losses, people on the bread line who don\u2019t know where their next meal is coming from. Sport is experiencing its own financial trauma. But equally we are a strong community that understands resilience. What sport teaches us is that there are horrible times, but they always end. In sport, there\u2019s always a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\u201cIn sport we are used to facing a challenge, to supporting each other arm in arm, and that\u2019s why sport has a critical role to play in not only supporting Australia right now, but also in our recovery and repair.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-492": {"text": "Council election results prove local politics is alive and well\nJohn Harris is absolutely right that political change is coming from a local level (Don\u2019t look to Westminster for new ideas \u2013 ask your councillor, 6 May).

If the results had only reflected Brexit-influenced trends then the Tories would have lost a handful of seats \u2013 but they lost 20, including both their council leader and chair.\nR4U is composed of people from a range of political backgrounds who are prepared to work together for the good of the area. The new administration now faces the daunting task of clearing up after the previous Tory administration: a deeply flawed local plan that has already been submitted for review by the planning inspectorate; an infrastructure agreement with Stansted airport that needs substantial rework; and speculative investments that need to be brought under control. Nobody said local government was easy but R4U have made a commitment to be open and transparent about the difficult decisions that have to be made, and the evidence that supports them, and to involve local people to the maximum degree possible in shaping their own future. These changes could be a model for a system that provides real checks and balances between central and local government, and removes the confrontational, partisan style of Westminster politics from the local arena.

Having spent more than 30 years as an activist in the ecology and the sustainability movement, the Green MEP for the south-west region feels the UK is finally starting to appreciate the scale of the climate emergency. \u201cPeople are suddenly waking up to it, which is very exciting for someone like me who\u2019s been banging on about this for years,\u201d she says.\nTake aviation. \u201cWe\u2019re really getting a grip on that now. That was something where I was really out of line with other people. But in the last year, people have stopped thinking that I\u2019m a loony not flying anywhere. They start by being admiring and then they start thinking \u2018Oh God, I\u2019m going to have to start doing that\u2019. We\u2019ve reached that point, it\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d\nHowever, Scott Cato, who is also the Green party\u2019s spokeswoman for EU relations, the economy and finance, and stopped flying in 2003, is exasperated at the government\u2019s stance on airport expansion. Barely a week after the prime minister declared a climate emergency, the government published detailed plans for a third runway at Heathrow. \u201cIt\u2019s really damaging if people just say this stuff and then carry on as usual. They must be committed to doing something, it mustn\u2019t just be hypocritical empty words.\u201d\nTackling climate change means we have to address the desperately unequal way both wealth and power are distributed\n\u201cThe positive side is that every time they come forward with a proposal, whether it\u2019s Heathrow, or another road-building scheme, we can say, \u2018Well, you said zero carbon by 2050, you said there was a climate emergency\u2019.\u201d\nShe strongly believes that reducing emissions is a crucial way to reduce inequality. \u201cThe crucial thing about the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is social justice. If you think about why people voted for Brexit, it\u2019s because they felt they were being left behind. Their resentment is being attached to climate denialism, by very irresponsible politicians who whip up resentment caused by austerity. They connect that and say \u2018Now you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t have my car\u2019. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying at all.\n\u201cWe have to have a more equal society. It\u2019s the wealthy who are causing climate change; 70% of flights are taken by the richest 15% of people. Tackling climate change means we have to address the desperately unequal way both wealth and power are distributed.\u201d\nScott Cato wants the UK, along with other industrialised countries, to take greater responsibility internationally. That means \u201cconstraining the ability of the wealthiest to escape the consequences of what they\u2019ve done to the planet with their greed. If you\u2019re talking about climate apartheid, you\u2019re talking about people in Bangladesh or the horn of Africa whose lives are being made impossible because of our historic emissions.\u201d\nSo what would she do? \u201cBecause we had the industrial revolution which caused the historic emissions that are now making their lives impossible, the least we can do is hand them the clean technologies we\u2019ve now got for free to recompense.\u201d\nScott Cato, 56, dates her ecological roots to her time at university in the mid-1980s. \u201cI didn\u2019t know in 1985 that there was such a political thing as a \u2018green\u2019,\u201d she says. But a Chilean friend saw that her politics was about natureand her connection to the Earth. \u201cEverywhere in the world there are greens, and what makes them green is the fact that your politics comes from this deep connection to planet Earth. It\u2019s an extraordinary feeling to know you\u2019re part of a global movement, that you\u2019re connected to the planet we all share.\u201d\nLater, in the 90s, she did an economics PhD (\u201cwhile struggling to feed three children until working families tax credits came along\u201d, she recalls), and then, in 2012, became the world\u2019s first professor of green economics at the University of Roehampton. This entailed thinking of the economy in terms both of society\u2019s place in the ecosystem, but also social justice, sustainable trade policy and welfare, she explains.\nIn addition to the economic arguments, Scott Cato says there are significant social justice advantages of a universal basic income. \u201cI think it\u2019s right that citizens have a stake in their society and should have security without having to sell their labour. Why should the wealthy have the freedom to develop their potential and the poor just get stuck on to a treadmill? It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nA member of the Green party since 1988, Scott Cato\u2019s political rise began in 2011, when she was elected a Green party councillor for Stroud district council. The following year she became group leader, and an electoral agreement led to a shared administration run by Labour, Greens and Liberal Democrats since 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s run cooperatively, but not in a formal coalition\u201d.\nThen, in 2014, Scott Cato surprised many by being elected a Green MEP. To win in the south-west required around 12% and the Greens were on around 6% nationally then, she recalls. But while the Lib Dems were traditionally strong in the south-west, the election came at the height of their unpopularity. \u201cIt was defecting Lib Dem voters that won me the seat, plus endless travelling everywhere and being seen to be everywhere,\u201d she admits.\nSo what does she think councils need to do to tackle the climate emergency? \u201cAll public buildings should have solar panels,\u201d she replies. In addition, she wants a national planning law to insist that all new buildings \u2013 residential and business \u2013 have to be zero-carbon or even net carbon negative by producing their own energy, and for local authorities to do more to enable people to work where they live. \u201cCommuting is an incredible waste of energy,\u201d she says. That means councils also need to do a lot more to promote community-supported agriculture. Why can\u2019t local authorities make more land available for local food growth schemes, she asks. And councils need to reverse cuts to bus services, to reduce the reliance on cars, she adds.\n\u201cTransport\u2019s appalling in Stroud. Because I don\u2019t have a car, my life ends at 6pm, and on Sunday I just have to enjoy my garden on my own. There are no buses in the evening. That\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s just saying to you \u2018Get a car\u2019 all the time.\u201d\nScott Cato is an unapologetic evangelist for the south-west and its sustainable credentials. \u201cTo me, the south-west is the deep-greeny part of the country,\u201d she says. \u201cTransition towns, that earthy-rooted green stuff has always come from the south-west. Real green politics is about connection to nature and why do some people choose to live in Bristol rather than London? Because they can get out to the countryside, why do they choose to live in Cornwall? Because they like that relationship with the sea.\n\u201cIf you look at the relationship between earnings and education, the south-west is full of very educated people who don\u2019t earn that much. That suggests people who have chosen lifestyle over more cash. That\u2019s a green life choice. If we\u2019re going to move to a green society where we have much more happiness and use much less energy and fewer resources, then we need to bottle whatever it is that makes people in the south-west happier with less money.\u201d\nAge: 56.\nFamily: Two sons, one daughter.\nEducation: Bath high school; St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford (politics, philosophy, economics); University of Wales, Aberystwyth (economics PhD).\nCareer: 2014-present: member, European parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs, and agriculture and rural development, committees; 2014-present: Green party member, South West Region, European parliament; 2013-14: chair, audit and standards committee, Stroud district council; 2012-14: professor, green economics, University of Roehampton; 2012-14: leader, Green group, Stroud district council; 2011-14: Green party councillor, Stroud district council; 2009-12: director, Transition Stroud; 2014: director, Stroud Common Wealth; 2007-12: director, Cardiff Institute for Cooperative Studies, Cardiff Metropolitan University; 2006-present: member, Stroud Community Agriculture cooperative; 2001-12: senior lecturer and reader in green economics, Cardiff Metropolitan University; 2000-01: tutor, Aberystwyth University; 1992-98: founder and director, Green Audit consultancy; 1990-2001: freelance copy editor, Oxford University Press; 1987-88: desk editor, Oxford University Press.\nInterests: Choral singing, basket-making, bodging, Quakerism.", "label": 0}, "text-494": {"text": "We have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, warns UN\nThe world\u2019s leading climate scientists have warned there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.\nThe authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on Monday say urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, which they say is affordable and feasible although it lies at the most ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5C and 2C.\nThe half-degree difference could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, according to the 1.5C study, which was launched after approval at a final plenary of all 195 countries in Incheon in South Korea that saw delegates hugging one another, with some in tears.\nA key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment.\nThe scientists found:\n\u2022 By\u00a02100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C.\n\u2022 Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C\n\u2022 Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds.\n\u2022 If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C\u00a0virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost\n\u201cIt\u2019s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now,\u201d said Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the working group on impacts. \u201cThis is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.\u201d\nPolicymakers commissioned the report at the Paris climate talks in 2016, but since then the gap between science and politics has widened. Donald Trump has promised to withdraw the US \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest source of historical emissions \u2013 from the accord. The first round of Brazil\u2019s presidential election on Sunday put Jair Bolsonaro into a strong position to carry out his threat to do the same and also open the Amazon rainforest to agribusiness.\nThe world is currently 1C warmer than preindustrial levels. Following devastating hurricanes in the US, record droughts in Cape Town and forest fires in the Arctic, the IPCC makes clear that climate change is already happening, upgraded its risk warning from previous reports, and warned that every fraction of additional warming would worsen the impact.\nScientists who reviewed the 6,000 works referenced in the report, said the change caused by just half a degree came as a revelation. \u201cWe can see there is a difference and it\u2019s substantial,\u201d Roberts said.\nAt 1.5C the proportion of the global population exposed to water stress could be 50% lower than at 2C, it notes. Food scarcity would be less of a problem and hundreds of millions fewer people, particularly in poor countries, would be at risk of climate-related poverty.\nAt 2C extremely hot days, such as those experienced in the northern hemisphere this summer, would become more severe and common, increasing heat-related deaths and causing more forest fires.\nBut the greatest difference would be to nature. Insects, which are vital for pollination of crops, and plants are almost twice as likely to lose half their habitat at 2C compared with 1.5C. Corals would be 99% lost at the higher of the two temperatures, but more than 10% have a chance of surviving if the lower target is reached.\nSea-level rise would affect 10 million more people by 2100 if the half-degree extra warming brought a forecast 10cm additional pressure on coastlines. The number affected would increase substantially in the following centuries due to locked-in ice melt.\nOceans are already suffering from elevated acidity and lower levels of oxygen as a result of climate change. One model shows marine fisheries would lose 3m tonnes at 2C, twice the decline at 1.5C.\nSea ice-free summers in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the world average, would come once every 100 years at 1.5C, but every 10 years with half a degree more of global warming.\nThe final tick box is political will\nTime and carbon budgets are running out. By mid-century, a shift to the lower goal would require a supercharged roll-back of emissions sources that have built up over the past 250 years.\nThe IPCC maps out four pathways to achieve 1.5C, with different combinations of land use and technological change. Reforestation is essential to all of them as are shifts to electric transport systems and greater adoption of carbon capture technology.\nCarbon pollution would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 \u2013 compared with a 20% cut under the 2C pathway \u2013 and come down to zero by 2050, compared with 2075 for 2C. This would require carbon prices that are three to four times higher than for a 2C target. But the costs of doing nothing would be far higher.\n\u201cWe have presented governments with pretty hard choices. We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C, and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that would be needed to achieve that,\u201d said Jim Skea, a co-chair of the working group on mitigation. \u201cWe show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will. We cannot answer that. Only our audience can \u2013 and that is the governments that receive it.\u201d\nHe said the main finding of his group was the need for urgency. Although unexpectedly good progress has been made in the adoption of renewable energy, deforestation for agriculture was turning a natural carbon sink into a source of emissions. Carbon capture and storage projects, which are essential for reducing emissions in the concrete and waste disposal industries, have also ground to a halt.\nReversing these trends is essential if the world has any chance of reaching 1.5C without relying on the untried technology of solar radiation modification and other forms of geo-engineering, which could have negative consequences.\nIn the run-up to the final week of negotiations, there were fears the text of the report would be watered down by the US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich countries that are reluctant to consider more ambitious cuts. The authors said nothing of substance was cut from a text.\nBob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said the final document was \u201cincredibly conservative\u201d because it did not mention the likely rise in climate-driven refugees or the danger of tipping points that could push the world on to an irreversible path of extreme warming.\nThe report will be presented to governments at the UN climate conference in Poland at the end of this year. But analysts say there is much work to be done, with even pro-Paris deal nations involved in fossil fuel extraction that runs against the spirit of their commitments. Britain is pushing ahead with gas fracking, Norway with oil exploration in the Arctic, and the German government wants to tear down Hambach forest to dig for coal.\nAt the current level of commitments, the world is on course for a disastrous 3C of warming. The report authors are refusing to accept defeat, believing the increasingly visible damage caused by climate change will shift opinion their way.\n\u201cI hope this can change the world,\u201d said Jiang Kejun of China\u2019s semi-governmental Energy Research Institute, who is one of the authors. \u201cTwo years ago, even I didn\u2019t believe 1.5C was possible but when I look at the options I have confidence it can be done. I want to use this report to do something big in China.\u201d\nThe timing was good, he said, because the Chinese government was drawing up a long-term plan for 2050 and there was more awareness among the population about the problem of rising temperatures. \u201cPeople in Beijing have never experienced so many hot days as this summer. It\u2019s made them talk more about climate change.\u201d\nRegardless of the US and Brazil, he said, China, Europe and major cities could push ahead. \u201cWe can set an example and show what can be done. This is more about technology than politics.\u201d\nJames Hansen, the former Nasa scientist who helped raised the alarm about climate change, said both 1.5C and 2C would take humanity into uncharted and dangerous territory because they were both well above the Holocene-era range in which human civilisation developed. But he said there was a huge difference between the two: \u201c1.5C gives young people and the next generation a fighting chance of getting back to the Holocene or close to it. That is probably necessary if we want to keep shorelines where they are and preserve our coastal cities.\u201d\nJohan Rockstr\u00f6m, a co-author of the recent Hothouse Earth report, said scientists never previously discussed 1.5C, which was initially seen as a political concession to small island states. But he said opinion had shifted in the past few years along with growing evidence of climate instability and the approach of tipping points that might push the world off a course that could be controlled by emissions reductions.\n\u201cClimate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThis report is really important.

Not the bunch currently scrapping in the World Cup, or the team that will face Australia later this summer, but the gaggle of richly talented amateurs united by two powerful things they have in common: sport and disability.\nDitching his prosthetic arm has liberated Matt Askin. He now flourishes his bat like a cheerleader\u2019s baton\n\u201cOur most improved player over the last couple of years,\u201d says Liam Thomas, the vice-captain of England\u2019s physical disability side, of the ball hitter, Matt Askin. Ditching his prosthetic arm has liberated Askin. He now flourishes his bat like a cheerleader\u2019s baton, larruping the ball further and faster than ever. \u201cHitting sixes with one hand, eh?\u201d adds Thomas. \u201cAmazing.\u201d\nTeachers, tilers, students, water workers and biscuit exporters by day, the men gathered here for a weekend training session are the elite among 60,000 people with disabilities playing cricket at one level or another.\nThere is a burgeoning range of sports for people with disabilities: the Paralympics is just the tip of the iceberg. From football \u2013 there are varieties for both frames and powerchairs \u2013 to wheelchair rugby, or blind and visually impaired tennis, disability sport is enjoying something of a boom. There is even table cricket: a specially adapted version of the game requiring no little skill, the national title of which was contested by more than 300 schools.\nRoughly one in five people in the UK report a disability and, according to a Sport England study in 2015-16, those who do are more than twice as likely to be physically inactive.\n\u201cA 26-year-old lad got in touch,\u201d said Neil Bradshaw, the operations manager for England disability cricket. \u201cHe was injured in service, is registered disabled and used to play for the army cricket team. He\u2019s not been confident enough to reach out previously. He\u2019s coming for a trial in August.\u201d\nAt the training session at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, everyone has a backstory \u2013 teenage bone cancer, amputation, club feet, missing limbs \u2013 but sympathy is neither sought nor required. Respect and a stage to perform on: that\u2019ll do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here. That and the chance to inspire the next generation to get involved.\nJoining the physically disabled elite at the weekend training camp are their counterparts from England\u2019s deaf squad. This innovative joint residential jaunt has been designed to bring together four sides \u2013 those with physical disability (PD), deafness, learning disability and visual impairment \u2013 under the overall disability umbrella.\nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nSizing each other up in open-net sessions lends proceedings a keen edge on the cusp of a pivotal season, for the PD group in particular. Later this summer, England stages the first physical disability world cricket series, duking it out with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe across nine days of T20 action in the West Midlands.\nThe hope is that exposure, and the seeing-is-believing nature of disability cricket, will help achieve what the likes of Anya Shrubsole and Steph Houghton have done for women\u2019s sport. There are, as yet unconfirmed, plans to stream the games live. Millions would watch on the subcontinent. India\u2019s involvement, backed by the all-powerful cricket authorities there, could be a gamechanger.\n\u201cThe number of blind cricketers alone in India would drown the number of visually impaired athletes in Paralympic programmes across the world,\u201d says Ian Martin, the head of disability cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board. \u201cAnd I think people often miss cricket\u2019s appeal to people with all disabilities \u2013 we aim to include, not exclude. At grassroots level, we can be proud to say we welcome anyone.\u201d\nMartin appreciates the game\u2019s potential reach so keenly because the story is also autobiographical. A lifelong and passionate club cricketer diagnosed with the muscle- and nerve-wasting condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, he has singlemindedly pushed the disabled game forward over the past decade.\n\u201cWhen I pull on my suit and look at the three lions on it, I\u2019m able to think back to the dreams that I had as a kid about representing England at cricket and realise that I\u2019ve achieved the dream and then some, just not in the way that I planned.\u201d\nThis summer is a watershed for Martin and Bradshaw, both backroom veterans. Martin brokered the first PD international, between England and Pakistan in 2012. Bradshaw, who knits logistics together across the board, finally gave up his Matalan warehouse shift manager\u2019s gig to go full-time last year. His initial involvement, a decade back in Cheshire, was done as a favour. \u201cI got into it simply because I fancied a pint at a cricket club,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI saw 10-12 disabled kids running their own warm-up, so just started helping out.\u201d\nMartin and Bradshaw are a tight partnership despite a bitter footballing rivalry (one is Everton, the other Liverpool). They have hundreds of shared miles under their belts building patiently for this moment. As Bradshaw sees it, fate just dealt these cricketers a different path: his remit is to push the envelope in search of validity.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where our frustration lies,\u201d he says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sympathy setup because these lads can\u2019t get access to their cricket anywhere else. The standard\u2019s really high.\n\u201cIt\u2019s educating people \u2013 getting away from the \u2018oh, bless them, isn\u2019t that nice?\u2019 attitude. People don\u2019t understand the game until they\u2019ve seen the game.\u201d\nWatching the training underscores his point: there is serious ability here, as evidenced when left-hander Thomas nails a succession of sweet shots against a bowling machine, deploying immaculate footwork. (His right leg ends just below the knee.)\nThe coaching staff comprises ex-England Test cricketers Ian Salisbury and James Kirtley. The performance analyst, Chris Highton, is on hand to crunch the numbers and go through footage. Muscles and tweaks are tended by Scott Gormley and Richard Olejar, the latter physio a quietly spoken Slovakian taekwondo international known as \u201cthe assassin\u201d for reasons that later become clear.\nAfter a couple of hours power-hitting in front of the bowling machines, there is a performance analysis seminar with Highton, who urges the players to embrace the data and make it work for them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making strengths super-strengths and weaknesses strengths,\u201d he says. Then it\u2019s down to the nitty gritty: batters v bowlers in a series of T20 scenarios. Fielding and catching drills complete the afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d\nThe competitive instinct kicks in when the different teams come together to test out their skills. There is an eye-catching exchange when deaf fast bowler George Greenway, capable of whistling it down at almost 80mph, takes on Liam O\u2019Brien, who is not given to taking backward steps.\n\u201cMake sure you say he didn\u2019t get me out,\u201d he says of the tussle. He\u2019s only half joking.\nHonesty, friendship and integrity, winning on and off the pitch: these are constantly recurring themes across the weekend. Saturday evening is spent at the campus bar enjoying a couple of well-earned drinks, during which the squads start to mingle. Salisbury doesn\u2019t bang the drum about curfews. He doesn\u2019t have to: several of the players retreat to their digs before last orders.\nSunday morning brings the opportunity to discover first-hand why Olejar has his nickname. Breakfast is at 7.45am. At 9am sharp, both squads \u2013 and, at Salisbury\u2019s insistence, your 50-year-old correspondent \u2013 warm up with Olejar. For 45 minutes, we are put through a series of hops and/or leaps up one, two, and then three steps. The theme to Rocky blares out as we pound the concrete.Then it\u2019s rigorous stretching inside before getting down to work again.\nBy about 4pm we are done. Everyone goes their separate ways, back to the day jobs. There is a wistful, end-of-school-term air as the players drift off. Liam O\u2019Brien and spinner Fred Bridges plot their podcast listening on the journey back to Sussex.\nDan Hamm, joker in the pack, alights upon Askin\u2019s discarded prosthesis. \u201cLook!\u201d he says, waving it like a triumphant detective cracking a case, \u201cwe\u2019ve found this \u2013 which must mean\u2026 there\u2019s a body somewhere!\u201d Askin, clearly familiar with this sketch, smiles and shrugs his shoulders.\nI mention that time has raced by: 48 hours gone in five minutes. \u201cYeah,\u201d Askin concurs, smiling broadly. \u201cI never want to go home.\u201d\n\u2022 A version of this article appeared in Wisden cricket monthly", "label": 0}, "text-496": {"text": "Advance Australia?

A bare majority say they are taking notice of federal politics, with just 15% professing to follow events closely. That leaves half the population either wholly or partly disengaged.\nAnd a personal confession: despite my day job, I am one of them. For the past three months it has been a punish to engage in the news without contemplating the parallel universe where a Labor government was rolling out an ambitious, progressive agenda.\nI think it\u2019s no surprise that the lack of interest in politics is particularly strong among younger voters who had the most at stake from the outcome.\nThis disengagement is matched with low expectations for the next term of government, with just 12% believing the Morrison government will make a large positive difference to Australia.\nOn the converse, similarly low numbers think they will do any real damage; the vast majority feel we will simply tread water somewhere off Meh-roubra.\nThe politics of meh is not confined to the federal arena \u2013 respondents have similar low interest levels about international affairs, state politics, local issues.\nWhile there is some, albeit limited, passion around the footy finals, we profess to even lower levels of engagement with the staples of reality TV (which will come as a surprise to those who pour millions into advertising on them).

The government has made a series of pledges to reduce workload, but teachers say they are yet to reap the benefits.\nAccording to the report, a third of new teaching recruits leave the job within the first five years. The paper also quotes recent Department for Education (DfE) research, which found that \u201csleeping problems, panic attacks and anxiety issues\u201d had contributed to teachers\u2019 decisions to quit the profession.\nThe lead author of the report, John Jerrim, a professor at the UCL institute of education, said: \u201cThe teaching profession in England is currently in the midst of a crisis and one potential reason why it\u2019s struggling to recruit and retain enough teachers is due to the pressures of the job.\n\u201cIt has long been known that teaching is a stressful and challenging career and we wanted to see if the mental health and wellbeing of teachers had improved or declined, especially in light of government promises to ease the burden upon the teaching profession.\u201d\nThe report concedes that the increase in reported mental health problems is not specific to education, but can be seen in other professions, including those working in human resources and accountancy which may be due to an increased willingness to discuss mental illness and seek help.\nIt concludes: \u201cIn our view, the most pressing issue is for the DfE to make a commitment to monitor the mental health and wellbeing of the teaching profession \u2013 similar to the commitment it has made to monitoring teachers\u2019 workloads over time.\u201d\nSin\u00e9ad Mc Brearty, the chief executive of Education Support, the UK\u2019s mental health and wellbeing charity for education staff, said work-related anxiety and depression were high in education.\n\u201cThe sharp rise in teachers reporting long-term mental health conditions mirrors the increase in the severity of cases that we support through our counselling helpline. Teachers are presenting with ever more severe mental health symptoms.\u201d\nDr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was no wonder schools were unable to recruit and retain staff when workload demands continued to be unsustainable. \u201cThe challenge for the government is to address these issues and ensure that education staff are nurtured and supported in their role but there is currently little sign of any concrete action in this respect.\u201d\nA DfE spokesperson said action was already under way to improve work-life balance for teachers. \u201cThis includes reducing workload, supporting early career schoolteachers, promoting flexible working and tackling accountability pressures, as well as supporting schools to deal with behaviour management.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-498": {"text": "What Happened? by Hanif Kureishi \u2013 review\nUnlike Hillary Clinton, who used the same title for her memoir, Hanif Kureishi attaches a question mark to What Happened?, making clear that this collection of essays and stories is an interrogation of the recent past and not merely a dispassionate account of events. There is a note of incredulity, too, in his question, and this desire to comprehend and come to terms with the cultural and political shifts of the past decade runs through the book.\nWhat Happened? serves as a postscript to Kureishi\u2019s Collected Essays, published in 2011, which brought together the best of his journalism and nonfiction over the previous three decades. Many of the pieces here revisit similar themes and preoccupations, particularly around ideas of race, religion and cultural identity. Why Should We Do What God Says? and Fanatics, Fundamentalists and Fascists cast an eye back to the 1989 fatwa against his friend Salman Rushdie, and the far-reaching ripples of that event for free speech, the western perception of Islam, and the hardening and polarising of ideologies. \u201cThe contemporary view of Muslims is the mirror image of the current far-right ideology overtaking the west: sexist, homophobic, insular, monocultural, combative,\u201d he writes in the latter piece, before calling for a different kind of radicalism among the young, a movement of solidarity to tackle the creeping fascism and fearful power-grabbing of their elders. \u201cThe formerly excluded and deterritorialised could become an organised class of enlightened, educated young people prepared to join with others across Europe to struggle for freedom, equality and social change.\u201d This is exactly the kind of unifying cause embodied by the recent climate movement, though he doesn\u2019t mention it; one of the greatest frustrations of the book \u2013 a fault it shares with the Collected Essays \u2013 is that the pieces are not dated. It would have been interesting to follow the evolution of his ideas, or to place them in a more precise context.\nThis would be particularly useful where essays are responses to specific events. We Are the Pollutants addresses Penguin Books\u2019 public commitment to greater diversity, and looks back at the battles he had to fight in his own career across publishing, film and television, industries \u201cmore or less entirely dominated by white Oxbridge men\u201d. Here Kureishi identifies firmly with those whose voices have been excluded, talking throughout of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d (one TV producer early in his career told him \u201cif [your characters] were white, we\u2019d make this\u201d). This claim to outsider status is somewhat undermined by subsequent pieces that begin: \u201cOne night, my friend Stephen Frears and I went on a boat trip down the Bosphorus with about a dozen models\u2026\u201d; or \u201cOne of the first and most important pieces of advice David Bowie ever gave me\u2026\u201d\nThere\u2019s a deliberate, tongue-in-cheek self-satirising to the name-dropping, obviously, and the pieces collected here reflect Kureishi\u2019s sharp eye for multiple perspectives born of his own experience, whether he is discussing Antigone, Freud or Mad Men. But perhaps most memorable are the few short stories scattered throughout, in particular She Said He Said, a portrait of two marriages and a shift in sexual politics, deftly captured in a few short pages with all the author\u2019s customary comedy and sympathy.\n\u2022 What Happened? by Hanif Kureishi is published by Faber (\u00a316.99).

They are set to rise by 30 per cent and, according to UN Environment, bring 3.0-3.2\u00b0C increase by the end of the century. Frustrating the doomsters, however, Hadley Centre data (but not that of UAH) indicates temperature levels fell back to their long term norm in September.\nIn a further blow to the alarmists, Anthony Watts reports Warmista Gavin Schmidt has been forecasting ever higher oceanic temperatures. But the data shows all measures dipping below 2015 levels.\nEnergy policy developments: Global\nPrepared by a staff of 34 and assisted by dozens of consultations, the messianic International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) new report on energy in South East Asia (excludes China and India) estimates that under current policies fossil fuels, presently at 77 per cent of supply, will rise to 79 per cent. Under its preferred \u201csustainable development scenario\u201d of subsidies and regulations the fossil fuel share would fall to 59 per cent. For electricity, under business-as-usual IEA forecasts coal would supply 50 per cent with wind/solar at 3 per cent; under the \u201csustainable development scenario\u201d coal would be 6 per cent and wind/solar 24 per cent.\nThe World Bank is a far more powerful institution than the IEA but with Barack Obama nominated Jim Yong Kim as its president, its emphasis has switched from lifting the world's poor out of poverty to prioritising 'environmental sustainability', not least by banning investment in cheap, reliable fossil fuel power sources. Jim Yong Kim got a second five year term in September 2016.\nEnergy policy developments: North America\nThe repeal proposal for the Obama Clean Power Plan asserts that the US would save $33 billion by not complying with the regulation and rejects the health benefits the Obama administration had calculated from the original rule.\nMichael Bloomberg is unimpressed and has announced a further funding of $64 million to support the Sierra Club's \"Beyond Coal\" campaign and other organizations to help move the United States off of coal power altogether.\nThe Canadian government is requiring the provinces to set a carbon tax starting at $10 per tonne and rising to $50 per tonne by 2022. Stating this as excessive, Manitoba has set a tax at $25 per tonne on coal, gas and petrol which it says will cost the average family $356 per year.\nEnergy policy developments: Australia\nTony Abbott\u2019s London address to the Global Warming Policy Foundation had immediate effects in modifying the previous agenda calling for more renewable subsidies into one that is calling for their halt when the current program finishes in 2020 and requiring retailers contracting for intermittent generation to have \u201cfirming\u201d power insurance. Australia's Government naturally said the two events were unrelated.\nThe Australian policy changed in response to a recognition of the inconsistencies between more renewable subsidies and cheaper power, which I addressed here and here. The new policy waters down the proposal to shift to 42 per cent renewables. It seems to cap the subsidised renewables at 16 per cent of supply by 2020 (the 23 per cent renewable share includes 7 per cent commercial hydro). But, confusingly, the government is also talking of a 26-34 per cent share by 2030. The policy also requires retailers to ensure specific shares of \u201cdespatchable\u201d power but the meaning of this is unclear as it could cover batteries immediately available for 5 minutes or gas available within 10 minutes but then in use for hours.\nDoubtless a factor conditioning Australian policy is voter opinions. In a recent survey, a majority of respondents said they would prefer to abandon the Paris Accord in light of US departure, if this were to result in cheaper electricity. However as many as 40 per cent said they would prefer to pay more.\nRenewable energy propagandists claim that wind is now competitive with coal. But, following the Australian government decision not to subsidise additional renewables post 2020, Deutsche Bank has downgraded value of renewables formerly in the pipeline placing no value to undeveloped pipeline of more than 1500MW of wind projects and 140MW of solar projects in Australia showing investors consider that renewables cannot compete without subsidies, a view the industry lobby group seems to accept.\nClimate politics\nPerpetually tanned French lawyer-politician, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has warned. \u201cwe will be toasted, roasted and grilled\u201d if the world fails to take \u201ccritical decisions\u201d on climate change.\nMoonbeam Californian Governor Brown is taking Trump to court to try to prevent his reversal of the Obama greenhouse mitigating measures .

Seven Portuguese children are going further and suing the EU for the effects climate change are having on their lives, and they are joined by 21 plaintiffs who are going to sue President Trump (no stories yet of a more meaningful lawsuit, one that seeks damages for the adverse effects these policies have on future living standards!). And with no sense of irony, Patti Smith is leading a coterie of jet-setting performers in a Paris protest concert to combat backsliding on the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nTrump was unimpressed by this fervour and nominated as White House senior adviser for environmental policy, Kathleen Hartnett White, who has described the belief in \"global warming\" as a \"kind of paganism\" for \"secular elites\". EPA Director Scott Pruitt is equally unperturbed and has disowned a 2009 paper from his agency suggesting there were dangers of climate change.\nUnfortunately Trump has however adopted \u201cswamp like\u201d policies by maintaining the subsidies to ethanol for gasoline to pander to vested interests especially in Iowa.\nIt is said that an estimated 1.9 million U.S. homes could be flooded by 2100 if seas rise 6 feet in response to climate change according to a US real estate business.

As Andrew Montford points out \u201cthe BBC didn\u2019t apologise for allowing Al Gore to utter his wild claims about the climate in the same Today programme segment, why they never challenge the absurd statements greens make about fracking (indeed BBC journalists were at the forefront of disseminating them)\u201d. Lord Lawson\u2019s view is shared by over 400 peer reviewed papers published in this year alone.\nAustralian governments expropriated rural land expropriation for emission reduction purposes. A conservative government in Queensland reversed this and the left wing government now seeking re-election has plans to reimpose it claiming, \u201cSome 45 million tonnes of emissions is generated in Queensland alone by land clearing.

Just like Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth sequel, \"Truth to Power\", it failed to resonate with viewers. Alarmists clearly need to reinvigorate their cause.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s so urgent that we identify who is vulnerable so we can put measures in place.\u201d\nBut he cautioned that, while much of the support offered was likely to be digital while physical distancing continues, we must still ensure those interventions have been properly trialled: \u201cOne of my concerns is that in our rush to be supportive there\u2019s this widespread rollout of digital technologies that are not evidence-based.\u201d\nThe survey of 3,077 UK adults recruited according to age, sex and socioeconomic background is being led by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Samaritans and the Scottish Association for Mental Health.\nThe survey is exploring new territory, O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWe know from research into Sars in China that there can be a mental health impact, but we don\u2019t know who is likely to be affected.\u201d\nWith interim findings expected in the next few weeks, O\u2019Connor is hopeful that researchers can gain an impression of the impact of lockdown, along with indications about the groups of people who need immediate support.\nCentral to this, said O\u2019Connor, was understanding what the factors are that predict feelings of loneliness and entrapment in some people but not others.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between people who are socially isolated and do feel lonely, and those who don\u2019t? If you look at the research on loneliness, it is such a strong predictor of death by physical causes as well as death by suicide.\n\u201cAnother factor to understand is that of entrapment. People feel trapped by mental pain, but in this current context they are feeling physical entrapment. What is the interface between lockdown measures and psychological entrapment? Again, we know entrapment is such an important predictor of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviour.\u201d\nAs regards entrapment, for example, participants will be asked to rate on a sliding scale the extent to which the statements relate to them, such as \u201cI feel powerless to change things\u201d and \u201cI feel trapped inside myself\u201d.\nThe respondents will be surveyed six times over six months, completing a range of questions covering their background, living arrangements, lifestyle factors such as drinking and exercise, mental health and wellbeing, their experience of Covid-19, financial issues, as well as any pre-existing health problems. They will also be asked about feelings of entrapment, loneliness and other psychological variables.\nO\u2019Connor was one of a group of experts who wrote in the journal Lancet Psychiatry last week highlighting the need for a thorough and coordinated programme of research into the potentially profound and long-lasting impact of both the virus itself and the experience of lockdown and other measures on the population\u2019s mental health.\nWhile the team will have a much clearer picture after six months, O\u2019Connor is certain that the economic consequences, already felt by so many, will have a significant effect. \u201cOur feeling is, if there is an impact, it will be much longer term: there will be a short-term impact, but it will really be when the economic consequences kick in.\n\u201cWe know this will have a disproportionate effect on people who are already vulnerable \u2013 that could be having pre-existing mental health problems, but it could also mean those who are feeling trapped, or those experiencing financial hardship. Now we are trying to get a sense of who we need to identify and then how they can best be protected.\u201d\n\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org.

funding should be denied on the basis that applicants had obtained funding from other sources, including other Australian government grants programs, and state and territory funding.\nIt noted that some projects that received Australian government funding from other sources got sports grants as well, and that \u201cdeclining to fund projects on the basis that they had secured additional state or territory funding was inconsistent\u201d with the program\u2019s guidelines, which encouraged co-contributions.\nThe ANAO also noted that eight projects were potentially ineligible because they were completed by the time funding agreements were executed by Sport Australia, a situation which \u201csuggests that \u2026 those selected for funding under the program may not have required Australian government funding in order to deliver their projects\u201d.\nIn August 2018 the Liberal state MP Anthony Roberts announced $1m towards a proposed redevelopment of Boronia Park, in the federal

Park.\nFederal Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman is an honorary patron of the club and has advocated for the upgrade, although he insists the club took the lead in applying for federal funds.\nThe draft plan

of high temperature records were broken in the UK in 2019 as a consequence of the climate crisis, the Met Office has said.\nThe hottest temperature ever recorded in the UK was exceeded on 25 July in Cambridge, where the thermometer hit 38.7C (101F). The record for the hottest February day was also broken, with Kew Gardens in London recording 21.2C on the 26th.\nThe hottest December day is also likely to have been exceeded when 18.7C was recorded at Achfary in the Scottish Highlands on the 28th, but this is awaiting verification. The Highlands also recorded the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in February \u2013 of 13.9C at Achnagart.\nEight high temperature records were broken in the last decades, but only one for a low temperature. That was for the lowest maximum temperature for a March day, when Tredegar in Wales never got warmer than -4.7C on 1 March 2018 during the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d weather event.\n\u201cIt is notable how many of these extreme records have been set in the most recent decade and how many more of them are reflecting high rather than low-temperature extremes, a consequence of our warming climate,\u201d said Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office\u2019s national climate information centre.\nThe UK\u2019s weather is particularly variable because of the competing influences of the Atlantic Ocean and continental Europe. This means that low temperature records can still be set even as the average temperature rises due to global heating.\nGlobally, 2019 is expected to be the second or third hottest year since 1850. It was the hottest ever in Australia, where huge wildfires are burning, and in Russia. The global average temperature for the last decade is also expected to be the highest recorded, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\nIn the UK, 2019 was the 11th hottest year recorded, but 11 hottest years have occurred since 2002.\nThe UK climate is warming, the Met Office said, but this does not mean every decade will be significantly warmer than the one preceding it. The 2010s were the second hottest and second wettest decade in 100 years, slightly behind the 2000s. This is partly the result of a cold year in 2010, but the Met Office said such years occur much less frequently now than in the past.\nThe coming year is a significant one for action to fight the climate emergency, with the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and many others urging nations to dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions. The UK government will host a key UN summit in Glasgow in November.\nA recent comprehensive expert analysis concluded that the world was on a path to climate disaster, with three-quarters of the commitments countries made under the 2015 Paris climate agreement rated as \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d. Nations agreed to limit global heating to 2C above pre-industrial levels, or 1.5C if possible. Each country made a voluntary pledge of climate action, but to date these would result in global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2020 to re-insert words which had been inadvertently removed during the editing process.", "label": 0}, "text-503": {"text": "Peachy: the emoji that\u2019s become a political statement\nName: Peach emoji.\nAge: Up to 6,000 years old.\nThey had emojis 6,000 years ago?

Well, cuneiform sometimes used symbols that stood for multiple words or concepts.

Here are the teams that we think did the best and worst jobs of improving their future.\nBaltimore Ravens: Baltimore didn\u2019t have many needs after winning 14 games in 2019, but general manager Eric DeCosta and head coach John Harbaugh maximized their positioning during the draft\u2019s first two days.\nAfter losing linebackers Patrick Onwuasor and Josh Bynes in free agency, the Ravens tapped rangy LSU linebacker Patrick Queen with their first pick (28th overall). Queen is undersized for the position, but possesses blistering sideline-to-sideline speed and strong pass coverage abilities. After Queen, Baltimore added Ohio State running back JK Dobbins, an exciting addition to Baltimore\u2019s record-breaking rushing attack who should effectively spell 30-year-old starter Mark Ingram and backup Gus Edwards.\nInstead of Queen or Dobbins, it was third-round pick Justin Madubuike that excited draft analysts the most. Some experts thought the brawny Texas A&M defensive tackle would go early in the second round, but he instead fell to Baltimore at pick No 71. When asked what his favorite part of playing football is, Madubuike told USA Today \u201cI love putting my hand in somebody\u2019s throat and pushing them all the way backward.\u201d Add in fellow third-round pick Devin Duvernay, who logged 106 catches and nine touchdown receptions last year at Texas, and the Ravens left the 2020 draft looking like the biggest winners.\nDallas Cowboys: The question that vexes every team when drafting is whether you select the best player available or the player that fits your biggest need. The Cowboys entered the draft with one of the league\u2019s most loaded offenses but still spent their first-round pick on Oklahoma wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, one of three standout receivers in the 2020 class. Dallas had more glaring needs at defensive back and defensive line, but wily owner and team president Jerry Jones decided on Lamb, who has the explosiveness, strength and route precision of a future superstar.\nThe gamble on Lamb may be worth it after Dallas unexpectedly landed Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs in the second round. Diggs is a former receiver who converted to defensive back and excelled in 2019 with three interceptions, 11 pass breakups and is a player many scouts considered a first-round talent. Third-round pick Neville Gallimore is a mammoth interior defensive lineman that Dallas may have lucked into at pick No82 and fourth-round cornerback Reggie Robinson gives them depth at one of their weakest positions.\nIndianapolis Colts: The Colts drafted some of the best players available and filled some of their biggest needs even without a first-round pick. Second-round pick Michael Pittman is one of the many stud receivers of this draft class; the USC product is a sturdy 6ft 4in with excellent hands and enough speed to become the Colts\u2019 top receiver within the next few seasons. Running back Jonathan Taylor is one of the most successful college players of all-time \u2013 he became the first player in NCAA history to rush for over 6,000 yards in a three-year span \u2013 and possesses the strength and field vision consistent with the NFL\u2019s most successful running backs. There is some concern about the amount of carries he took in college and whether that will hurt his durability, but his explosiveness and physicality give him one of the highest ceilings of any skill player in the draft.\nFifth-round selection Jacob Eason certainly looks the part of a future NFL starting quarterback \u2013 the Washington product stands 6ft 6in and has excellent arm strength \u2013 but must overcome the streaky tendencies that affected his 2019 season. He won\u2019t play next year, but head coach Frank Reich may work to groom him as Indianapolis\u2019s future starting QB.\nGreen Bay Packers: It\u2019s impossible to anoint any true \u201closers\u201d before the drafted players begin their NFL careers, but Green Bay\u2019s selections were extremely confusing for a team looking to win a title while the 36-year-old Aaron Rodgers is still one of the game\u2019s best players. Widely expected to pick one of the many elite receivers in the draft, general manager Brian Gutekunst instead traded up from pick No 30 to select Utah State QB Jordan Love, who the team presumably expect to replace Rodgers in two or three years. \nIn the second round, Gutekunst and coach Matt LaFleur drafted bruising running back AJ Dillon even though the Packers already have two proven rushers in Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams. Perhaps the front office expects Jones and Williams to leave town once they become free agents after next season, but it was still odd to see Green Bay spend their top two picks on positions they didn\u2019t need to address.\nAny angry Packers fan should read this 2012 assessment of the Seattle Seahawks draft\u2013 one that calls Russell Wilson \u201cthe worst pick in the entire draft\u201d \u2013 before declaring this draft a failure. Even so, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a player besides third-round tight end Josiah Deguara who looks primed to make an impact in 2020.\nLas Vegas Raiders: The Raiders maintained their eccentric draft-day tendencies with a host of confusing selections despite holding two first-round picks. Speedy Alabama receiver Henry Ruggs was one of the three elite players at the position (along with Lamb and Jerry Jeudy) but considered the least polished of the three. It was a forgivable selection, but few thought that Ruggs would be the first of a historically deep receiver class off the board.\nIt was eight picks after Ruggs when the Raiders stumped anybody who follows the draft: defensive back Damon Arnette was a strong defender on a loaded Ohio State defense, but most draftniks didn\u2019t have him as a first-round player. Time will tell if Arnette becomes one of the better players on the Raiders secondary, but Mayock probably could have traded the 19th overall pick and stockpiled assets instead of spending it on a player nobody valued highly.\nWhile the Raiders are always one of the most entertaining teams to follow on draft day, their inconsistency remains the only consistent thing about them.\nDenver Broncos: Team president John Elway clearly wanted to supply new starting quarterback Drew Lock with weapons, which explains his selection of receivers Jerry Jeudy and KJ Hamler with Denver\u2019s first two picks. The problem is that he didn\u2019t do much to assure that Lock will be properly protected and given adequate time to get the ball to his new studs.

Productivity is lower than the rest of the UK and more of its working age people have no formal qualifications than the national average.\nIn the last 15 years there has been considerable migration from eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, joining longer established British Asian groups that make up almost 12% of the population, above the average of almost 8% for England.

Researchers found that if little is done to constrain greenhouse gas emissions and the world warms by 3C to 4C this century then hurricane rainfall could increase by a third, while wind speeds would be boosted by as much as 25 knots.\n\u201cClimate change has exacerbated rainfall and is set to enhance the wind speed,\u201d said Christina Patricola, who undertook the study with her Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory colleague Michael Wehner. \u201cMy hope is that this information can be used to improve our resilience to the kinds of extreme weather events we are going to have in the future.\u201d\nThe research, published in the journal Nature, used climate models to see how factors such as air and ocean temperatures have influenced hurricanes. Projections into the future were then made, based upon various levels of planetary warming.\nThe findings suggest that enormously destructive storms have already been bolstered by climate change and similar events in the future are on course to be cataclysmic.\nIn a world where temperatures were 3C warmer on average, Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in nearly 2,000 deaths when levees breached near New Orleans in 2005, would\u2019ve been even worse, with around 25% more rainfall. Cyclone Yasi, which hit Australia in 2011, would have had around a third more rain, while the deluge during Gafilo, a huge storm that killed more than 300 people in Madagascar in 2004, would have been 40% more intense.\nJennifer Francis, a hurricane expert at Rutgers University, said: \u201cThis study adds exclamation points to the already clear message that we must slow global warming by conserving energy and switching from fossil to renewable fuels while preparing for more extreme weather to come.\u201d\nHurricanes, or cyclones as they are known in the Pacific region, draw their strength from warmth in the upper layers of the ocean, while their rainfall is influenced by the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. Climate change, driven by human activity, is creating more favorable conditions for stronger hurricanes, with recent research finding that storms are intensifying more rapidly than they were 30 years ago.\nLast year was the costliest hurricane season on record for the US, with $306.2bn in damage caused by a trio of category four storms \u2013 Harvey, Irma and Maria \u2013 which, respectively, drowned parts of Houston, rattled most of Florida, and decimated Puerto Rico.

The rise of movements for abortion rights, Open Stadiums in Iran and the USWNT fight for equal pay \u2013 not to mention like MeToo \u2013 have helped accelerate the pace of change. Where layers of society are reflecting on the role of women and how they are treated and represented, so too is the business which visually documents the workings of society.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening across all imagery, in advertising, in fashion, in other kind of media spaces, is this diversification of what beauty is, a diversification of what is attractive,\u201d says Swift. \u201cWomen\u2019s sport was seen as unattractive. Women\u2019s rugby players were seen as unfeminine, and so there was this natural aversion to focusing on them as athletes.\n\u201cI think back to my childhood, and even in my 20s, the players that you saw a lot of were the leggy, blonde, ponytailed tennis players. Then we had people like Tessa Sanderson coming through, who was always criticised for being too manly, and it\u2019s only more recently that we appreciate athletes bodies are the shape they are because of the work that they put in.\nWomen can be as equally as inspired and aspire to be that as being this beautiful model with a tennis racket in their hand. With the beauty industry really looking at itself, hopefully we\u2019ll see that as the visualisation industry shifts that sport will get sucked up into it too.\u201d\nThough change is happening, it is slow, seen by the fuss and anger caused by two of Swifts 10 images of the year - Megan Rapinoe\u2019s celebration and Alex Morgan\u2019s tea sipping. \u201cThere was a lot of commentary around it being not a feminine way to celebrate, somehow it\u2019s arrogant,\u201d says Swift. \u201cBut then you look at the way men celebrate, with stupid robot dances and all that kind of stuff. What the controversy has done though is make it an iconic image,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we need to create more of those so that the the younger generations, as they go about their lives, have those lodged in their memories so that they think about sport and the power of sport for women as iconic and aspirational.\u201d\nIncreasingly there is recognition of the power the media can play in building up women\u2019s sport, in particular football, in the same mutually-beneficial way it has men\u2019s sports, and that attitude has filtered into photography. A big part of trying to change things is a drive to bring more women sports photographers to the fore. Getty hired two women photographers on internships who are covering the women\u2019s game around the country. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we\u2019re annexing female photographers in the female game, but it\u2019s giving them the opportunity to grow with a growing game,\u201d adds Swift.\nThe decision to take on two together felt important, too. \u201cYou go to games, you know how much abuse a poor female photographer gets,\u201d Swift adds. \u201cSo giving them the power of being able to stick together was very important.\u201c\nSome of the biggest barriers faced by women photographers are faced my many other women workers in freelance and casual industries \u2013 antisocial hours, tough conditions and prohibitively expensive equipment. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a solution that we can all say \u2018oh, if we do that, then things will change.\u2019 But it\u2019s it\u2019s those little decisions we make along the way that matter,\u201d says Swift. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one because that that\u2019s exactly what we get told is that female photographers get to the point where they can\u2019t be bothered with the hassle of it and go on and do something else, and it\u2019s those things have to be looked at in more detail.\u201d\nThe effects of having female photographers following female athletes is not something very measurable, but Swift is hopeful that a more representative industry will throw up different, closer coverage. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell right now what our female sports photographers bring to an image versus our male photographer because they are equally as good, they are all highly skilled photographers. But I suspect over time, we will see a difference in the reactions to a male of a certain age coming in and taking photographs to women coming in.\n\u201cI suspect that these female sports photographers are going to be able to get into the locker room and into those spaces that maybe a man couldn\u2019t and and that\u2019s going to then affect the stories that we tell around women\u2019s sport too.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-513": {"text": "arguments for and against the hypothesis that humans cause global warming\nThe inauguration on 20 January 2017 of new American President Donald Trump will be sure to introduce new investigations into the integrity of the received hypothesis that humans can or do raise the global temperature to dangerous levels (aka 'climate change').

The government hopes to hash out deals with both the EU and the United States by the end of the year, when the transition period ends and Britain is no longer bound to Europe\u2019s rules.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious goal, but not impossible. President Trump is \u201cbullish\u201d on a UK deal, the American ambassador Woody Johnson recently said, adding that Trump, like the prime minister, wants to \u201cget it done\u201d. They make it sound so easy. And it\u2019s true that Donald Trump has so far favoured quick and dirty deals with individual countries over complex, multinational agreements. But trade negotiations will also mean facing the world\u2019s largest economy at the bargaining table alone, with little leverage and a ticking clock. The US will push aggressively against anything that blocks American companies from doing business here, and there are few things on which the two countries are more divided than climate policy.\nThe UK has ambitious plans to decarbonise by 2050, while the US has little policy and no targets to speak of. So the government will struggle to come to an agreement without sacrificing its already fragile climate commitments. Trade deals are increasingly about the alignment (a very EU-ey word) of standards and regulations to allow foreign goods and services into our borders. And it won\u2019t surprise anyone to learn that alignment with the US rarely leads to stronger regulation; instead, trade agreements often act as a powerful and undemocratic tool to erode or supersede existing protections.\nThe common example is the fear of poorly checked, chlorine-washed American chicken being sold in the UK. But the gulf between the US and UK on climate is even larger than on food standards. Documents from a 2018 meeting, leaked in November, set out a harsh starting position: the US will not discuss the climate crisis or include the term in any deal, which means it won\u2019t consider existing climate policies legitimate grounds for opposition to any of its demands.\nThis suggests the American negotiators will push to weaken existing low-carbon standards, or worse \u2013 given the UK has many climate targets but little actual concrete policy as yet \u2013 lock in clauses favourable to the fossil fuel industry that can\u2019t be easily overturned by domestic legislation. This would effectively head off climate policy before it can be written. A similar thing played out before negotiations when the UK was part of the EU: in the now stalled Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the US pushed for wording that would prevent initiatives to help renewables compete with fossil fuels. That demand is likely to be repeated, with the American fossil fuel industry keen to get fracked gas as well as oil from tar sands into the UK.\nThe government\u2019s recent fracking ban could also come under pressure from US companies looking to operate here. In practically all the sectors identified by the committee on climate change as requiring decarbonisation policies \u2013 agriculture, power generation, transport \u2013 there will be a push to lock in market mechanisms, enshrine \u201ccompetition\u201d, and head off attempts at regulation.\nPerhaps most worryingly, the US has also indicated it will push for any agreement to include an investor-state dispute settlement \u2013 a controversial mechanism that gives foreign companies access to a supranational tribunal where they can sue entire countries within the bounds of the trade agreement but outside their own legal system. These have been used by companies to recoup \u201clost profits\u201d when countries try to introduce environmental legislation: for instance, the Canadian province of Quebec was sued by an oil company under the North American Free Trade Agreement after it banned fracking in 2011.\nWith an ISDS, a bad deal for climate would not only harm existing standards, it could also prevent climate policies being made in the future, either because they contradict the agreement or because they could open the government to trade disputes.\nClimate policy wouldn\u2019t cover a product quite as viscerally unappealing as chlorinated chicken, or an institution as beloved as the NHS, both of which have focused public anger on the usually arcane process of trade negotiation. The risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation, with changes across the entire economy \u2013 none big enough to contest on their own.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to work this way: the EU is currently proposing a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d that would force trading partners to comprehensively consider the climate impact of all their products and services, an example of how trade policy can be used to strengthen global climate efforts. But Liz Truss, the minister in charge of negotiations, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are deregulators of the highest order. Both were co-authors of the 2012 book Britannia Unchained, which criticised the UK for a \u201cbloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation\u201d. They maintain that the government is committed to its existing climate targets, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll actually back the protections we need in order to meet them.\n\u2022 Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment\nThe risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation", "label": 0}, "text-515": {"text": "'Meth.

There is a subtlety to the way Bernard Fanning turns the knife in the chorus, as if trying to lower Hanson\u2019s tone to a whisper so that we all might hear her venom.

USCM members also called for a quick electrification of the U.S. transportation sector and increased government intervention to prop up the wind-energy industry.\nThe mainstream media\u2019s stories about the mayors\u2019 actions promote the narrative the mayors defied Trump and will meet the Paris climate agreement goals regardless of the federal government\u2019s position on climate change, but they are uniformly light on facts and context. For instance, none of the stories, nor USCM\u2019s website, reports what the final vote was on each of the resolutions passed. Was it an overwhelming majority who favored the resolutions, or was it a close vote?\nSome measure of the number of mayors who are truly committed to Paris and the green agenda might be found in a poll taken before the conference. USCM said the survey \u201cfound overwhelming interest by cities to accelerate climate efforts,\u201d with 69 percent of responding cities generating or purchasing renewable electricity to power city buildings or operations; 63 percent already buying hybrid, electric, natural gas, and/or biodiesel for their municipal fleets; and 71 percent implementing energy-efficiency policies for new municipal buildings.\nHowever, just 66 of the 1,408 cities who are members of the USCM \u2014 less than five percent \u2014 responded to the survey. Since the mayors most active in promoting green programs would be the likeliest to respond to this survey, it seems very few of the total number of USCM members wanted to stand up and have their voices counted in the climate fight. In fact, just over 200 cities have formally committed to pursuing the emissions reductions demanded in the Paris climate agreement.\nIt\u2019s clear USCM\u2019s claims have not been backed up by the actions taken by the vast majority of its member cities.\nBaltimore and Chicago, among many other cities, have growing crime and murder rates. In many places, the relationship and trust between citizens and their police forces are at historic lows, with beat cops increasingly under fire (literally). Additionally, cities around the country are facing numerous crises; their streets are riddled with potholes, bridges are crumbling, public transit systems are breaking down, sewage services are out of date, school systems are failing, they lack the funding to open municipal pools during the summer, libraries are closing, cities are cancelling summer reading programs for kids, and public employees\u2019 retirement funds are woefully underfunded.\nMany of the guys and gals who have the temerity to lecture the president of the United States on climate matters have run their cities into the ground and are now begging the federal government for help to avoid municipal bankruptcy, for increased school funding, and to fix local roads and transit systems.\nDespite radical environmentalists\u2019 claims, mayors, city councils, and cities can do relatively little to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions low enough to hit the Paris targets. States, not cities, regulate the power supply within their borders. So, while cities can put some solar panels on rooftops of city buildings; purchase wind and solar energy through the grid, or at least buy renewable-energy credits that purport to show someone somewhere is building and purchasing wind or solar power (though not the city itself); plant trees; and buy natural gas or electric vehicles to reduce emissions, none of these policies will have a substantial impact on emissions. Most cities don\u2019t even have the authority to impose carbon or energy taxes.\nHowever, cities that do pursue these policies will most assuredly increase costs for taxpayers, businesses, and consumers \u2014 and all for very little, if any, benefit. The costs associated with using wind and solar electricity and electric vehicles are simply much higher than the expenses related to more-reliable fossil-fuel power plants and vehicles. States and European countries that have gone the furthest to cut carbon-dioxide emissions pay two to three times more for energy than states and countries that rely primarily on fossil fuels for energy.\nRather than wasting time and resources and raising energy costs on citizens and businesses \u2014 proven killers of economic growth \u2014 to pay for feel-good programs that will ultimately have no measurable impact on climate, mayors should focus on solving the local issues they were elected to confront and take steps to make their cities more attractive to businesses.\nMayors were elected to solve local problems, and say whatever you want about global warming, it is definitely\u00a0not\u00a0a local problem.\n[Originally Published at American Spectator]", "label": 1}, "text-522": {"text": "In 1991, just after the Soviet Union collapsed, I attended a conference on environmental economics and policy. Several speakers warned obituaries for socialism were premature, saying that, with socialism discredited on economic grounds, it would now be sold as a panacea for environmental problems.\nThey were right. The Left is actively campaigning for socialism today, with many arguing socialism offers a cure\u2014the only cure\u2014for climate change.\nSocialist Plans Rising\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) latest report calls for governments around the world to take over finance, restructure entire economies, and undertake massive international wealth transfers to equalize incomes around the world. IPCC\u2019s report also suggests we replace individual rights with collectivism.\nSimilarly, two European economists with the Institute for New Economic Thinking, Enno Schr\u00f6der and Servass Storm, claim the only solution to climate change is a radical takeover of economies by governments. They argue climate change is an immediate existential threat and only government can impose the rapid radical restructuring required to prevent it.\nIn the United States, high-profile Democrats in Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), are promoting a Green New Deal (GND) that would, among other things, eliminate all fossil fuels in ten years, create a massive federal public works and jobs program, and establish universal basic income and health care.\nThese proposals by the UN and U.S. leftists are unabashed, explicit proposals to replace market freedom and limited government with socialism. Governments and international agencies are promoting climate or green socialism, with the younger, more energetic wing of the Democrat Party seemingly committing to it enthusiastically. Leftist think tanks and policy institutes are working to advance it.\nEconomic Shock, Shrinkage\nIf the United States adopts the climate socialist agenda, it will eliminate freedom and create economic and political catastrophe, without solving any climate problems. Rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels would cause a massive negative shock to the economy. Production and incomes would fall, and unemployment and poverty would rise.\nCurrently, almost two-thirds of U.S. electricity comes from fossil fuel sources, and another 29 percent is from nuclear, hydroelectric, and geothermal. Wind and solar account for a little over 7 percent. Wind and solar are intermittent\u2014energy generation is not under human control but dependent on when the wind blows and the Sun shines. Energy must be available when people need it, not when sun and wind permit, and extreme fluctuations in electricity can shut down electric grids.\nIn addition, the scale and pace with which solar and wind would have to be deployed to replace fossil fuels is impossible given existing technology. Mandating rapid decarbonization under climate socialism would greatly reduce available electricity and shrink the economy.\nStopped in Our Tracks\nClimate socialism would impact transportation also. Quickly replacing the entire automotive fleet with electric vehicles would require massive increases\u00a0in electrical power, yet that power would decrease under green socialism. For air transportation, there are no reasonable alternatives to petroleum-derived aviation fuels, and no substitutes for fuel oil, diesel, or natural gas for shipping. Transportation would grind to a halt.\nRedistribution programs proposed by GND, such as a universal basic income, would further shrink the economy. Recipients become dependent on government as their incentive to work and be self-responsible is reduced. Similarly, finding themselves treated as beasts of burden, taxpayers\u2019 incentives to work is reduced.\nDisincentivizing work for recipients and payers results in less being produced and lower income overall. The nation is poorer.\nEconomic Destruction\nHistory consistently shows central planning destroys economies.\nIn a free market, independent decision makers\u2014households and firms, consumers, workers, and asset owners\u2014make decisions coordinated by market prices.\nCentral planning replaces this with direction by government \u201cexperts.\u201d It does not work. Without market prices, government cannot identify the opportunity costs of its actions, and therefore it cannot minimize waste. It is not sustainable.\nThis has been repeatedly shown\u2014in the USSR, Venezuela, Cuba, and everywhere else real socialism has been tried. Central planners wreck their economies because they lack market prices to determine whether their actions create greater benefits than costs.\nSome green socialists such as Ocasio-Cortez dishonestly claim Scandinavian countries show socialism can work. Recently, Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen put that lie to rest, saying, \u201cI know that some people in the U.S. associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist, planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\u201d\nAlso, central planning places enormous power\u2014life-or-death power\u2014in the hands of planners. Everyone is beholden to those who direct the economy, and everyone must follow government\u2019s orders, or else. Green socialists presume people who are just and wise will be in charge (i.e., themselves), but history demonstrates no one should be trusted with such power. That\u2019s why the American federal system was designed to put strict limits on government power.\nSocialism Won\u2019t Save Climate\nIronically, if the United States or even the entire developed world imposed climate socialism, it would not prevent climate change.\nMost greenhouse gas emissions in the future will come from China and other developing countries that have no intention of restricting their economies with green socialism.\nClimate socialism will Venezuela-ize America if we adopt it.

Nine retains control of all content.\u201d\nSpecial features include a \u201cOne on One interview with a Journalist\u201d and \u201cExclusive mention in the editorial\u201d.\nAll this exposure comes at a cost though: $5,500 for one or $10,000 for both papers. The climate series is what is referred to as an advertising feature in the newspaper business. Paid content is a common revenue-raising product used by most media companies, including the Guardian, especially since digital disruption hit.\nBut one of the not-for-profits approached was not impressed by Nine\u2019s commercial approach \u201cin the middle of a climate crisis\u201d and at a time when more than 250 newsrooms are boosting their climate coverage in the global initiative Covering Climate Now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle to get the climate crisis properly reported,\u201d Climate and Health Alliance\u2019s executive director, Fiona Armstrong, said.\n\u201cIt is rare to see a news story on the health impacts of climate change, which are already affecting the lives of people in Australia, and around the world, every day.\n\u201cThere is no way we could afford the $10,000 we were told it would cost to get our work covered in both papers.\u201d\nIt shouldn\u2019t be up to non-profits like us to bear the cost of critical climate coverage. While @TheAge & @SMH are not yet part of @CoveringClimate, other outlets are, like @Guardian & @Croakey, and they frequently cover climate without asking us to pay.\nHours after we approached Nine for a comment the series was \u201crevoked\u201d.\n\u201cLike all major media companies, including the Guardian, BBC and News Corp, we sell clearly labelled sponsored content,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\u201cIn this case, a third party company we work with pitched this advertorial with no involvement from editorial. We chose to revoke the proposal after reviewing it and finding it did not meet the standards that apply to sponsored content within our publications.\n\u201cOur journalists are not involved in sponsored content, just as the Guardian\u2019s staff journalists are not involved in its extensive advertorial operations.\u201d\nAs two of the booking deadlines for copy and payment had already passed, this is indeed an 11th-hour decision.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how pressure is put on young reporters to approach an assignment in a particular way, a Courier-Mail editor has given us a none too subtle glimpse into the process.\nWhile rookie reporter Chloe Read was on the road tweeting professionally about street protests in Brisbane, a senior editor back in the newsroom had different ideas.\nDamien Tomlinson, a seasoned night editor who appears regularly on Sky News as a media commentator, had already decided how the protesters would be viewed by the Murdoch paper.\nHe urged his Twitter followers to follow Read for news about Extinction Rebellion\u2019s movements in Brisbane.\nFollow @cloe_read for updates on the climate nutters in Brisbane.

These days it\u2019s just a lot more public.\nIta Buttrose is fast becoming as prolific a media commentator as Mark Scott was when he was ABC managing director.\nThis week the chair of the public broadcaster did the rounds of ABC shows to talk up the corporation\u2019s interactive tool Australia Talks, which tracks our social attitudes to a range of topics.\nAs the former magazine publisher and editor has an opinion on just about everything, she managed to make news for saying political correctness had gone too far while also decrying that the media was too white.\nWhich was all too contradictory for News Corp commentators Tim Blair and Andrew Bolt. They agreed with her first point but railed against her second.\n\u201cPick one, Ita,\u201d Blair pleaded. \u201cPolitically correct racial quotas or fun. Because you can\u2019t have both.\u201d\nBolt seized on her point about the lack of diversity in the media to argue that Buttrose\u2019s position provides \u201ccover to the leftists who\u2019ve purged the ABC of conservatives\u201d.\nIn a thinly veiled reference to News Corp, in particular the Australian, which has been waging a war with Aunty since Rupert was a boy, Buttrose said: \u201cI really resent the constant harping of our critics. I resent some of the comments about us. You\u2019d be lost if you couldn\u2019t fill your pages with us.\u201d\nRight on cue, Bolt gave Buttrose what she hates the most.\nBolt: \u201cBut whether the ABC presenter is a white, Jewish old guy like [Jon] Faine or a brown, Muslim younger guy like [Waleed] Aly doesn\u2019t change the ABC\u2019s politics.\n\u201cBoth are anti-Trump, anti-conservative global-warming alarmists.\n\u201cAnd when Faine quits the ABC this week, he\u2019ll be replaced by a woman, Virginia Trioli, who is \u2013 politically speaking \u2013 a Faine in skirts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. The more diverse the ABC becomes \u2013 more women! more Muslims! more Asians! \u2013 the less diverse its politics.\u201d\nFaine in skirts? We\u2019re sure Trioli appreciated that description.\nThe former ABC managing director, Michelle Guthrie, cost the ABC more than just upheaval and negative headlines. She walked away with $1.64m after she was sacked by the board, but the bills at Aunty kept rolling in.\nGuthrie was paid $911,917 \u2013 just over one year\u2019s salary \u2013 when her employment was terminated halfway into her five-year tenure last September, and an extra $730,000 when she sued for wrongful dismissal.\nBut just before Christmas she filed a lawsuit claiming the board\u2019s decision to dismiss her from her role was unfair.\nThe legal action the ABC had to take to ward off a potential legal bill of $2m for a full-blown court case was revealed this week when a freedom of information request was published.\nNow FOI documents reveal the ABC spent another $233,913.66 on legal advice from Minter Ellison fighting her legal action.\nGuthrie\u2019s successor, David Anderson, was left not just with a massive legal bill and associated fallout from Guthrie\u2019s turmoil, but a budget cut imposed by the Coalition, which came into effect this financial year. The cut had a first-year impact of $14.6m, and is on top of the $254m the ABC has had to absorb in efficiency cuts over the past five years.\nAnderson told staff this week that he had already found some savings \u2013 to the tune of $17m \u2013 to make a dent in the $84m hole over the next three years.\nSome money was found by renegotiating the deal with Foxtel, which saw the ABC\u2019s channels retransmitted on the pay-TV platform, and a new deal which will see ABC iview join the suite of on-demand services such as Netflix that are available through Foxtel\u2019s IQ3 and IQ4 set-top boxes.\nNow Anderson is looking at the ABC\u2019s property assets to free up some cash.\n\u201cWe will also undertake reviews of our property portfolio and our acquisitions expenditure to achieve further savings,\u201d Anderson said.", "label": 0}, "text-524": {"text": "The Guardian view on Extinction Rebellion: numbers alone won\u2019t create change\nThe speed and size of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests over the past year add weight to the idea that people in this decade were in revolt before they had any clear idea what form a revolution might take. Politically it has long looked like a whole generation was up for grabs. In the beginning of the decade this anger veered leftwards with movements like Occupy, but at the end it has moved greenwards, under XR. The question is how much of the country will go with it.\nExtinction Rebellion succeeded in putting the climate crisis on the political agenda. This is a welcome pivot to an existential issue for a society that has become gummed up by enervating fights over Brexit. There is an urgent need to decouple economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction. For all the fine words global emissions of carbon dioxide are higher than they have ever been, almost three decades after the first global conference aimed at reducing them. The situation is becoming dangerous for human life. The latest figures show there is little more than a decade to save ourselves and the other creatures with whom we share the planet.\nTo meet this challenge it is heartening that XR has adopted non-violent resistance, in which unarmed people engage in a coordinated set of strikes, rallies and boycotts to confront the authorities over environmental inaction. When the group shut down major parts of central London with a carnival of protest making business as usual impossible in April, the demonstrators ended up meeting with London\u2019s mayor and cabinet ministers before securing their aim of getting parliament to declare a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. Extinction Rebellion\u2019s policy and language have become mainstream in a remarkably short space of time. By comparison it might appear that this latest set of \u201cuprisings\u201d has seen XR go backwards rather than forward. There were no meetings with high-profile politicians. The targetting of London\u2019s public transport network at rush hour would have lost the group significant goodwill among parts of the population. Yet XR has gone global, with 60 cities experiencing protests.\nXR has become more inventive as the protests against the National Portrait Gallery\u2019s links with BP attest. In Britain the use of arrest as a tactic to draw more support has been particularly effective, with 1,700 peaceful protesters so far hauled away by the police as a record number of people took part in acts of resistance. The police in London will also have helped build opposition by taking measures which amount to an assault on the right to protest. If the authorities adopt a harder line they will boost the power of non-violence, by attracting people to demonstrations because of heavy-handed tactics.\nDisobedience is at the heart of non-violent struggle. As Martin Luther King Jr wrote: \u201cWe know through painful experience that freedom is never given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\u201d XR\u2019s strategy is influenced by the work of Harvard\u2019s Erica Chenoweth, whose studies revealed that campaigns of non-violent resistance were twice as effective as ones which used violence in achieving their goals, and campaigns that involved more than 3.5% of the population \u2013 in the UK that is 2.3m people \u2013 invariably succeeded. But numbers alone will not create change; crowds are necessary but not sufficient. There\u2019s also a danger that people show up but nothing changes \u2013 that mass action doesn\u2019t work. This is the wrong conclusion to draw. However, people being in the streets isn\u2019t effective without a strategy, and XR needs a clearer one for what could be years of struggle. There is an open question whether tactics that toppled dictators work in a liberal democracy. \nThis perhaps explains XR\u2019s reluctance to spell out whether it wishes to achieve a revolution to overturn a political order or to create pressure to persuade governments to act. Reform or revolution \u2013 XR will have to make this call as it reflects on its own success.", "label": 0}, "text-525": {"text": "Slum golf: the sport that stormed the streets of Mumbai\nAnil Bajrang Mane grew up in a slum in Chembur, a suburb of Mumbai. His home \u2013 a single 10ft x 10ftroom \u2013 was right over the wall from the 10th hole of the members-only Bombay Presidency Golf Club, which sprawls across 100 acres of land: prime real estate in a city where the average population density is 31,700 people per sq km.\nWhen Mane was just 14, he dropped out of school to become a caddie on the other side of the wall. But it wasn\u2019t until three years later, when he was 17, that he took his first swing, when a club member handed him a 7 iron and told him to have a go. The 150-yard shot changed his life, he says: he realised golf was his shot at fame and glory, the chance of a better life.\nThere was only one problem: the club didn\u2019t allow caddies to play on the course, insisting it would detract from its \u201cexclusivity\u201d. Mane earned his livelihood in a world that wouldn\u2019t allow him to participate. Every night, he would cross back from the verdant, genteel club into his own world of single-room tenements, corrugated tin rooftops and poverty.\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s health was frail and my father had suffered burns when a kerosene stove burst in our kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no option but to give up school and take up work.\u201d\nBut that didn\u2019t hurt his love for golf. So he and his friends perfected a different game, one they unironically call \u201cslum golf\u201d.\nSlum golf is exactly what it sounds like: golf played in the narrow streets and alleyways of their informal community. The golfers sometimes dodge the street\u2019s anatomy, but mostly they take advantage of it. Their \u201cteeing ground\u201d, \u201cfairway\u201d and \u201chazards\u201d include houses, walls, drains, construction debris, parked vehicles, sleeping dogs, garbage dumps, stray cows and potholes. They play with cheap plastic ping pong balls and clubs made from construction rebar, fitted with hosepipe for grips.\nWhen Mane and his friends play, they wager 50 rupees (\u00a30.54) a head. Winner takes the spoils.\nThe first hole is outside Mane\u2019s friend Suresh Ramesh Mehboobani\u2019s doorstep. Like Mane, Mehboobani was a caddie while living in the Sindhi Camp slum, this one originally a refugee settlement that borders the golf course.\n\u201cSlum golf is what we do for fun,\u201d Mehboobani says. \u201cIt started out as a way to have a go at the game when the club rules didn\u2019t allow caddies to play on the course.\u201d\nAlthough the club has since slightly relaxed its rules \u2013 it now allows caddies to use the club on Mondays, when it is closed to members \u2013 Mehboobani says they still play slum golf \u201cfor the fun of it, especially during the monsoon months, when the rains play havoc in Mumbai\u201d.\nSo when the German golfer Norman Dick stumbled upon a YouTube video of Mane and his friends teeing off from a \u201chole\u201d in the broken, rain-soaked concrete of their city, he immediately saw a younger, more energetic and freewheeling alternative to the stodgy golf played by middle-aged businesspeople, and decided he had to find a way to invite them to Paris for the World Urban Golf Cup.\nUrban golf is not unlike slum golf: a guerrilla version of the game played in urban settings using the natural obstacles endemic to any city.\n\u201cIn Europe, we have a wonderful community of urban golfers who meet at tournaments that take place on the streets of European cities,\u201d Dick says. \u201cAll these tournaments have one thing in common. Everybody who wants to play, can play. Even if you don\u2019t have the money, we find a way.\u201d\nHe got in touch with Mane, Mehboobani and four fellow slum golfers and invited them to Paris to represent India. The European teams playing in the tournament collectively pitched in to pay for the Indian team\u2019s flights, visas and hotel.\nThe tournament took place in September 2018, and of the 10 national teams the Indians came in fifth. Even more than the result, they enjoyed the experience as a glimpse of a life removed from their everyday realities in Mumbai.\n\u201cWhat I loved best about Paris is that we felt free. The streets were clean, the traffic was orderly, we could play golf on the streets without a care,\u201d Mehboobani says. \u201cWe could even have a beer out in the open. When we stood fifth, the organisers surprised us with tickets to the Ryder Cup, where we got to see Tiger Woods play. That blew us away.\u201d\nBack in Mumbai, life goes on. Mane turned pro in 2010 and now teaches on the course, while most of his friends still caddie there, waking every morning at 5.30 to attend the lottery draw used to pick the day\u2019s caddies. On a good day they stand to earn 1,000 rupees (\u00a311), tips included.\nThey dream of going pro like Mane, and indeed many professional players on the Indian circuit are former caddies from poor backgrounds. But professional tournaments are expensive to enter, often 50,000 rupees (\u00a3550) or more, and while a fortunate few manage to find corporate sponsors, the others must rely on private support from generous club members.\nTraining, too, is expensive and time-consuming. \u201cYou need to hit at least 1,000 balls a day as part of your training to go pro,\u201d says Mehboobani. He says it is a luxury most cannot afford.\nUntil then, they play slum golf. Mehboobani is the current undisputed champion.\n\u201cMy dream is to turn pro and win an international tournament,\u201d he says. \u201cThousands of caddies have come and gone over the decades. No one remembers them. No one knows who they were.

But within a few weeks the nationwide number had increased to 17,000, with cities including Mumbai showing thousands of cases and several hospitals shutting down in panic. Over the same time, Kerala \u2013 a relatively prosperous state on the southern tip of the subcontinent \u2013 would start to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. The \u201cKerala model\u201d is already being held up around the world as a success story. How did it do it?\nFirst, Kerala started from a strong baseline. Its socioeconomic development is an example of what investments in human capital can do for poverty reduction and prosperity. It has vastly higher literacy rates and better health outcomes than the rest of India; the state has long been a Communist party stronghold, although its policies remain moderately social-democratic. Some of its strengths are also weaknesses: skilled workers are the state\u2019s major export \u2013 it receives more remittances from abroad than anywhere else in India, much of which comes from the Middle East \u2013 and it is a large tourism hub. These are two factors that expose its inhabitants to a greater risk of transmission. \nThe first three confirmed patients in Kerala were Indian students living in Wuhan who had returned home during the Chinese new year. However, as feared, the following weeks saw a high number of infections in the state and the confirmed number of cases increased to more than 100 by 24 March. Kerala by then had one-fifth of Indian cases, despite having only 2.5% of India\u2019s population.\nThe reason Kerala has managed to come out the other side so quickly is because of its strong public health system, clear risk communication and community participation. Despite its communist rule, Kerala\u2019s healthcare system is, in fact, highly privatised, with a healthy division of labour between the public and private sectors. This very decentralised system has withstood the test of two serious floods and another viral outbreak in recent years, often making good use of the voluntary and active engagement of the public.\nKerala\u2019s efforts to address the pandemic had started as early as January. Indeed, its experience of dealing with the Nipah outbreak in 2018, a virus that had neither treatment nor vaccine available, came in handy. Learning from this episode, which saw a high proportion of hospital-acquired infections, the system had effective protocols in place, and stuck to the time-tested strategy of case isolation and contact-tracing, combined with an alert community surveillance system. Tens of thousands of people were in home quarantine this time, with compliance made possible via a mix of phone-based monitoring and neighbourhood watch initiatives.\nA severe lockdown was implemented before the national one: schools were shut, gatherings were banned, a stricter and longer quarantine than the national norm was deployed, and a few pious people who still insisted on praying in groups were even arrested. But this iron-fist approach was matched by socially valuable outreach policies. Supplies were home-delivered, midday meals from schools were sent to children even when schools were shut, regular and clear communication channels were established to dispel fake news, migrant labourers from other states were well taken care of, and mental health helplines were established across the state. The \u201cbreak the chain\u201d campaign to limit the Covid-19 spread was particularly successful.\nWhen unexpected events potentially exposed hundreds of people to infection, thousands of state-employed health workers and volunteers equipped with maps and flowcharts conducted aggressive contact-tracing and brought the situation under control. Kerala\u2019s has been an all-of-government, all-of-society approach, with even students chipping in, building walk-in kiosks for taking samples, inspired by the South Korean model. In addition to using the centrally procured real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing kits, Kerala was the first state to procure rapid test kits from the Pune-based Mylab.\nFor most people, Covid-19 is a mild infection that can go away without treatment and can, therefore, be missed easily. It is deadly perhaps also for the same reason. As rich, muscular hospital systems across the world \u2013 which have opted for a spaghetti western-style standoff with the coronavirus \u2013 are quickly getting overrun, perhaps there are lessons to be learned from the nimble-footed, community-oriented, cautiously aggressive approach that Kerala opted for. For a state that had its first patient in January, the profile of patients (more than 90% under 60 years old, thanks to social distancing protecting the old) as well as the number of deaths (just three), are nothing but impressive. \nWhile the curve has been flattened for now and transmission limited, the fact remains that Kerala is also riding the tiger of a strict economic lockdown in the rest of the country. Kerala aims to lift restrictions soon \u2013 a move that New Delhi has condemned . How it manages to ease the lockdown safely will depend on a large number of factors. The summer monsoon rains, the floods that will follow, as well as returning migrants will add layers of complexity. But one thing is clear: when the next wave of novel coronavirus hits, which it will, the state will be ready.\n\u2022 Oommen C Kurian leads the health initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, a thinktank based in New Delhi\n\u2022 This article was amended on 24 April 2020. An earlier version said the first three confirmed patients in Kerala were among those evacuated by the Indian government from Wuhan and quarantined during early February.

At that time, Republicans held majorities in the state legislature and congressional delegation, even though Democrats earned a significant share of the statewide vote, and the state is considered politically competitive. And the GOP lawmakers were not subtle: emails made public last year revealed a Republican aide bragging about cramming \u201cDem garbage\u201d into certain Michigan districts in 2011, as they drew the current electoral boundaries.\nBut Fahey\u2019s post would create a movement that could provide a roadmap for making US elections fairer. Coordinating over Google Docs and fanning out across the state, her effort grew into a group called Voters Not Politicians that would eventually amend the Michigan constitution to strip redistricting power from lawmakers. This week, Voters Not Politicians succeeded in protecting the new reform from yet another attack from Republicans in the state \u2013 underscoring how deeply entrenched gerrymandering has become, and how hard it is to end.\nGerrymandering reform advocates believe the Michigan effort can serve as a model for reform elsewhere (a similar effort recently launched in Oklahoma). Even the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, who wrote earlier this year that federal courts can\u2019t do anything to fix partisan gerrymandering, has held up the Michigan effort as a pathway for fixing the problem.\nBut Voters Not Politicians\u2019 success was far from guaranteed. Starting in 2017, Fahey and other members went to all of Michigan\u2019s 83 counties, using public meeting spaces like libraries to gather. They dressed up in costumes in the shape of gerrymandered districts at intersections and other busy places and even wrote jingles about the topic, according to NBC News. As the group grew to thousands of volunteers, its leaders emphasized that people should leave their personal politics at the door once they joined, Fahey said earlier this year.\nIn 2017, the group drafted the measure to give redistricting authority to 13 Michigan residents \u2013 four Democrats, four Republicans and five non-affiliated voters, instead of lawmakers. More than 2.5 million Michigan voters approved the measure to amend the Michigan constitution and create the commission last year.\nIn the recent lawsuit in Michigan, Republicans took issue with a provision prohibiting anyone with close partisan connections from serving on the panel to ensure the districts are drawn fairly. They argued that those restrictions effectively punish them for their political beliefs and asked a federal judge to stop the creation of the commission. In a decision on Monday, the US district judge Janet Neff declined that request, writing that the Republicans\u2019 arguments were unlikely to ultimately succeed in court. The Republican plaintiffs are appealing against the ruling.\nEven though there was overwhelming support for the measure \u2013 it passed with about 61% of the vote \u2013 Republicans have used every maneuver they can to try to stop it over the past two years. They unsuccessfully tried to kick the measure off the ballot in 2018. And once Michigan voters approved it, they brought two lawsuits in federal court this summer, arguing that the commission violated the US constitution.\nThe group successfully got the measure to pass and has fended off a mountain of legal challenges, even though the people leading the effort were all \u201cpolitical novices\u201d, said Nancy Wang, the executive director of Voters Not Politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting because these politicians, some of whom are plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against the amendment, are the ones that are supposed to be working for the voters that passed this amendment,\u201d she said.\nGerrymandering \u2013 the practice of drawing political boundaries for partisan gain \u2013 has helped Republicans maintain majorities in state legislatures and congressional delegations since 2011. Creating independent redistricting commissions, as Voters Not Politicians did, is seen as one of the most potent ways to fight excessive partisan gerrymandering because it strips the power of redistricting from politicians, who can craft districts to their benefit, and gives it to neutral mapmakers.\nThe decision on Tuesday means that the independent redistricting commission, not state lawmakers, is still expected to draw the state\u2019s electoral districts in 2021 for the first time. That\u2019s likely to create electoral districts that more accurately reflect Michigan\u2019s political makeup.\nMeanwhile, Fahey has joined a new group, The People, and plans to take the organizing lessons to other states. And Wang said the repeated victories in Michigan should also give people thinking about challenging gerrymandering elsewhere hope.\n\u201cVictories like ours give people a lot of faith and hope that they still can make a change. That people together are still stronger than the people who occupy political seats,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not gonna be an easy road.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.\nIn terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u00a0\nAt the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.\nRetailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.\nIn the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links.

Researchers found 78% of Australians supported reducing fossil fuel use and 64% raising taxes to help do that.\nAmong people who voted for the Morrison government at this year\u2019s election, 62% said they backed cutting fossil fuel use and nearly half, 48%, supported higher taxes.\nThere was overwhelming support to both questions from people who voted for Labor (88% and 79% respectively) or the Greens (96% and 88%).\nThe divide in the US between people who voted for Donald Trump and those who backed Hillary Clinton at the 2016 presidential election was much greater.\nAcross all voters in the US, support for reducing fossil fuel use was at 68%.

Here's how\nThe Americans have a saying: \u201cyou break it, you own it\u201d. In the world of climate diplomacy, the maxim is \u201cyou host it, you own it\u201d. In Copenhagen in 2009, the Danes owned a disastrous climate event that broke up in rancour. In Paris in 2015, the French owned the successful agreement.\nThe 2020 UN climate change conference, known as COP26, which will be taking place in Glasgow in November, could be Copenhagen or Paris, or somewhere in between. Ownership and responsibility will firmly rest with the government. The events of the past few days have proved beyond doubt, however, that we cannot leave it to the government alone. We all need to take ownership of this event.\nIn case you are not convinced, and feeling a bit inert, let me persuade you that this really matters: 2020 was the year nominated in the Paris agreement for when the world had to narrow the gap between its noble aspirations to limit global warming to 1.5C and its country-by-country commitments, which currently add up to, at best, 3C of warming. Given we only have a decade to decisively turn things around, we just cannot allow Glasgow to fail.\nThis is a massive moment and the government has so far simply been unable to get to grips with the importance and the complexity of these negotiations, as illustrated by the fiasco over the appointment and sacking of Claire O\u2019Neill, and the rather public \u2013 and so far fruitless \u2013 search for a president for COP26.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just the government that needs to step up. Success or failure will in part depend on how much it is made to care about the issue. That depends on all of us. If the government thinks it can slink out of Glasgow without too much notice being taken, it may well decide other priorities are more important. We cannot let that happen.\nThat means in practice, first, that the government must feel the pressure to act here at home. This summit is about persuading other countries to ratchet up their ambition. To succeed, we need to ratchet up ours and quickly.\nBritain has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 but currently our 2030 target does not reflect even that ambition. As we seek to persuade others to do more in the short term, we need a 2030 target of significantly greater ambition that puts us on track for net-zero by 2050.\nThis more ambitious target must be accompanied by action in every sector, and a budget on 11 March that focuses on this issue, and includes a proper 10-year plan to decarbonise homes over the coming decade, while cutting bills and creating jobs.\nSecond, crucial to the success of Glasgow is a strong alliance with the EU. Before Paris it was the US-China axis that made the crucial breakthrough. This time, with the US off the pitch under President Trump, the best hope is that the EU, which is responsible for 10% of global emissions, and China can act in concert to raise the level of ambition.\nThird, we have to recognise that every lever of government must be part of making this agreement happen, particularly around how public and private finance supports or thwarts the transition. That includes mobilising public and private finance for developing countries, ending international government support for fossil fuel extraction and building on the appointment of Mark Carney as the COP special envoy to ensure proper regulation of financial and corporate institutions around climate risk.\nFourth, over and above actions by national governments, Glasgow must power forward coalitions of states, cities, businesses and civil society around the path to net-zero, including the phasing out of coal, and petrol and diesel vehicles, divestment from fossil fuels, and addressing deforestation.\nThere are millions of people who care deeply about this issue in the UK and beyond. Extinction Rebellion and the pupil climate strikers have changed the terms of the debate over the past year. It\u2019s up to all of us, including our brilliant NGOs, to ensure this moment sees the biggest mobilisation on the climate emergency in British history.\nYou may wonder what the point of mobilisation is if the geopolitical forces are so badly aligned. The answer is there is no other option. The only way we will get change on this issue is showing government that there is a big political coalition that believes this really matters. Positive momentum from Glasgow is essential. We all need to step up. We all need to own it.\nOur future, and that of our children and grandchildren, is in the balance.

Suddenly everyone is talking about it,\u201d she said backstage at Paris fashion week.\nThis season, instead of a note explaining the inspiration behind the collection, she gave each guest a timeline detailing innovations in sustainable fashion over the past 19 years.\n\u201cI hope the timeline shows that some progress is being made. Things need to change immediately, but we also need to stay positive and hopeful. If you scare people so much that they are absolutely terrified, you can\u2019t engage them. They need to feel they can make a difference.\u201d\nThe night before the show, McCartney hosted a roundtable discussion on sustainability at the Palais Garnier show venue. Members of Extinction Rebellion and a founder of Bolt Threads, a Californian biotechnology company producing lab-grown silk and other fabric, took part in a discussion alongside environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertran, and animal rights activist and actor Maisie Williams.\nHer years of attempting to enthuse the industry about the environment before it became fashionable have made McCartney a dab hand at sexing up sustainability.\nThe catwalk show was accompanied by grainy video footage of zebras and hippos having sex, to a sultry soundtrack of Donna Summer singing Love to Love You Baby. The Stella vibe being very much on trend, it made good business sense for this collection to focus on the looks for which the brand is best known. So there was soft-power tailoring, a staple since McCartney\u2019s days as a trainee on Savile Row, in shades of peach, toffee and soft, unbleached white.\nThere were 1970s-bohemian denim skirts, and silk blouses with scalloped edges. Amber Valetta, who had taken part in the previous evening\u2019s sustainability discussion, wore a moss-green silk trench, while the wildflower prints on silk dresses came from photos McCartney took on bike rides through the English countryside. With recycled polyester, organic cotton, regenerated cashmere and handbags made of sustainable raffia or second-life plastics, it marked the brand\u2019s most sustainable collection to date.\n\u201cBut I hope that when you watch the show you don\u2019t even notice that, actually,\u201d the designer said backstage. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s just desirable and beautiful and luxurious.\u201d\nThe brand has partnered with resale company TheRealReal in a deal which incentivises McCartney\u2019s designer shoppers to participate in the circular economy by reselling their purchases. \u201cWe spend a lot of time on fabric technology, but the circular economy is another huge part of the story,\u201d said McCartney.\n\u201cThe youth of today, really they should be wearing vintage and secondhand clothes, and looking at renting clothes - and they are absolutely doing that. Fabric innovation, combined with this youth culture - it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\nBut despite her championing of the circular economy, McCartney is expanding the brand. Backstage after the show, alongside her father, Sir Paul, and fellow fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, she was joined by her new business partners, the Arnault family who control LVMH.\nIn July, one year after having bought back full control of her brand from her initial backers, Kering, McCartney announced that she was partnering with LVMH, the world\u2019s biggest luxury house. She remains majority shareholder, but the deep pockets of LMVH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, bring the opportunity for accelerated growth. As part of the agreement, McCartney holds the role of special adviser on sustainability to Bernard Arnault.\nNatalia Vodianova, longtime favourite model of McCartney and wife of LVMH scion Antoine Arnault, did not appear on the catwalk this season but sat front row in a new-season Koba coat. Made from recycled polyester blended with a corn byproduct, Koba is a breakthrough in faux fur, a process that previously relied on environmentally damaging petroleum-based products.", "label": 0}, "text-543": {"text": "What having a heart attack taught me about Brexit\nSomething can be massive without being obvious, as I learned by having a heart attack. The symptoms should not have left doubt: sudden, severe chest pain; a burning lash down the left arm; air refusing to enter the lungs; a vibrating sense of ill-being, the world turning sour and dark.\nStill I hesitated before getting help. At some level I knew what was up, but really not wanting a heart attack seemed like a compelling reason why I wasn\u2019t having one. Forty-five seemed a bit premature for that sort of thing. Later, recovering in hospital, I was described as young with a frequency that would be flattering in other contexts.\nIn hindsight, the symptoms had started a lot earlier. The feeling in my chest was an extreme variant of tightness I had felt before while running, and dismissed as unfitness. (Turns out: angina.) Such is the awesome power of denial, a psychological term cheapened by overuse. We are always describing others and even deprecating ourselves for being \u201cin denial\u201d of the smallest things, which is itself a kind of denial. Admitting shortsightedness around minor flaws is a way to avoid admitting blindness to much worse.\nI was still hooked up to cardiac monitors and full of morphine, barely an hour after the insertion of two stents, when the metaphorical comparisons first presented themselves. The Labour party had ignored vital warning signs for years, failing to change course when avoidance of calamity was still available. So too had Britain\u2019s pro-European campaign. I won\u2019t stress the point too hard, being on doctor\u2019s orders to minimise stress of all kinds. The compulsion to turn even my own medical emergency into a political analogy flagged a lifestyle habit in need of healthy adaptation. A month of convalescence has taught me to care differently. Not less, but less angrily.\nIt pushes the metaphor too far to say that Brexit broke my heart. I was culturally and emotionally attached to the European project and still believe UK involvement has improved this country. It will hurt on Friday night when EU membership ends, but not as much as it hurts when a blocked artery cuts off blood to the left ventricle. Having survived one of those experiences, I am palpably more relaxed facing the other one. It also helps to understand those hearts that will leap at 11pm on 31 January.\nThat sensitivity does not include deference to asinine Tory MPs licking their lips and commemorative stamps with triumphant relish. One of their number, Mark Francois, says he will stay up all night to \u201cwatch the sun rise on a free country\u201d. Neither he nor any of his co-fetishists has satisfactorily explained what, in practice, they will be free to do on Saturday that is forbidden today.\nIn truth, the measurable liberties available that dawn will be European ones, preserved thanks to a transition period that the all-nighter Brexit celebrants resent as deferral of a greater rupture.\nBut there I have lapsed into another bad old habit. Remainers lost the argument with arch, eye-rolling negativity. In 2016 the pro-European case was made exclusively in terms of loss \u2013 forfeited growth, shrunken prestige, jettisoned jobs \u2013 while the leavers advertised gains. After the referendum, those Brexit promises were assailed by fact-checkers, myth-busters, expert debunkers, but what was the counter offer? What would leavers get in exchange for surrendering a prize for which they had voted, to which they were democratically entitled and which they had not yet received?\nOn we went, rubbishing the idea that Brexit was a bounty of freedom, sovereignty and control, irritating more than we converted, until Boris Johnson came along to lift the siege. By December, the liberation he could realistically offer voters wasn\u2019t from Europe any more, it was from the argument encircling them. It was from us, the remainers.\nJohnson\u2019s winning formula was to downgrade the promise of Brexit from reward to relief, which was easier to deliver and still sounded marvellous. His opponents complain that the \u201cBoris\u201d brand of optimism is fraudulent, but that doesn\u2019t matter when it is unrivalled in the market.\nPro-Europeans got stuck in a quicksand of nostalgia, rosily tinting the epoch of unchallenged EU membership as a golden age of moderation. It was easy to see it that way as the Conservative party waged war on economics and geography, making dissidents of its sanest MPs. But the remainer lament often sounded like privilege drowning in self-pity, which isn\u2019t any more attractive in politics than in other walks of life. We had facts on our side, certain ours was the rational position. The failure to change minds just seemed to prove that rationality itself was in peril. Donald Trump marauding from the White House supported that hypothesis. But for all the solidity of our claims, the case we built from them was hypothetical. Brexit hadn\u2019t happened yet, so we couldn\u2019t convincingly call it a disaster. Nothing, it seemed, was really happening, despite the frenzy in Westminster.\nThe whole of politics between the referendum and the 2019 election seems to have been conducted in zero gravity. Arguments that should have weight had none and any crazy notions, once hurled, could fly around with infinite momentum. Only in the unique conditions of space flight could a man built like Johnson cavort like a gymnast. The landing begins on Friday. The country will soon feel the friction of re-entry into a thicker political atmosphere.\nThe prime minister is already feeling the pressure of earthly decisions: high-speed rail; Chinese involvement in 5G infrastructure; the divergent pulls of strategic cosiness with Donald Trump and trade continuity with Europe. Each choice makes new enemies and limits future choices. Johnson\u2019s method so far has been to campaign against the very idea that government is difficult. It is certainly easier without effective opposition, but that advantage cannot endure forever.\nThe price of victory on a promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d is getting it done. On Friday we cross the threshold where Brexit must breathe the same air as other political projects. It sheds the immunity of abstraction and enters the realm of evidence. There will be no bracing inrush of liberty to get leaver hearts pumping, and no sudden cataclysm to vindicate remainers. If ending EU membership proves to be a mistake it will be a gradual tightening, a slow burn; the kind of problem that is easier to deny than to own.

Just one day in two weeks without rain. Another week\u2019s worth might be on the way. And soybeans are down $2.50 per bushel since the farmer\u2019s friend in the red MAGA cap assumed the presidency, at least a buck-per-bushel below break-even for most operators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a miserable spring,\u201d Lehman said.\nIowa farmers have been losing money five or six years straight. The climate crisis is making wilder weather the new normal in the Tall Corn state. Spring floods from heavy rains burst the levees of the mighty Mississippi so you could float a boat through downtown Davenport. On Iowa\u2019s west coast, the muddy Missouri raged through the Loess hills and valleys and took entire towns with it \u2013 Pacific Junction, population 470, and Hamburg, population 1,187. Tens of thousands of acres have been scoured, perhaps never to be probed by a corn planter again.\nThe politicians have toured and put their fingers to the wind. Iowa is vital electorally. It was key to Trump\u2019s victory, as was Wisconsin, similarly inundated by trade wars and oceans of corporate milk drowning independent dairy farmers.\nThey went back to DC and answered with a $19bn weather disaster aid package, with $3.3bn for the midwest. But a lone congressman from Texas named Chip Roy was able to hold it up, all by himself, over border-wall funding until Congress returns from a hard-earned Memorial Day vacation. Meanwhile, farm suicide rates are at their highest levels since the midwest depression of the mid-1980s. \nSince Trump wiped out our soybean market \u2013 three-quarters of Iowa\u2019s beans were bound for China \u2013 he threw farmers and livestock producers $12bn in trade disaster aid. Farmers call it the \u201cTrump bump\u201d. Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue announced another bump last week: $16bn to be targeted at the farm counties worst hit by losses in soy and pork trade. Nobody out here knows how much it will be or who gets paid. What they do know is that to get any of this next Trump bump you must plant a crop this year, come hell or high water.\n\u201cA lot of people will just be mudding it in for the trade aid rather than for the market,\u201d said Chad Hart, Iowa State University Extension markets economist. He said it will take weeks for rules to dribble out and months for payments to arrive. Don\u2019t plant or not plant based on rumors, he advises. He worries.\nBankers are trying to figure it all out, too. They\u2019re watching farm working capital erode every year. Government bailouts can\u2019t keep everyone whole. If you own the land you are treading water or making a little bit. If you are renting?\n\u201cIt\u2019s damn tough making it farming,\u201d said Dave Drey, Citizens First National Bank vice-president, who also farms with his brother Dennis near Storm Lake.\nHe, too, is groping for information to help his customers as world events and torrents of water whipsaw markets. He knows that government bailouts inevitably leave some farmers out, that they can be regionally targeted politically, that they distort rational decision-making, and that everyone would rather get their supper from the market and not the soup line.\nThat\u2019s what all the politicians mouth: trade over aid. Senator Chuck Grassley is chipping his teeth clucking on tariffs. Yet Republicans try to defend Trump in a state that is among the most export-sensitive in the nation. Senator Joni Ernst told Storm Lakers one recent rainy May day that farmers are willing to take the short-term pain for the long-term gain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the easiest thing to tell yourself that, but that is not what they\u2019re saying when they\u2019re talking to the banker,\u201d said Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.\nWhat gain? And how long the pain?\nLehman, 51, said a neighbor, in his 70s and farming with his son, popped by that morning idled by the weather. He was talking about markets and the rain. Not really about the future, how we could turn this all around and make ourselves right again. Everyone is stuck in the present muck.\nRepublicans try to defend Trump in a state that is among the most export-sensitive in the nation\nSpring weather like this usually scares the Chicago Board of Trade pits into a rally. Not this year because of the trade war. Then there is an African virus sweeping China that has culled 40% of its swine herd, further reducing soybean demand. Perish the thought of the flu hitting Iowa, the hog capital of the world with tens of thousands of dependent jobs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like everything is coming together all at once,\u201d said Rich Robinson, a 74-year-old farmer near Storm Lake. \u201cI really don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to end up.\u201d\nIt casts a pall over the midwest. Manufacturing profits are off because of rising steel costs. Line workers in Davenport feel it. Regional manufacturing towns are just hanging on. Most everybody in Iowa is one or two generations removed from the farm or the county seat town. They know. They spoke in the midterm elections by sending two new congresswomen to Washington.\nRural America has been in a squeeze the past 40 years. Presidential candidates are awake to it because rural people are confronting them with it: consolidation of the livestock industry (the largest pork producer in the US, Smithfield Foods, is owned by the Chinese), seed and chemical companies bidding for every acre with crops genetically modified for the next poison, and an imploding export market manipulated for political ends. The candidates are responding with serious proposals around anti-trust enforcement and directing more conservation aid to battle climate crisis. They remain abstractions on the 2020 horizon.\nFrustration is the word for here and now. It ripples everywhere.\nFarmer Robinson recalls five decades of work by Iowans trying to build that Chinese market as an answer to our chronic problem of over-production. \u201cNow it looks like it could have been all for naught,\u201d he lamented.\nAnd here we thought we had things under control when former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad was appointed ambassador to China. It could take years to restore those lost markets taken by Brazil and Argentina.\nThose are some formidable clouds to part. We all hope that they do, as a few sprouts come up from those fields touched during a window of sunshine. Everyone still cheers for corn knee-high by the Fourth of July.\nLehman just wants to plant the farm that\u2019s been in his family for five generations. Grumpiness started to fade when the sun peeked through for the Memorial Day weekend, and a breeze picked up to dry out that black gummy soil.\n\u201cYou find a way to work through it,\u201d he said, greasing that tractor one more time, an anxious gear jockey waiting for the gate to swing wide.", "label": 0}, "text-545": {"text": "The Guardian view on Covid-19 and politics: institutionally vulnerable\nLots of things about modern politics would surprise William Gladstone if the 19th-century Liberal prime minister was unexpectedly reincarnated into the Britain of 2020. Things like press conferences, video links and female MPs would all catch him out. Gladstone would, though, be reassured by one thing. He would easily be able to find his way around Westminster. That\u2019s because the corridors of power in which politics, parliament and government are conducted in 2020 are remarkably unchanged since he died in 1898. The warren of staircases and rooms in 10 Downing Street and the cramped Commons chamber, with MPs jostling through the division lobbies, would all be familiar to him.\nWhether Britain benefits or suffers from its traditionalised habits and settings of politics is a recurrent question. But the Covid-19 pandemic poses it in a new way. Parliament went on sitting through world wars and financial crises. Gladstone himself sat through the Great Stink of the summer of 1858, when the Thames became a sewer. But a modern pandemic that has made human proximity unsafe has meant that parliament cannot sit at all, and that MPs cannot do their fundamental job. Business in the chamber became a ghostly charade. Voting by crowding into the aye and no lobbies was deemed too dangerous to attempt. At the height of a national crisis, therefore, many of the checks and balances on government, and parliamentary democracy itself, have effectively collapsed. These issues must be addressed before parliament returns on 21 April.\nNow the Covid-19 virus has penetrated to the heart of government too. Last Friday, the three most important people leading the fight against the pandemic all went into self-isolation. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, have all been put out of action. So has the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. We wish them all well and a full recovery. But the disruption at the top of government is huge. The virus has done what the Luftwaffe and the IRA could not. It has made the work of leading the nation in an emergency significantly harder than it was already. When a government has just taken extraordinary powers to impose its rule, this is a particularly bad time to suffer that sort of hit.\nNone of this is to imply that all would be well if only Britain\u2019s government and parliament conducted their business in airy modern buildings with wider corridors, state-of-the-art health and safety provisions, and better designed workspaces. Berlin has spacious, modern government buildings of this kind, but Angela Merkel is having to self-isolate nevertheless. Prime ministers have also been stricken in past emergencies. In the first world war, David Lloyd George spent nine days with influenza in a temporary hospital inside Manchester town hall during the 1918 epidemic. In the second, Winston Churchill had a heart attack in late 1941 and serious pneumonia 15 months later. The reality is that the world cannot be designed, or politics conducted, without risk.\nNevertheless, there are lessons to consider and apply. Politics, like the health service, needs the best possible circumstances for it to do its job. The buildings should be more suitable. New ways, like electronic voting, must be prioritised. Before the pandemic, there was already widespread discussion about the adequacy of the institutions of British government and democracy, including their centralisation in London. Spurning a more imaginative modern approach, plans are under way to move parliament into a recreation of the existing chamber while the crumbling Palace of Westminster is refurbished at a cost of at least \u00a34bn, starting in 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic poses questions about that strategy which have to be examined. Many other aspects of public policy will have to be reconsidered when this crisis is over. The ways \u2013 and the places \u2013 in which we do politics must be part of that rethink too.", "label": 0}, "text-546": {"text": "Iowa caucuses: Pete Buttigieg's closing ad focuses on unity and change\nPete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign for the Democratic nomination for president is focusing on unity and change in the closing ad it is releasing before the Iowa caucuses on Monday.\nThe 60-second ad, obtained by The Guardian, was distributed to a set of supporters ahead of its release on Friday.

Costa Rica wanted to host the event but lacked the resources, so Latin America\u2019s richest per-capita economy \u2013 Chile \u2013 took control. Everything was set for a December COP in Santiago, billed as \u201cthe blue COP\u201d because at long last issues about the oceans would take centre stage.\nBut rioting in the capital and a political crisis forced the COP to be moved. The Spanish government \u2013 despite being in the throes of a general election \u2013 stepped up and offered Madrid, where this year\u2019s talks will now take place.\nThe abrupt change of venue has caused many headaches, not least for the young campaigner Greta Thunberg, who had to hitch a lift back across the Atlantic by boat. There will be less opportunity for Latin Americans to showcase their vital role in reducing emissions, and Brazil may escape some of the attention on its recent moves to exploit the Amazon rainforest.\nIt also means the conference will be scaled down, with room for fewer NGOs and businesses. Activists and protesters are hurriedly gearing up to make public pressure felt, and participants are hoping that the act of rescue will focus minds and lead to a spirit of cooperation.\nWorld leaders will not be turning up, though appearances by VIPs and celebrities cannot be ruled out.\nThe negotiations, which run until 13 December, will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.\nThe COPs, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which can be frustrating and means some countries \u2013 notably Saudi Arabia \u2013 can act as a drag on more ambitious action, but gives COP decisions global authority.\nEach of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the US, which is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord.\nUnder the landmark 2015 agreement, nations committed to holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. The vast majority of nations have now ratified the deal.\nThough the deal is legally binding, the commitments that countries have made to cut their emissions are not. These are known as nationally defined contributions which will have to be ratcheted up next year if the aims of Paris are to be met.\nSo far, the US has played a low-key role in the UN climate process under Donald Trump, but that could change to more damaging obstruction. \u201cAs in years past, the US plans to send an interagency delegation. The US delegation will engage in negotiations to protect US interest and level the playing field for US businesses,\u201d the state department said. Other potential obstructors include big oil powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, as well as Brazil and Bolivia. Key to progress at COP are China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, and India, whose emissions are rapidly rising.\nChina has been working hard to cut emissions, not least from the coal-fired power plants that have generated widespread air pollution. But new research from Global Energy Monitor has found that the country has increased its coal-burning capacity by more than 40GW in the 18 months to June, and plans more.\nChristine Shearer, an analyst at the NGO, said: \u201cChina\u2019s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.\u201d China is also funding the building of new coal-fired power plants elsewhere, including in South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nThe main subject up for discussion is a provision in the Paris agreement known as article 6, which allows for the use of a global market in carbon to help countries cut emissions and to fund measures that reduce emissions in developing countries.\nCarbon markets have been around since the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The broad idea is that rich countries could meet their targets by buying carbon credits that were awarded to projects reducing emissions in the developing world. In this way, rich nations bought themselves time, and poorer nations got cash to help them on the road to a green future. But the mechanism had basic flaws \u2013 with too many easy credits devaluing the system.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 led to the outright collapse of the carbon market. It has never fully recovered, and today projects to cut carbon in developing countries are more likely to rely on conventional fundraising or overseas aid.\nReviving the carbon markets through article 6 is seen as a worthy aim by many involved in climate finance. Trading could also help raise funds to prevent deforestation.\nFor some campaigners, however, the markets are a scam aimed at allowing rich countries to get away with continuing to burn fossil fuels while paying poor countries to clean up. \u201cWe do not have the luxury of talking about carbon offsets, we need absolute emissions cuts now. Offsetting is unacceptable in the face of the scale and pace of emissions reductions required, and we will oppose the creation of a new global carbon market,\u201d says Juan Pablo Osornio of Greenpeace.\nNat Keohane, senior vice-president at the US Environmental Defense Fund, and a former US COP delegate, rejects that analysis. \u201cIt is about cooperation \u2013 markets are cooperation, and they are a pathway to reducing emissions fast,\u201d he says. Cooperation among developed and developing countries is crucial, in his view. By funding, using and sharing technologies and methods of bringing down emissions in the developing world, rich countries are helping solve a crucial part of the global problem.\nHowever, he agrees that \u201cno deal on article 6 is better than a bad deal\u201d, and some countries are in danger of undermining the discussions by insisting on rule changes. Brazil, for instance, is accused of seeking double counting of its forests, by being allowed to count its tree cover towards its commitments to cut emissions under Paris, while also seeking to sell to other countries carbon credits received for keeping its forests standing.\nThis sets the scene for a bitter fight over article 6, which would endanger the delicate consensus achieved at Paris, and that must be preserved if countries are to fulfil the aims of Paris by ratcheting up their commitments to bring down emissions.\nThere are far bigger issues hanging over COP, but they will not be decided this year, just hinted at. The biggest alarm is that the aspiration set in Paris to constrain temperature rises will require unprecedented efforts to achieve. But individual country commitments to steer the world towards that best-case scenario were not part of the binding Paris deal, but contained in a non-binding addition.\nSo emissions are increasing again, temperatures are higher than ever, countries are not mandated by law to act \u2013 and time is running out: the IPCC concluded that on current rates we have little over a decade to halt emissions growth and bring down carbon rapidly to keep warming within the 1.5C threshold.\nCurrent commitments made by national governments under the Paris agreement fall far short of what is required \u2013 taken together, they would still condemn the world to an estimated temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of the century. According to the UN\u2019s latest \u201cemissions gap\u201d report, published a few days before the start of this year\u2019s talks, countries must reduce their greenhouse gases by about 7.6% a year for the next 10 years, to stay within the 1.5C limit. Closing that gap will be COP26\u2019s biggest task.\nEvery year, alas. To meet the Paris objectives, it is clear the national targets must be revised upwards, and the deadline for that process is next year \u2013 which is also when previous targets, set at Copenhagen, expire for many countries. That makes 2020 a pivotal year for climate action.\nArguably the most important function of this year\u2019s COP is to clear the way for the crunch summit next year, the most important meeting on the climate emergency since the Paris agreement was struck in 2015. The past five years have been spent thrashing out the \u201crulebook\u201d by which Paris would be implemented, in a long series of technical discussions on issues as arcane as how carbon sinks should be accounted for.\nThose discussions have been necessary to deal with the bureaucratic side of this complex international treaty, but they have not addressed the central issue of what emissions reduction commitments governments are prepared to offer.\nCOP26 will take place in Glasgow, and the UK will be charged with the vital diplomatic role of coaxing countries into the commitments needed \u2013 commitments that were so ambitious, compared with governments\u2019 meagre and sometimes reluctant offerings, that they could not be achieved in Paris five years ago.\nIn the years since Paris, new high-carbon infrastructure such as roads, coal-fired power plants and skyscrapers have continued to be built, and new oil and gas fields opened up. In addition, governments in some countries \u2013 the US, Brazil and Australia among the major economies \u2013 have been elected which are openly hostile to climate action.\nIndeed. You could argue that three decades of negotiation have produced just one agreement to hold temperatures to a limit that is too high, and we are not even remotely on track to honour that agreement. All the hard decisions in the Paris agreement have been put off to a conference next year that might be a disaster, going on current form. Meanwhile, the Amazon is burning, bush fires are raging in Australia and America, climate chaos is causing a humanitarian disaster every week, and our global plan is to have some more meetings.\nAnd yet if we didn\u2019t have this UN process, we\u2019d have to invent it. Without it, the world would be truly adrift and fully at the mercy of individual governments and vested commercial interests. Osornio says: \u201cWhether or not the UNFCCC is adequate isn\u2019t really the point \u2013 at the moment, it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. Without [it], we would have to create another multilateral process for the world to come together and address the global climate crisis. Upholding existing multilateral processes, like the UNFCCC, helps against the rise in nationalism and isolationism already threatening international cooperation.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-548": {"text": "'I've lost friends': the young climate strikers forced to go it alone\nIn a remote village in north Norfolk, nine-year-old Amelia Bradbury has been standing alone outside her school gates every Friday for months. Like hundreds of thousands of young people across the world, she is following Greta Thunberg\u2019s lead and campaigning for action on the climate crisis \u2013 but, far from any of the big city demonstrations, she\u2019s having to go it alone.\n\u201cI was quite scared the first time because no one was doing it with me,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing this because I care about something. I really want people to listen to me and to make a difference.\u201d\nShe holds a handmade sign reading: \u201cI\u2019m striking for our nature\u201d, and it is her passion for wildlife and the outdoors that keeps her going each week. On the weekends she volunteers for Norfolk Wildlife Trust with her family and enjoys birdwatching.\nNevertheless, there are times when striking alone can be difficult. \u201cIt is quite hard in the cold, especially when it\u2019s freezing,\u201d she says. A few of her friends at school are interested, but their parents are not so sure \u2013 with only one person, it is hard to get the ball rolling.\nAlthough there are young people from all walks of life striking alone, it\u2019s often those in rural areas who struggle to make themselves, and the issues they most care about, heard. Holly Gillibrand, 14, in Fort William has been striking for more than a year: \u201cThe bigger towns and cities get all this media attention, obviously, because a lot of people turn up.\n\u201cBut I think the media tend to forget about the people in the rural places around Scotland and the rest of the UK. We have a different perspective on things and our voices deserve to be put out there just as much as anyone else\u2019s.\u201d\nBut social media has provided a platform for rural voices to be amplified. In November Amelia\u2019s father uploaded a video of her to Twitter after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, failed to show up to the climate leadership debate before the election. In it she said: \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to be standing outside in the rain and you couldn\u2019t be bothered to turn up in a warm studio to debate the other leaders. How pathetic are you?\u201d\nIt generated more than 1,000 retweets and praise from the wildlife presenter Chris Packham. \u201cIt was a bit crazy but I feel really proud because it shows that people notice and care,\u201d Amelia says.\nIt was the power of social media that inspired Anna Kernahan, 17, Grace Maddrell, 14, and Helen Jackson, 21, to set up Solo But Not Alone, a Twitter page dedicated to sharing the stories of solo climate strikers.\n\u201cPeople will say: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not alone,\u2019 but it\u2019s hard to see that when you are sitting there at the strike and there\u2019s no one else around you, everyone\u2019s walking past,\u201d says Anna. She strikes alone in Belfast from 12pm to 3pm every Friday, often reading a book or catching up on homework. Although she struggles to get friends to join her, she has one powerful supporter to keep her going \u2013 Greta Thunberg.\n\u201cMy phone crashes whenever she retweets me because she gets so many likes,\u201d says Anna.\nWithin weeks of setting up Solo But Not Alone at the end of 2019, the trio had hundreds of followers, and have been able to profile solo strikers across the globe.\nIt has helped them connect with people such as Mulindwa Moses, a 23-year-old climate activist from Uganda who strikes alone on the roadside. At one point he did it for 55 days consecutively, but now just strikes on Fridays and Saturdays, raising awareness for the Save Congo Rainforest and Two Trees a Week campaigns.\nMoses was inspired to take action after speaking to people who had lost family members in landslides and floods, which he later found were being caused by the climate crisis. \u201cThere are literally no reports about the climate and ecological crisis in the media, which has kept the population ignorant, and leaders are taking advantage of this to not take action,\u201d Mulindwa says.\nLiving in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, he strikes alone not because he lives in an isolated area, but because of his country\u2019s lack of tolerance for climate activism.\n\u201cBeing a climate activist in Uganda is very hard,\u201d Mulindwa says. \u201cYou cannot hold a strike with large numbers to create awareness because the government [does not] allow it, and I have lost friends, who say they can no longer associate with me because I stand on the side of roads holding signs and spend most of my time planting trees.\u201d\nBut like other solo climate strikers around the world, his loneliness is eased by the support he receives from fellow climate activists online. Anna says: \u201cWe really want to make sure that even if only one person is striking, their voice is heard and it is loud.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-549": {"text": "Labour should learn from its history: the politics of cruelty will not serve it well\nIf you\u2019re ever on a train going north through Wolverhampton, look out of the window just after you pull out of the station and you\u2019ll see the privately run HMP Oakwood, one of the largest prisons in the country. It was commissioned and built by a Labour government that lost to the Tories shortly after building work began. I pass that prison \u2013 so close to the railway you can clearly see the cell windows \u2013 on the train every couple of weeks and remember that the attitude of Priti Patel didn\u2019t come from nowhere.\nNew Labour also built Yarl\u2019s Wood, the immigration detention centre for women and children. It built Brook House and Colnbrook immigration removal centres, near Gatwick and Heathrow airports, and turned Dungavel open prison in Scotland into a detention facility for people refused asylum. It revoked the asylum claim of Jimmy Mubenga, who died in October 2010 after being restrained on a flight intended to deport him from the UK to Angola.\nLabour did these things because it had decided that voters wanted a political culture defined by its cruelty and mean-spiritedness. In so doing, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown upheld a seam of deliberate brutality, both in rhetoric and policy.\nIn my lifetime we have seen Margaret Thatcher speaking of \u201cholding out the prospect of an end to immigration\u201d in 1978 and, as prime minister, declining to offer her condolences after the deaths of 13 young black people in a house fire in New Cross, London, in 1981. In 1993, John Major responded to the death of two-year-old James Bulger by insisting that \u201csociety needs to condemn a little more, and understand a little less\u201d and refusing to stand in the way of two 10-year-old boys being tried for his murder.\nThen came New Labour\u2019s attempt to elide condemnation with understanding, and what the theorist Stuart Hall called the \u201cdouble-shuffle\u201d of entrenching Thatcherite ideology under the guise of pragmatism. The more we were encouraged to believe that Labour was being as tough on the causes of crime as on crime itself, the more politics became a game of seeing what you could get away with in plain sight.\nHMP Oakwood is run by G4S and Yarl\u2019s Wood by Serco, a pattern of farming out the Home Office\u2019s dirty work that began under Labour. I can\u2019t imagine that, on the doorstep in 1997, 2001 and 2005, anyone promised to vote for the party on the condition that prisons were privatised. Yet Labour went ahead with the policy all the same, as it did with private finance initiatives \u2013 again, was this a compelling doorstep argument? \u2013 and the continual bullying of lone parents and council tenants as though they were, by definition, among the \u201ccauses\u201d of crime.\nAt least for council tenants, stigmatisation brought funding. Children\u2019s centres, new school buildings and renovations under the Decent Homes Standard made estates better places to live in than they had been. For these reasons and a multitude of others, despite Labour\u2019s loss in the 2019 election, it\u2019s important not to capitulate to the notion that the party\u2019s leftward turn was a fundamental mistake. It was necessary not only for the soul of the party, but for the soul of the society we live in \u2013 the one we seek to change in part by voting.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think we did \u201cwin the argument\u201d, as Jeremy Corbyn suggested. If we\u2019d won the argument, we wouldn\u2019t have lost the bloody election. The argument that did win in the 2019 election was the one for cynicism. When you grow up among cynics you imbibe a sense of what causes this mindset, and what it fuels in turn. Coming from a working-class background I\u2019m always astonished when things work out or go well, as I always expect things to go wrong. (Years of good fortune haven\u2019t done much to change this: it\u2019s hard to unlearn.)\nTranslate this sense of cynicism into a political context and the kinds of defeats, both large and small-scale, experienced by anyone who isn\u2019t from a comfortable background living in comfortable circumstances can drive votes based upon resentment and the expectation of disappointment. The rightwing press is well aware of this potential \u2013 and has constructed a worldview that takes resentment as its starting point.\nYet liberal and leftwing journalists ridicule the idea that Labour might win on a platform that doesn\u2019t pre-emptively include hanging and flogging, just in case. A sort of belt-and-braces approach: we\u2019ll accept the green new deal as long as you promise to press the nuclear button the first chance you get. That\u2019ll show \u2019em!\nSince the turn of the 1980s, the electorate has colluded in this game with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Cruelty and reaction are seen as a necessary pretext for political communication: all appeals to \u201cthe people\u201d must begin from the assumption that people in general are venal, tight-fisted and vengeful. The kinder interpretation of these impulses is that people are often afraid, and that fear makes them lash out.\nFear and insecurity can\u2019t be allayed by hanging and flogging. The lesson from the Home Office, for many years now, has been that you can always get someone else to do the jobs you don\u2019t want to do. One of those jobs is understanding how class warps society: how disappointment and struggle curdles into a resentment that can never be remedied by \u201cgiving people what they want\u201d.\nClass is the dirtiest laundry of all. No one wants to hang it out, let alone attempt to clean it. The consequence is that we\u2019re all trapped on this grim recriminatory carousel until a party or movement obtains the power, and the courage, to reject cruelty as an electoral strategy.\n\u2022 Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide", "label": 0}, "text-550": {"text": "Australian politics has to change forever when your own citizens cannot sleep or breathe\nThe night of New Year\u2019s Eve was a kind of slow torture. I spent it in Vincentia on the New South Wales south coast, lying with my seven-year-old son, unable to breathe or sleep as thick brown smoke filled the house. As I listened to my child coughing, calling out from the depths of his nightmares words that sounded like \u201cdon\u2019t die\u201d, I prayed for the Princes Highway to reopen.\nI write this not because I believe for one minute that what I went through compares to anything people further south on Australia\u2019s east coast experienced that night, or will this weekend, but because friends and family who live outside the region \u2013 whether in Sydney or other, unaffected parts of the country, such as Perth \u2013 asked me to.\nThey simply cannot believe it when I tell them what horrors are unfolding down there. There is a way to understand, I tell them \u2013 tune into ABC Illawarra local radio. Then you\u2019ll hear about the power outages, the food, fuel and water shortages, the stories of locals bringing water to families with children and babies trapped in cars fleeing Ulladulla and its surrounds, of supermarket staff at Milton guiding shoppers around darkened stores with head torches to find dried food because the refrigerated goods have all spoiled.\nBut in all likelihood they won\u2019t, so let me tell you what it was like, the final day of 2019, for my family.\nWe were at a village on Jervis Bay, where we had planned to see in 2020 with my brother-in-law and his wife. We knew there was fire around but we didn\u2019t understand the threat \u2013 who did?\nEverything changed at precisely 1.57pm, when the NSW Rural Fire Service emergency bushfire warning text message came through on our mobile phones \u2013 \u201cpeople nth of Ulladulla & in Bay & Basin & Nowra areas \u2013 seek shelter as fire arrives\u201d.\n\u201cWhere is Bay & Basin?\u201d asked my sister-in-law, who is from Melbourne.\n\u201cThat\u2019s here, where we are,\u201d my husband said.\nThey were at the shops, buying food for our celebration dinner, a meal we never cooked, as the night was spent formulating a fire plan, getting ready to evacuate, via the sea in kayaks if it came to that.\nIt was hard to keep a level head as our hearts raced, our panic escalated, as ash fell, the sky blackened and night fell hours before actual sunset. Local ABC radio was our lifeline \u2013 and surely, after this summer, the federal government will increase the ABC\u2019s funding? \u2013 and it was how we learnt the fire had reached Sussex Inlet on the southern side of St Georges Basin (12km away), where we heard that power and telecommunications would be lost during the night, that people in Lake Conjola were jumping into the lake to escape raging fires (30km away).\nWhat did we do?\nWe gathered up woollen blankets, towels and bottled water and placed them outside on the deck. We assigned lifejackets (we had enough for the women and child). We opened all the gates, pulled out the kayaks. We filled the bath, readied the hoses. We dressed in the most appropriate clothes we had, inadequate though they were. We bought batteries from the service station for the radio and torches (the local Coles closed an hour after the RFS text message came through).\nWe found Ziploc bags for our mobile phones, in case they fell into the sea. My husband and his brother organised shifts to stay awake throughout the night, to monitor the radio and sky either side of the house for the orange glow that we hoped would never come. Our plan, if it did, was to don lifejackets, take the women, child and dogs to the beach, and then the men would come back for the boats.\nMeanwhile my son clutched his little bag of crystals and two small soft toys. His uncle and aunt tried to distract him with a card game but, by 8pm, he was holding his hands to his ears, begging us to turn off the radio \u2013 the emergency warnings were upsetting him so \u2013 and that\u2019s when I took him to bed.\nAbout 1am the RFS dropped the threat level to our area and, when in the morning the Live Traffic App informed us the road to Sydney had reopened, we threw our things into the car and fled.\nI feel guilty being so safe in Sydney, while the locals we left behind stay to defend their houses and their lives.\nPolitics has to change forever as a result of this summer because our country has \u2013 there is simply no turning back now. We, on Australia\u2019s east coast (and beyond) have seen what the consequences of not acting on climate change look like and it is terrifying.\nHow many people will have died and lost their houses when this immediate crisis has passed? How many farmers will have lost their livelihoods?\nHow many animals will have perished? How many species will have been brought closer to the brink of extinction? How many children will have lost their innocence?\nI am haunted by Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, a book I read only a year ago, never imagining how soon I would see photos in the Australian media of the post-apocalyptic world he described, of refugees fleeing blackened landscapes, parents leading their children through the smoke, carrying their belongings in their arms, hoping for rescue on military convoys.\nWe have no use for politicians who continue to pursue agendas that ignore the reality of our warming climate, that place our suffering planet in ever-greater jeopardy. It is time for a new generation of leaders to stand up.\n\u2022 Cynthia Banham is a Sydney-based author and journalist", "label": 0}, "text-551": {"text": "Peter Ridd Versus the Clowns of Reef Science\nTHERE is science, and then there is activism in the name of science.   How can we tell them apart: the activism versus the real science \u2013 and does it matter?  Some would argue that activism is more important than science, to ensure the protection of the environment.  After all, many would argue that economic interests often corrupted scientific findings, so some fitting-up of the evidence may sometimes be necessary.\n\u2018Noble cause corruption\u2019 is a term invented by the police to justify fitting-up people they know to be guilty.  This assumes that the means sometimes does justify the ends.   Could this even be the case in science \u2013 for example, to say that global warming is killing coral reefs to make a stronger case for action against climate change?\nThen there is pure make-belief, which is of more interest to some than evidence.\nIn the popular, animated Disney-movie Finding Nemo, which is a about a little clown fish finding his way back to the Great Barrier Reef, there are vegetarian sharks.  The inclusion of the vegetarian sharks cannot be to teach kids science, but perhaps to challenge traditional stereotypes \u2013 as well as entertain.\nThe movie Finding Nemo doesn\u2019t claim to be scientifically accurate.  But what does it mean to be scientific, anyway?\nBecause of the status associated with science, many individuals and organisations claim their work is scientific.  But what is a proper test for such a claim: that it can be described mathematically; that it has the endorsement of a government authority?\nScience is about evidence.  Another key distinguishing feature is that it is open to falsification \u2013 unlike faith, a scientific theory can always potentially be disproven.   So, the moment someone tells you that \u2018the science is settled\u2019 you should know that they are not about testing the evidence, but rather prosecuting an argument that may or may not have some truth to it.\nIt is twenty years ago that I first observed Great Barrier Reef activism up-close, back in 1998.   The public campaign began on 20th August when then Queensland Greens spokesperson and Senate candidate Drew Hutton issued a media release claiming the sugar industry was \u201chaving disastrous impacts on the marine environment\u201d.   This claim was based on the work of a scientist who had found what was claimed to be a highly toxic chemical \u2013 a dioxin \u2013 in dead dugongs.\nDugongs are real animals with a mermaid-like tail, that live in the ocean and feed on seagrass.  They are considered vulnerable to extinction, with one of the largest remaining populations inhabiting the warm waters of northern Australia.  The idea that these harmless creatures, more closely related to elephants than whales, could be slowly poisoned by sugarcane farming was truly horrific.\nInformation was being amassed by scientists to prove this point.\nI was told that in the meantime there was a need for urgent action by sugarcane farmers because the chemical found in the dugong was a dioxin, and that it was a result of farmers burning sugar cane that had been sprayed with the herbicide 2,4-D.\nNone of these allegations proved to be true.\nBut damage was inflicted on the reputation of the Queensland sugar industry.  This was in direct proportion to the success of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) membership drive, which also helped with fundraising for scientific research at that time.\nBack in 1998, my reputation was also damaged because I insisted that more evidence was needed before the sugar industry accepted responsibility for killing the dugongs.   In fact, I was not only condemned by activists for suggesting that the dioxin could be naturally occurring, but I was also condemned by the commercial fishing industry for explaining on radio that the dugongs had actually been drowned in fishing nets \u2013 that they didn\u2019t die from poisoning.\nThe scientist who first briefed me about the dioxin in the dugongs \u2013 with information that has since proven to be wrong \u2013 has enjoyed a successful career and is now a professorial research fellow at James Cook University.   Indeed, it has been my observation over the last twenty years that scientists who survive and thrive within the system are those who subscribe to activism, rather than those who care most about evidence.  Perhaps not surprisingly we now have a replication crisis in science.\nIt is the case that an increasing number of peer-reviewed scientific studies are impossible to reproduce on subsequent investigation, either by independent researchers or by the original researchers themselves.  Yet the reproducibility of experiments is an essential part of the scientific method; otherwise we are dealing with anecdote.\nThe replication crisis has been acknowledged in social psychology and increasingly in medicine more generally \u2013 but it is still denied in Environmental sciences especially climate science and Great Barrier Reef science.  Daring to question the veracity of the evidence was the beginning of the end for former reef scientist and James Cook University Professor Peter Ridd.\nIn two weeks\u2019, time Dr Ridd will be fronting the Federal Court after being fired by James Cook University for speaking-out very publicly against what might best be labelled as activism in reef science.  Dr Ridd has claimed that there is no quality assurance of Great Barrier Reef science \u2013 science that is arguably misused to secure billions of dollars of tax-payer funding for more and more research, which is arguably of dubious quality though it often makes for a good newspaper headline.\nThe university may argue that Ridd, as an employee of James Cook University, was damaging the reputation of the university when speaking out about the quality of the science; that he should have complied with their request to desist.\nDr Ridd will likely argue that there is a clause in his employment contract that gives him the right to speak out because he is an academic at a university \u2013 that this is his duty as a scientist who cares about evidence and the truth.\nI plan to be at the court case from Monday 12th November and cover the arguments at this blog.\nIn the meantime, I will begin posting background information, including snippets from my time as an employee of the Queensland Cane Growers Organisation Ltd.  During that six-year period from 1997 to 2003, I sat on various government taskforces with key activists from universities and environmental organisations and saw first-hand how activism is rewarded and scientific scepticism slowly drowned-out.   Of course, scepticism is critical to true science \u2013 as important as being able to reproduce the results from an experiment, and as critical as the principle of falsification.\nAs I see it, this court case \u2013 Peter Vincent Ridd versus James Cook University \u2013 is almost a last stand for the truth when it comes to reef science, least the clowns prevail.\nI\u2019m told it may all be lost on a technicality of employment law but I\u2019m hoping this is not the case.  I\u2019m hoping that the issue of scientific integrity will be given a proper hearing and that the right of a university professor at a publicly funded Australian university to speak truth to power will be defended. What Dr Ridd has to say may not be politically correct.  He has shown that the true demise is less of the Great Barrier Reef and more an erosion of the scientific method within our once great scientific institutions.", "label": 1}, "text-552": {"text": "Brits, stop comparing US and UK politics - they\u2019re more different than you think\nThere\u2019s nothing like a US presidential election cycle to prompt British pundits to think about Anglo-America as a \u201cthing\u201d. The UK is the 51st state in all but name, right? In reality, the similarities are more complex, and the differences are stark.\nYou can understand where the idea comes from. On both sides of the Atlantic 40 years of Reaganite and Thatcherite policies of financial deregulation, union emasculation, and a sanguine attitude to de-industrialisation, have sculpted Anglo-American society in similar ways: declining life expectancy among those whose communities destroyed as a consequence of these policies; and a surviving population that blames immigrants for their problems.\nThe political response to these economic and social conditions has been the election of two unsuitable philanderers, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. Both were initially resisted by party elites, who then abjectly surrendered. All dissenters have been purged. Their advisers are bizarre, comic book villain-types such as Stephen Miller and Dominic Cummings.\n\nHowever, the differences between Labour and the Democrats remain profound. The sudden revival of Joe Biden\u2019s fortunes is proof. Both parties are lazily described as being of the \u201cleft\u201d but really, America hasn\u2019t had a \u201cleft\u201d in the British sense as long as I\u2019ve been alive, which is a very long time.\nThe Labour party was from its inception a socialist party, and even though clause IV was taken out of the party\u2019s constitution the ideology of public ownership runs strong in the membership and recent leadership of the party. The \u201cleft\u201d wing of the US Democratic party embraces the legacy of Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal \u2013 but while his opponents in the 1930s called it \u201csocialism\u201d, it wasn\u2019t. Actual socialism never found a foothold in the US \u2013 perhaps because it was commonly called \u201cgodless socialism\u201d, especially in the south. America is a damned religious country. And Americans have traditionally had no problem with billionaires \u2013 perhaps because many of them fervently believe in the American myth that anyone can get rich if they work hard enough. The tragedy of Bernie Sanders is that he is a New Deal Democrat but insists on calling himself a socialist. You don\u2019t win in America using that language. The sudden revival of Biden\u2019s fortunes is proof.\nThen there\u2019s the governmental structures these political forces operate within. In Britain, the executive is housed in the legislature. Johnson leads a well-whipped majority and a prime minister with a majority of this size is in charge of an \u201celective dictatorship\u201d. In the US, the executive branch of government is separate from the legislature. This check on presidential power is profound, especially when, as is the case now, one of the branches of Congress is in the control of the opposition party.\nBarack Obama found that out when he tried to appoint Merrick Garland to the supreme court and the Republican-controlled Senate, which has the constitutional role of approving high court judges, would not give Garland the courtesy of a hearing. Trump found the limits to his power when the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and tied him up in impeachment.\nThe Senate, unlike the House of Lords, is not appointed. It is elected. Senators need to pander to voters successfully, unlike for example, Zac Goldsmith, who was elevated to the Lords \u2013 and returned to the cabinet \u2013 after losing his seat in the last election.\nThen there is money. In the US there is tons of it surrounding elections. Unimaginable sums, really: $6.5bn was spent on the 2016 presidential election across all races, with most of that money going on broadcast media advertising. There has always been money in American politics, but in the past decade it has grown to narco-trafficker levels of cash.\nIn 2010, the supreme court decided \u2013 in the case titled Citizens United v Federal Election Commission \u2013 that corporations had first amendment rights \u2013 free speech rights, like individuals \u2013 and putting restrictions on corporations giving money to air political advertisements in broadcast media was an infringement of that right. Since then the cash has flowed in and Americans are bombarded with paid political propaganda non stop.\nIn the UK there is no first amendment and there are firm restrictions on political advertising on television and radio. Party political broadcasts are strictly rationed and election campaigns take place within tightly defined windows. But there is a \u201cfree\u201d press. Conservative politicians don\u2019t need to raise money for advertising, they get it for free. Every day, outside every newsagent, there is a rack of blaring headlines trumpeting Conservative policies or viewpoints. They\u2019re not far off the billboards that line US highways. Decades of exposure to them, and it\u2019s no wonder that Brexit won.\nClearly, when it comes to propaganda channels, both countries have them, which brings me back to where I started: Anglo-America. Maybe some day Anglo-America will be a reality \u2013 after Brexit negotiations collapse, and the UK disintegrates, and England applies to become the 51st state. Then American politics and English politics will be the same. But that will not happen this electoral cycle or the next. The US is still a very, very different country.\n\u2022 Michael Goldfarb is the host of the podcast FRDH, First Rough Draft of History", "label": 0}, "text-553": {"text": "mainstream news media falls for false fijian sea-rise propaganda\nAn article by our Coalition chairman Barry Brill, just posted on WattsUpWithThat, corrects misleading mainstream media claims that the Fijian village Vunidogoloa has been forced to relocate by climate-caused rising seas.

If true, this was something of a betrayal of the younger James who argued that, as an activity that preoccupies a lot of the nation a lot of the time, television demands serious consideration. In an era when TV critics win the Pulitzer prize and Oscar-winning film directors make Netflix miniseries, the idea that TV is unserious seems anachronistic. Yet, for those of us who cast a similar critical eye over video games, it\u2019s a relatable stance.\nYou\u2019d think that, 40-odd years into the medium\u2019s existence, video games would be over this period of pained self-doubt. Yet many senior industry figures still insist that their games are essentially entertainment. In The Division 2, for example, you play a government agent fighting paramilitary organisations following a shutdown of the US government. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not making any political statements,\u201d Terry Spier, the game\u2019s creative director, told a reporter from the website Polygon before the game\u2019s release in March.\nGames often borrow politicised themes and aesthetics (October\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, for example, allows players to deploy white phosphorus, a chemical weapon prohibited under international law) in order to benefit from the frisson of political relevance. But developers often seem not to consider or contextualise those decisions. But can we really blame companies for claiming that their games are nothing more than a benign pastime when the mere choice of which online store will have exclusive rights can result in thousands of abusive messages (as happened in the case of the husband-and-wife development team who announced that their project Ooblets would be available through just one platform \u2013 Epic Store?)\nOf course, video games don\u2019t need be serious. Often they\u2019re at their best when, as in Untitled Goose Game, the surprise hit of 2019, they enable us to explore the absurd and wilfully silly. Arguably, in a medium that places primacy on the player\u2019s agency to move the story in directions of their own choosing, there\u2019s a case to be made that video games are a poor vehicle for a pointed narrative argument.\nAlso, when a publisher is spending tens of millions of dollars trying to attract the broadest possible audience, dividing that audience along political lines is a risk. Still, it\u2019s a question of ambition, or imagination. And in a medium with such tremendous, unique qualities, why not give it a try \u2013 especially when politicians remain so eager to politicise the medium regardless, as Donald Trump did in August, blaming video games (rather than guns) after the mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas?\nThen again, perhaps \u2019twas ever so. As James wrote in the introduction of Glued to the Box, a collection of his television reviews published in the Observer between 1979 and 1982: \u201cTelevision is simultaneously blamed, often by the same people, for worsening the world and for being powerless to change it.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change.\n1. Untitled Goose Game (PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox One, Switch)The tinkling and benign Debussy soundtrack belies the dark task at the heart of Untitled Goose Game: ruin what might otherwise be a perfectly pleasant day for the village in which you, a mean goose, reside. So you squawk, flap, peck and harass the villagers as you work your way down a series of to-do lists. Funny, well-crafted game-making.\n2. Disco Elysium(PC)While Disco Elysium is at its core a computerised Dungeons & Dragons campaign, its story and setting (you play as an alcoholic cop charged with solving a union-related killing in a working-class port neighbourhood) is about as far from fantasy-based swordplay as one can travel.

In simple terms, the Tasmanian independent was pursuing a bigger objective than repeal or no repeal: she wanted people off Manus Island and Nauru.\nLambie told the Senate on Wednesday she put a \u201cproposal\u201d to the government. She did not call it a deal.\nIn her telling, this proposal (details absent, sorry guys, national security) meant things would not go back to the way they had been before the medevac regime was legislated. After her conversations with Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton, Lambie told the chamber she was now \u201cmore than satisfied\u201d that the conditions were in place to allow for repeal of the medevac procedures.\nThe talk around parliament on Wednesday is Lambie emerged from the tortuous medevac tussle with a letter from Morrison indicating the government will pursue resettlement with New Zealand after the current deal with the United States is exhausted \u2013 but I haven\u2019t seen the letter.\nI am entirely confident Lambie has been pursuing the New Zealand resettlement option in her protracted talks with the government about medevac repeal, but the rest is speculative, and the government claims no deals have been made.\nStill, there is an obvious way to square this \u201cI\u2019ve got a deal, sort of\u201d/\u201cno deal\u201d circle.\nDespite appearing reluctant to pursue New Zealand\u2019s kind offer to resettle the asylum seekers Australia sent to moulder in offshore detention, the home affairs minister hasn\u2019t really ruled out doing that. The line has been that now is not the time.\nAssuming that New Zealand remains willing, perhaps a more convenient time to pursue resettlement will materialise soon. Perhaps the government signalled this to Lambie, or some other viable resettlement plan involving another country \u2013 a plan to slowly dismantle the life-force sapping apparatus of offshore detention. Not a deal so much, as a sharing of (as yet unannounced) government policy (if you will).\nMorrison gave a broad hint that this may well have been what happened on Wednesday. Asked would the government consider the New Zealand deal once the United States arrangement had been exhausted, Morrison said: \u201cThe government\u2019s policy is that we seek to resettle people who are on Nauru.\u201d\nOnly time will tell if this is a genuine, good faith commitment from the government, or a convenient and transitory bauble dangled before Lambie in order to shepherd her into doing exactly what the government wanted.\nBecause we need to emphasise that Morrison\u2019s immediate wants were great on Wednesday. He wanted an end to a medical evacuations regime that was imposed on his disintegrating government pre-election; and he wanted a political win. Just in case it\u2019s not obvious, securing a win was important after the abject debacle of the previous sitting week, where the prime minister was fending off a police investigation into one of his ministers, and Pauline Hanson had the last laugh on his union-busting bill.\nWhile I am hopeful, genuinely hopeful, that Lambie has helped focus Morrison\u2019s mind on the urgent imperative of dismantling the amoral mess of Australia\u2019s creation \u2013 the banishment of our fellow humans offshore in conditions that have generated an unconscionable crisis in the mental and physical health of asylum seekers \u2013 whether she has remains moot.\nThe repeal of medevac is also more than a setback. It is a shocker.\nMedevac wasn\u2019t imposed on the government because of a cheap bit of chamber theatrics. It was imposed on the government because the government was failing the people it put on Nauru and Manus; because there was a humanitarian disaster playing out on our watch.\nThat\u2019s why matters were taken out of the government\u2019s hands. That\u2019s why the new system was enacted: because people were ailing, and suffering, and dying, and there was no credible evidence the medevac system was creating significant problems.\nUnless Lambie has secured a water-tight commitment that all medical transfers now occur expeditiously and without fuss as the precondition of repealing the regime, the terrible suffering offshore will only intensify.\nThat thought is unbearable if you think of this cohort as fellow human beings to whom Australia owes a duty of care.\nRepealing medevac to speed up third-country resettlement is the working definition of a Faustian pact.\nThinking about it prompts intense moral discomfort. Witnessing it in the chamber was discomfiting in the extreme.\nIt seems to me entirely possible to have proper medical evacuation procedures for seriously ill people and, also, the prospect of ending the arbitrary indefinite detention of people exercising their rights under an international convention.\nThe fact these propositions are apparently in competition with one another is Australia\u2019s shame.", "label": 0}, "text-557": {"text": "Online grocery shopping hasn\u2019t taken off.

Bright-eyed, if not absolutely zealous, they spoke of tinned haricot beans as the future, and of fresh orange juice as (RIP) the past. After this, someone made a joke about scurvy, at which everyone laughed rather too loudly. But the moment swiftly passed. Our dinner \u2013 beef with roast potatoes and hispi cabbage \u2013 had begun arriving at our table in quantities generous enough that our talk had suddenly started to seem a bit ludicrous.\nOn the way home, I laughed about this: how we love a drama. If I could have remembered it, I would have hummed the theme to Survivors, the 70s TV show about a plague that has spread across the world thanks to air travel. But the next day, it was my turn to start worrying about vitamin tablets and shelf lives. At Ocado, Britain\u2019s biggest online supermarket, shares had apparently jumped thanks to the fact that so many customers were placing \u201cparticularly large\u201d orders. Delivery slots were selling out. Suddenly, I was receiving the message with zero distortion: basically, only a fool would risk having to go into a 14-day quarantine without ready supplies of \u2013 we\u2019re talking about Ocado here! \u2013 organic couscous and those new-fangled bags of frozen avocado I\u2019ve seen advertised.\nEver since, I\u2019ve found myself wondering whether, whatever else it achieves, Covid-19 will come to have a permanent effect on shopping habits. I think it will certainly lead to an increased interest in vegetarianism. But might it also succeed where Ocado, Tesco and others have seemingly failed, by getting more people to try online shopping, and thus to convince them that it isn\u2019t, after all, such a bad idea? For this \u2013 that it\u2019s a bad idea \u2013 is what a lot of people do indeed seem to think. A decade ago, it was thought that 40% of the grocery market would have moved online by 2025. Last month, however, one industry body revised this figure downwards to just 7.7% by 2024. Unlike the rest of the high street, growth at supermarkets lies not in online shopping, but in convenience stores, and discounters such as Lidl and Aldi, which do not deliver.\nNo one could be a pickier shopper than me. But buying online gives me the gift of time\nTo be honest, I was much more amazed by this fact than I was by the revelation that people I know are hoarding fusilli. No one could be a pickier shopper than me: I\u2019ve only to see a melon to sniff it. And yet, I always shop online now. There are still things I only buy in my local shops \u2013 croissants, cheese, salad, herbs \u2013 and our milk is delivered in glass bottles. For everything else, however, I get out my laptop. This saves me money \u2013 I make fewer impulse buys online \u2013 and it means, too, that I don\u2019t use my car for a short journey (to be as green as possible, I only book a delivery if the van is already in my area). Above all, it gives me the gift of time. I can order my shopping in hotel rooms when I\u2019m working away, or at home late at night, and this has changed my life to the point where bricks and mortar supermarkets have become almost alien to me. I can\u2019t seem to navigate them any more.\nEarlier this year, I walked around a Co-op, dazed and slightly confused, wondering where the nutmeg was, and longing all the while for my virtual basket. At the till, I kept having to run back for things \u2013 items my online account would have reminded me I needed, and which I was going to struggle to carry anyway. I was in Yorkshire, and the woman serving me was patient and lovely. But for all that I\u2019m a deracinated northerner, I found to my surprise that her accent was not much more comforting to me at this point in my life than another all-too-familiar sound: that of plastic boxes being humped from van to pavement.

Braddon voters are about to be hauled back to the ballot box for a third time in 14 months, following last year\u2019s state poll and a federal byelection in July. Even those motivated to lodge a pre-poll vote in a converted sports store appear disillusioned or indifferent about the options before them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like choosing between gonorrhoea and syphilis,\u201d says Tony Easton, a truck driver from the nearby town of Penguin who is voting early in case he has to work on election day. \u201cWhoever we vote for, we don\u2019t know how long they will be there.

Uniquely, Lyons was a Labor premier in the 1920s before becoming prime minister in the 1930s as leader of the United Australia party (the original model, precursor to the Liberals, long before Clive Palmer appropriated the name). Lacey leans Liberal, as much in antipathy to the alternative as enthusiasm for the government.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind who\u2019s in power as long as they manage the money and don\u2019t just go \u2026 getting the country into heaps more debt,\u201d he says.\nBut he prefers Scott Morrison\u2019s bloke-on-the-street persona to his predecessor, a common refrain in this part of the country. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a good job.

Left-leaning voters out to vote while their son is at school, the Arnolds don\u2019t care for Morrison, but doubt Shorten\u2019s electability.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a prime minister who ultimately is not likeable, people out there don\u2019t find him pleasant or agreeable and the party has backstabbing and infighting \u2026 but we\u2019ve got an opposition leader in Bill Shorten who people just can\u2019t see as prime minister and I think that is a stumbling block for the Labor party,\u201d Jason says.\nIf Labor want to get serious about winning an election they should let Albanese or Plibersek have a go.\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t have a problem with him \u2013 I like him and I think he\u2019s got good policies \u2013 [but] I think if they want to get serious about winning an election they should let Albanese or Plibersek have a go, [otherwise] Morrison has a better chance.\u201d\nBeyond personalities, the Arnolds believe Labor\u2019s emphasis on services, particularly increased support for healthcare and Tafe, speaks best to the needs of people in Braddon, where wages are lower and unemployment higher than the national median. The couple, whose son has special needs, particularly want to see a strengthening of the national disability insurance scheme, which they applaud in principle but believe was rushed and is under-resourced.\nFor Kayla, who is of black African heritage, election campaigns are a reminder of the social conservatism of her adopted home. She moved to north-west Tasmania from Adelaide six years ago and says she regularly encounters prejudice on the street that she links to sentiments voiced on the political right. \u201cI know the [Liberal party] say they are not, but they are quite racist,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t go out on my own without Jason because people are quite rude in this area.\u201d\nLater, she summarises: \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of disappointment with every election really. It\u2019s sad.\u201d\nAlong with the neighbouring electorate of Bass, centred on Launceston, Braddon is central to the Coalition\u2019s hopes of squeaking a third term in power. Most analyses mapping a potential path for the government back to power have found they need to win at least one, and probably both.\nBraddon takes in the regional cities of Devonport and Burnie in the east, King Island in Bass Strait and runs down the west coast through towns, farming land, some mining areas and the state\u2019s famed wilderness. Traditionally working class and largely rural, it was a Liberal stronghold for decades until the GST election of 1998, when it began to swing. While parts of Tasmania buzz with newfound confidence on the back of the tourist boom triggered by David Walsh\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art, the north-west has been slower to feel the benefits.\nThe Liberal party goes into this election with no lower house seats in Tasmania, having lost Braddon, Bass and Lyons in 2016. A few weeks ago, the prevailing wisdom among political observers was that if the swing was on to Labor nationally, the most likely scenario was that all three would remain with the ALP.\nThat view no longer necessarily holds. Both parties believe Braddon and Bass could be in play, a point underlined by the time and money the leaders have dedicated to them.\nWhat\u2019s changed? Answering that requires examining what happened three years ago. Lyons, a rural electorate covering more than half Tasmania, has traditionally been a Labor seat and its return to the ALP was not a great surprise, but the extent of the swing in the state\u2019s north and central regions was greater than predicted.\nIn hindsight, three factors stand out. The losing Liberals in Bass and Braddon, Andrew Nikolic and Brett Whiteley, were abrasive figures whose approach turned off some constituents. This was amplified in Bass by a well-executed campaign by GetUp against Nikolic, a member of the party\u2019s hard-right.\nTurnbull\u2019s prescription of corporate tax cuts to strengthen the economy did not go down well in a region where voters are most concerned about services and the cost-of-living. By comparison, at a time when Tasmania\u2019s public hospitals appeared under siege, Labor\u2019s so-called \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign on health spending was effective.\nThe question facing Labor at this election is whether it peaked in Tasmania in 2016 and, if so, how big a correction it should expect.\nThe member for Braddon is Justine Keay, a former Devonport city councillor and ALP staffer. She was less than two years into the job when she was forced to resign \u2013 like Lambie, she was found to be a British citizenship by descent \u2013 and recontest the seat. The byelection that followed was a replica of 2016, with the Liberals once again preselecting Whiteley, and Keay winning by effectively the same margin (she had a 0.1% swing in her favour).\nThere are some new variables this time out. Independent Craig Garland, a recreational fisherman who won more than 10% of the vote and directed preferences to Labor at the byelection, is now in what appears to be a race with Lambie and a third ALP representative for the state\u2019s final Senate seat. He has been replaced in the Braddon field by a long list of minor party and independent candidates, mostly from the right. It suggests Keay may need to lift her primary vote above the 36.7% she received last year to be safe.\nLiberal candidate Gavin Pearce, a farmer and RSL president in Wynyard, was a relative unknown in much of the electorate before the campaign. He was not made available to speak with Guardian Australia but told an ABC radio forum he was running because he supported a \u201cTasmanian way of life\u201d rooted in family and community.\nKeay\u2019s pitch focuses on her personal story as a mother of three young boys who wants a majority Labor government to improve health and education in the area. Speaking after a candidate forum in the town of Ulverstone at which Pearce was a late withdrawal, she says she believes concern about healthcare is biting with voters and that, contrary to the mood on the street in Burnie, people are becoming more positive about Labor as election day draws near.\n\u201cHealth is such a massive issue in this electorate,\u201d she says. \u201cI think for some people it\u2019s probably justifying them switching their vote this time around.\u201d\nIf Braddon is volatile, Bass is an explosive device waiting to go off in the face of a sitting MP. It is 18 years since it returned an incumbent to Canberra and it was the only electorate in the country to record swings of greater than 10 percentage points in both 2013 and 2016.\nLabor\u2019s Ross Hart, a former lawyer, holds the seat by 5.4%. But the sense of a fickle constituency ready to strike received a boost early in the campaign when the Australian Forest Products Association released a widely publicised poll that claimed the Liberals were leading 54-46, briefly pushing the government ahead in betting markets (the same happened in Braddon, despite the association having the Liberals up just 51-49).\nThe sense of momentum for the government has been maintained by newspaper reports based on selectively leaked government polling claiming Shorten is deeply unpopular in the region. But political observers say there is little evidence on the campaign trail that another wild swing is in the works.\nThe Liberal candidate for Bass is Bridget Archer, a farmer and the mayor of George Town, a small municipality north of Launceston that is traditionally Labor territory. In part, she is pinning her hopes on Launceston\u2019s improving economy and the injection of federal money for a city deal that will bring the university campus closer to town. Archer did not take up invitations to talk to Guardian Australia.\nHart believes healthcare is the major issue in the seat, particularly dissatisfaction with emergency care at Launceston general hospital, the only option in town for those needing urgent treatment. \u201cThe Liberals can\u2019t deny that the health system is under stress \u2013 we say it is in crisis \u2013 and it needs funding,\u201d he says. \u201cIrrespective of the suburb, it is health that comes up on every occasion. It is a priority across demographics.\u201d\nSisters Dani Ankin and Jessie Pengelly say they are particularly swayed by Shorten\u2019s promise to reduce childcare costs for families earning up to $174,000 a year. Ankin, a mother of two and the manager of a local Bras N Things store, says it would make a meaningful difference in their lives.\n\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s stupidly expensive and it makes it super hard,\u201d she says. \u201cI work full-time and my husband works full-time but if my mother-in-law didn\u2019t take our kids two days a week we couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nIt is enough to sway her vote, probably. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go for Labor, but it\u2019s weeks to go so who knows? At least they\u2019re focusing on working parents, not the rich.\u201d\nWayne Higgs, a former executive officer of Master Builders Tasmania, is headed the other way. He says he has watched the local economy change and recover in recent years, with some of the big industry of the past, such as forestry, mostly gone, but construction performing strongly.\nHe is dismayed by what he sees as a shift towards people expecting handouts the country can\u2019t afford and governments relenting, a situation he likens to parents giving kids lollies at the supermarket to keep them quiet without considering the eventual cost. A big fan of Turnbull, who he saw as a statesman, but turned off by Tony Abbott (\u201cwhat were they thinking?\u201d), he is slowly coming around to the idea of Morrison as a different kind of leader.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sort of down-homie, wants-to-be-accepted-as-a-run-of-the-mill sort of fellow [but] it\u2019s hard to tell from the picture you get in the media,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s he really like? I don\u2019t know. I think his heart\u2019s in the right place.\u201d\nFor anyone trying to read the tea leaves from this, the main message from Tasmania\u2019s pre-eminent election expert, Kevin Bonham, is: don\u2019t spend too much time using polling as a guide.\nHe says the idea Labor could lose Bass on a margin of more than 5% would seem unlikely \u2013 if it was not the seat of Bass.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tricky as there is not an obvious baseball bat issue this time, though there is some sense that Labor strategy is too Hobart-focused,\u201d he says, citing Liberal attacks and critical headlines in the north over an ALP pledge for $50m for a new convention centre at Mona.\n\u201cBut seat polls are rubbish. They\u2019re always unreliable and in Tasmania they have tended to skew Liberal at federal elections.

Instead, several cabinet ministers who are deemed by Downing Street to have performed poorly in recent months are likely to be shown the door.\nThose whose jobs are widely believed at Westminster to be under threat include the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox.\nBut Sajid Javid, who has clashed with Cummings, appears safe, with Rishi Sunak also left in place as chief secretary of the Treasury.\nThere had been fears that the shakeup would tip the gender balance around the cabinet table in favour of men \u2013 but No 10 sources insist the total number of women attending cabinet will not decline. They also claim the prime minister will promote talented backbenchers to more junior posts, creating a pool of candidates with enough experience to enter the cabinet in future.\n\u201cThe prime minister wants this reshuffle to set the foundations for government now and in the future,\u201d a No 10 source said. \u201cHe wants to promote a generation of talent that will be promoted further in the coming years. He will reward those MPs who have worked hard to deliver on this government\u2019s priorities to level up the whole country and deliver the change people voted for last year.\u201d\nThe new intake of MPs, many of them women, are likely to be brought into the most junior government posts in the coming days to cement the impression that Johnson is committed to gender equality.\nCummings has written extensively in the past about the need to overhaul the machinery of government, and there had been speculation about drastic changes, including an economics and business super-ministry to mastermind Johnson\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d plans.\nThese ideas appear to be off the table for the moment. Some senior Conservatives suggest Johnson may not have the appetite for the necessary upheaval. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like conflict at all,\u201d said one government source.\nBut others said the spending review, expected in summer or autumn, would be a more natural point to reshape Whitehall.

Plum jobs due to be filled include culture secretary, a job which Nicky Morgan made clear she would only do for a few months when Johnson handed her a peerage after the general election.\nJohnson is also expected to announce who will be the new HS2 minister \u2013 a new post created to ensure that Downing Street can exert a firm grip on the delivery of the mega-project \u2013 and who will oversee the COP26 climate conference.\nCox, who put his booming baritone to good use introducing Johnson at his leadership campaign launch, did little to dampen speculation that he would be removed from office on Wednesday. Asked at an Institute for Government event if he would be disappointed to leave his job, he said: \u201cIt has been an enormous privilege to do this job. But it is a decision for the prime minister.\u201d\nCox has been tipped to chair the government\u2019s review into the role of the judiciary, including the supreme court, and he suggested he would be willing to take on that role. He said the new constitutional commission would consider both the role of judicial review \u2013 which he described as the \u201cjudicialisation of politics\u201d \u2013 and the appointment of judges to the supreme court.\nThe Department for International Development appears to have escaped immediate annexation by Dominic Raab\u2019s Foreign Office, a move charities have warned strongly against. But with the prime minister\u2019s foreign policy adviser, the academic John Bew, understood to be conducting a review into Britain\u2019s post-Brexit role in the world, that change could yet come later this year.\nThe international development secretary, Alok Sharma, is expected to be promoted, while Brandon Lewis could be for the chop from his Home Office post. Party sources suggest Lewis\u2019s decision in 2018 to investigate Boris Johnson\u2019s comments on women in Islamic dress looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d is a mark against him.\nThey claim he was only appointed to the senior Home Office role in July last year because he had previously served as Tory party chairman. To get rid of him at that point would have looked \u201ctoo brutal\u201d as one of the first acts of the new prime minister, the source said.\nJohnson was cleared of any wrongdoing over his controversial Telegraph column and Tory MPs rallied around him, demanding an apology from Lewis for launching the investigation.

Now climate change could wreak havoc too. \nProf Michael Mahoney, of the University of Newcastle, has spent three decades studying the amphibians. \u201cIt\u2019s the cumulative impact,\u201d he says. \u201cYes there are some frogs that were greatly reduced because of the fungus. If they now face the added insult of climate change impacts, it just makes everything all that harder.\u201d\nTo make matters worse, Australia\u2019s 2016 national plan to reduce the impacts of the fungus speculated that climate change and warmer temperatures could also increase the vulnerability of amphibians to the disease.\nMahoney says all frogs have a different \u201ccritical thermal maximum\u201d, a temperature above which they die, so they have to find places to hide and stay cool and moist.\n\u201cThe problem then is, how many refuges are there? The effective habitat that\u2019s available is getting smaller and smaller. Can the frogs keep pace with current climate change? We don\u2019t quite know the answer to that.\u201d\nMahoney says some Australian frog species live in high elevation rainforests and cool temperate areas with a thermal maximum of 29C. \u201cAnything above that, and they die,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the last four to five years, there have been four or five days that have gone above 32C [in those areas].\u201d\nClimate change will have a slower impact than the fungus outbreak: \u201cIt will be a much more steady process of decline. That gives us more time to look at adaptation, but it\u2019s also frightening because people become complacent.\u201d\nDr Jodi Rowley, a frog expert and biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, says there are about 240 known frog species in Australia. However, it\u2019s estimated about 20% of all the likely frog species in Australia have not been named and described in scientific journals.\nShe said in south-east Asia \u201cdeforestation is happening faster than we can discover species in the forest\u201d and the same problem could be hitting frogs in Australia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s theoretically possible that same thing could happen due to climate change, even in Australia,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cWe also don\u2019t know how the fungus will change and interact with climate change. Because frogs are so influenced by temperature and humidity \u2013 like the fungus \u2013 in warm dry years they huddle together and transmit disease between themselves.\u201d\nDr Laura Brannelly, a conservation biologist at the University of Melbourne, studies how frogs cope with climate change and disease. \u201cFor frogs in particular, climate change is a real threat because they rely so much on water availability, and water patterns are changing across Australia particularly in regions like the Australian Alps,\u201d she says.\nFor example, the habitat of the endangered alpine tree frog, says Brannelly, has been hit by drought and reductions in snowfall. \u201cIf there\u2019s no snowfall, it messes with their breeding cycle. I suspect a lot of declines will be happening [in alpine regions] and climate change is a contributing factor.\n\u201cOne or two consecutive bad years of extreme drought could cause an entire small population to completely disappear, which is a huge worry for species on the brink.\u201d\nTabitha Rudin, of the University of Western Australia, is researching the crawling frog that is widespread across the southwest, an area, she says, that has seen a drop of about 19% in winter rainfall since the 1970s, with further declines predicted.\n\u201cSuch drying conditions pose a growing challenge for many amphibians, particularly for terrestrial-breeding species as they deposit their eggs on land rather than water and rely on consistent rainfall whilst embryos are developing.\u201d\nCrawling frogs are able to live in places with markedly different average annual rainfall, meaning even within the species some might be better adapted to drier climates than others.\nRudin is looking to see if a technique known as \u201cassisted gene flow\u201d could be used to help this species, and perhaps many others, by breeding to encourage tolerance for drier conditions.\nShe has already produced hybrid offspring in the laboratory with greater tolerance to drying conditions. \u201cWe now have to test whether this positive effect remains over multiple generations,\u201d she says. Rowley says a major problem for frogs is that there is comparatively little data about where they are, and so tracking changes caused by climate change or disease is hard.\nTo tackle this, she co-founded FrogID, a citizen science project that\u2019s trying to track frog locations by getting users to record their calls.\n\u201cPeople want to know what\u2019s going on out there with frogs and they notice changes, but the data just isn\u2019t there,\u201d she says. \u201cWe get lots of anecdotal stories from people who say they just don\u2019t hear them around any more.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-564": {"text": "Ripe for change: growing your own food means always picking it at the right time\nMost commercial fruit is picked underripe.

Farming means I don\u2019t have to have my choices dictated by perishability in a supermarket.\nFor instance, we have been picking our bananas and mangoes when they have reached maximum ripeness, which often means part of the bunch has been nibbled by some other critter first.

It\u2019s still the way I cook it for my kids \u2013 except now I pick the gourds when they are a little larger than a Sharpie marker. This makes them an entirely different vegetable.\nWhen they are picked with their yellow flower still attached, similar to a baby zucchini, they are tender with a satisfying crunch and require no peeling. All they need is a lick of heat from a smoking wok.\nThough this is hardly the only way they can be eaten, these tender young members of the cucurbit family have a curious aroma, reminiscent of fresh peanuts. They are just as delicious very lightly steamed and dipped into bagna cauda \u2013 garlic and anchovy whipped into a good quality new season olive oil.\nThe prettiest way I\u2019ve seen them served was by my mate Ben Devlin at his restaurant Pipit, paired with some fresh tiger striped peanuts which we also grow. Sadly, if you aren\u2019t growing it, it is almost near impossible to buy them young. So best to get growing!\nLuffa acutangula gourds make up a wide range of incredible vegetables.

Yet their call-to-action ignores the gap between how carbon taxes operate in theory and how governments implement them. North of the border, Canada\u2019s real-life experience with carbon taxes underscores this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, some background. Many economists including 2018 Nobel Prize-winner William Nordhaus have designed ideal carbon taxes, which reduce emissions while promoting economic growth\u2014but without considering how government interests affect implementation. Economists generally agree that an efficient carbon tax is characterized by (a) revenue neutrality, with all revenues used to reduce more costly harmful taxes, (b) substitution of existing regulations and (c) prohibition against subsidies to energy alternatives including renewable sources such as wind and solar power. But in reality, these criteria have never been achieved in practice.\n\nConsider the carbon tax levied by the Canadian federal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which went into effect January 1 (although several provinces already had their own carbon-pricing schemes).\n\nFirst, the federal tax is not revenue neutral, with only an estimated 90 per cent of total new revenues returned to taxpayers. And the revenues will not be used to reduce corporate or personal income tax rates, which impose much higher costs on the economy by discouraging investment, entrepreneurship and savings. Rather, the Trudeau government will issue lump-sum rebates to households based on income. Most analysis suggests that recycling carbon tax revenue in a lump-sum format will likely stimulate less economic activity than if that same revenue was used to lower other taxes. Nonetheless, Ottawa has chosen to rebate 90 per cent of the collected revenue in lump-sum payments.\n\nMoreover, Canada\u2019s federal carbon tax won\u2019t replace any existing regulations. Rather, the new tax will simply be added on top of existing regulations, which again, directly contradicts the textbook carbon tax design. If the Canadian federal and provincial governments repealed all other energy-related regulations including ethanol restrictions, the mandated coal phase-out, the Alberta oilsands emission cap, marine tanker bans, etc. and replaced them with a carbon tax, then it would be fair to call the result \u201ccost-effective.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t happened and seems implausible. In fact, the Canadian government is moving in the opposite direction, adding even more red tape (Ottawa\u2019s new vehicle emission standards, for example) on top of the carbon tax.\n\nFinally, economists repeatedly call for measures to prevent carbon leakage\u2014where firms reorganize their activities or relocate operations to avoid the carbon tax\u2014and to protect competitiveness. Many economists (including the authors of the WSJ op-ed) argue for a border carbon-adjustment system so imports would face a carbon tax and exports to countries without comparable carbon-pricing would be exempt from a carbon tax. Canada has not done this.\n\nIndeed, the federal carbon tax plan includes measures to mitigate competitiveness concerns for emissions intensive and trade exposed industries. However, the government\u2019s approach targets high-emitters, meaning that service and low-emitting manufacturers will pay more in energy costs as a result of the carbon tax.\n\nAnd crucially, imports to Canada now enjoy a new advantage over Canadian producers, since the federal plan does not include an import carbon tariff. To make matters worse, exporters unable to pass their extra carbon costs to world markets will likely see their competiveness wane since the federal carbon-pricing plan doesn\u2019t issue export rebates.\n\nClearly, Ottawa\u2019s carbon tax implementation should remind economists how the textbook carbon tax can operate in practice. Canada\u2019s carbon-pricing system violates many key principles of an efficient carbon-pricing model. And that\u2019s something economists and policymakers in Washington, including Democrats eyeing their party\u2019s nomination for 2020, should understand.", "label": 1}, "text-569": {"text": "Rapinoe and Pique give Bale a lesson in how to tackle murky world of politics\nIt is a fair guess that Gareth Bale, everyone\u2019s favourite top-knot idiot, did not rush from the pitch after Wales\u2019s match against Hungary on Tuesday to inquire how the prime minister got on in his TV debate with Jeremy Corbyn. Or, indeed, bother to ask if we had the same prime minister as last month, when Bale pronounced in an unguarded moment of candour: \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the prime minister is any more \u2026 I haven\u2019t got a clue \u2026 I follow the golf, that\u2019s about it.\u201d\nThat is, indeed, about it.

Others might yet make the podium.\nIt comes as a surprise, though it shouldn\u2019t, that famous people often do not know anything or anyone but their hairdresser or whoever it is looking after their property portfolio. They do not just live in another world; they are not sure the one they are in is real \u2013 or, in Bale\u2019s case, Real Madrid.\nThe Spanish media has not been too happy with Bale for a little while now but he managed to up his irritant factor when he let slip that he would rather play for Wales than the people who have made him ridiculously rich. Admirable loyalty to his roots, some would say \u2013 although his fame playing for his country has not spread to Baku, apparently.\nWhen Wales lobbed up in the Azerbaijan capital last week for a Euro 2020 qualifier, the translator assigned to the visiting team\u2019s press conferences did a bit of a Bale when she asked the manager, Ryan Giggs, \u201cWho is Gareth Bale?\u201d\nFair question. Who is this man who only football and golf knows? When the eminent Trinidadian Marxist, CLR James, asked the cricketing version of that question in Beyond A Boundary in 1963, he borrowed the famous quote from Rudyard Kipling, who asked \u201cwhat should they know of England who only England know\u201d? Or Wales.\nThe Baku translator got the sack, by the way, on the reasonable grounds that she might struggle to record faithfully anything to do with the Welsh team. Is it unreasonable to wonder if a similar punishment be handed out to Bale: say, refuse to let him vote in case he gets it horribly wrong, with not knowing that Boris Johnson has been squatting in 10 Downing Street for a few months. For those asking, Bale does actually speak Spanish \u2013 but he thinks Franco is still in charge.\nIn Madrid this week a footballer of similar distinction, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, has put together a new version of the Davis Cup, a brave experiment but something one might have expected of someone whose awareness of life away from the pitch has led him to the murky waters of politics more than once. Piqu\u00e9 is as proud of his Catalan heritage as Bale is of his Welshness but a little more in touch with what is going on around him.\nAs he told the Guardian in 2017 during the turmoil and violence that surrounded the referendum on Catalan independence: \u201cPolitics is a drag, but why shouldn\u2019t I express myself? I understand those players who don\u2019t want to say anything. We\u2019re footballers but we\u2019re people too. Why can a journalist or a mechanic express themselves but not a footballer?\u201d\nAs it happens, Piqu\u00e9 did not say which way he voted, although he does not talk like a separatist. But at least he talks. As does the magnificent Megan Rapinoe, who has helped USA win two World Cups and an Olympic gold medal while simultaneously and fearlessly expressing her disgust for Boris Johnson\u2019s fellow fool, Donald Trump.\nHer Wikipedia entry is hilarious. Apparently she is \u201cknown for her crafty style of play and activism\u201d. She speaks out with unfettered enthusiasm on LGBT issues, which ought not be considered unusual for a famous footballer but seems so to be. In the land of the free there is a home for the brave (sort of), as Rapinoe discovered when she knelt during her national anthem before a match in solidarity with the ostracised quarterback Colin Kaepernick. She has continued to use her position to make her case, most brilliantly with that angled spread of her arms after scoring as USA conquered the world again in France, and declaring that she and her teammates were not inclined to attend a victory reception at the sullied White House.\nShe is not alone. When the phenomenal Norwegian Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or last year, she had to contend with the crass intervention of a DJ called Martin Solveig, who asked her to twerk for the gathering. She gave him a polite \u201cno\u201d. Empowerment grows as it is watered.\nWe had at least come a little way forward from the awkward moment at the Australian Open in 2015 when a courtside commentator asked Eugenie Bouchard to \u201cdo a little twirl for us\u201d after she had won. She did it, bemused and laughing nervously. But the adverse reaction was widespread and unequivocal.\nAthletes, especially women, do get put in boxes.

One was taken by ambulance to hospital and subsequently died of Covid-19. But passengers were permitted to disembark and make their way home, including flying overseas, with warnings to self-isolate for 14 days.\nThe Australian reported on Wednesday that the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had told a gathering of state colleagues that ABF officials had erroneously advised NSW Health that the ship was low risk.\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Berejiklian said stopping transmission was a joint responsibility.\n\u201cEvery single agency needs to take responsibility for our borders,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a ship at a port, whether it\u2019s a planeload of people coming in from overseas.

But once NSW authorities had recognised that coronavirus was on the ship they had followed up on all of the passengers.\nShe said there was \u201cno action that NSW Health could have taken to prevent those people acquiring the disease\u201d, as they had acquired it on the ship.\nShe stressed that all passengers had been asked to self-isolate and that any cases identified were being \u201cringfenced\u201d.\nMost people began showing symptoms on the day of disembarkation and in subsequent days, she said, and NSW Health were working incredibly hard to limit onward transmission.\n\u201cIf we had had any suspicion, we would have deployed health teams,\u201d Chant said.\nThe department had contingency plans in place if an outbreak were identified.\n\u201cOf course, with hindsight, we would have acted differently, had we known we had a Covid-positive cruise ship.\u201d\nChant said she would look into reports that passengers were not given instructions to self-isolate when they disembarked, noting that this was an ABF responsibility as its officers processed passengers.\nShe defended allowing overseas passengers to fly home, as this was part of the agreed protocol to send them into self-isolation at home. Tracing of people sitting in rows around infected passengers was being conducted, she said.\nA week earlier Scott Morrison announced a 30-day ban on foreign cruise ships docking in Australia but the government made an exemption for four already on their way, including the Ruby Princess.\nThree of these ships have subsequently been found to be carrying people infected with Covid-19. Passengers were permitted to disembark with the standard advice that they should self-isolate for 14 days when they reached home.\nThe federal government has also issued new biosecurity orders.\nOutram provided what he said was the timeline of interactions between the ship and NSW Health.\nHe said ABF\u2019s responsibilities were confined to checking passports and ensuring that customs regulations were complied with, while the federal Department of Agriculture was responsible for biosecurity checks.\n\u201cOn the 17 March, 2020, NSW Health requested the following information from the Ruby Princess\u2019s senior doctor: estimates of arrival into Sydney, a log of details of passengers and crew presenting with fever or acute respiratory symptoms or both, travel histories, and whether tests were conducted and the results,\u201d Outram said.\n\u201cOn March 18, at 9.39am the senior doctor on the Ruby Princess notified the health department with the following: they had collected viral swabs for a few cases of febrile influenza, negative test, and that those people had been isolated. They also requested a transfer for other passengers who had unrelated illnesses.\u201d\n\u201cOn March 18 2020, at 5.17pm, they stated: \u2018The NSW Health panel assessed the Ruby Princess as not requiring onboard health assessment in Sydney.\u2019\u201d\nHe said NSW Health had requested that Ruby Princess send the 15 samples to a NSW Health lab for Covid-19 testing and to attach lab forms as required.\n\u201cNSW Health stated to the Ruby Princess, \u2018You are free to disembark tomorrow. However, in accordance with the Australian government guidance, all passengers must go into self-isolation for 14 days,\u2019\u201d Outram said.\nHe went on to say that on 18 March the Department of Agriculture was informed through Ruby Princess that a risk assessment had been conducted and that the ship was considered \u201clow risk\u201d. This is consistent with NSW Health\u2019s version of events.\n\u201cNSW Health decided not to board the vessel and attend, and that they had also given clearance for all passengers to disembark the vessel,\u201d Outram said. \u201cThat red light has just gone green. So, the vessel came into port on March 19. \n\u201cThey felt the vessel was low risk and there was no need to attend the vessel, but our six officers wore masks and gloves nonetheless.\u201d\nHe said protocols required any vessel coming into Australia\u2019s waters from overseas to provide 96 hours\u2019 notice for any disease. He said this had worked well for ships docking in Victoria and Western Australia, which had sent state health authorities to board them.\nLabor\u2019s spokeswoman on immigration, Kristina Keneally, said the Ruby Princess fiasco would prove to be a tipping point in Covid-19\u2019s spread in Australia.\n\u201cWe have now 133 passengers and counting from the Ruby Princess cruise ship that have tested positive for coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus cases account for 10% of the cases in NSW. And, quite tragically, there has already been one death.\u201d\nThis was despite the prime minister announcing there would be no more cruise ships arriving in Australia, she said.\n\u201cThey went into taxis and public transport, they interacted with friends and neighbours, they went to shops, they were allowed to travel across the country,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is gobsmacking that we are in this circumstance today. We need to ask, we need to demand to know how this happened and we need to ensure it does not happen again. The Australian government needs to get on top of this situation very quickly.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-572": {"text": "UK in danger of failing a generation, says child health study\nRising violence, drug use and mental health problems among young people in England mean society is in danger of \u201cfailing a generation\u201d, children\u2019s doctors have said.\nEnglish teenagers are increasingly likely to be injured in youth violence and the UK is lagging behind other European countries on measures including infant mortality, according to UK-wide research into the state of child health by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\nThe numbers of children in poverty, under child protection plans and being \u201clooked after\u201d have increased since its 2017 report, and progress on mental health among five- to 15-year-olds has stalled or reversed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty sight,\u201d said the president of the college, Prof Russell Viner. \u201cOn many vital measures we risk lagging behind other European countries. We\u2019re in danger of failing a generation if we don\u2019t turn this situation around. The government has made welcome commitments on childhood obesity and young people\u2019s mental health but we need to see delivery in these and other areas.\u201d\nSeparate figures from Childline revealed that in 2018-19 653 children under 11 contacted its freephone number with suicidal thoughts and feelings, an increase of 87% since 2015-16. Across all age groups it delivered 24,447 counselling sessions to young people overwhelmed by a sense of despair, an increase of a quarter over three years.\nEsther Rantzen, Childline\u2019s founder, said that when she launched the charity in 1986 most calls related to pain caused by someone else, including abuse, bullying or neglect.\n\u201cOver the last 10 years we have seen a rise in the number of children describing their feelings of such intense unhappiness that they tell Childline they want to end their own lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is deeply disturbing that we have reached a point where, on average, 67 children a day are receiving help for suicidal thoughts and feelings.\u201d\nThe royal college study claims to be the largest ever compilation of data on the health of babies, children and young people in the UK. It found that the health of children who live in deprived areas is largely worse than those in more prosperous places and that inequalities have widened since 2017. More children are undertaking unpaid care work, with the biggest increase in Scotland where the rate has almost doubled since 2017.\nThe college said the slide in conditions was rarely seen in developed countries and it blamed deep cuts to local authority budgets that are used to finance public health initiatives and community services.\nThe NSPCC said it was \u201cscandalous that progress in children\u2019s health is not improving and shameful that the most disadvantaged are seeing the biggest retreat\u201d.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe want every child to have the best start in life, regardless of their background, and tackling health inequalities is a priority for the government.\n\u201cEarly intervention is key and we are taking urgent steps to improve child health. We have launched the most ambitious plan in the world to cut childhood obesity by half by 2030, we are transforming children\u2019s mental health to treat to give 70,000 more children access to services by next year and we are improving maternity services.\u201d\nStabbings and injuries with sharp objects have risen in England among 15- to 19-year-olds since 2014, the study found. The likelihood of such an injury was unchanged in Wales and falling in Scotland and Northern Ireland. By contrast, the likelihood of a 17- to 19-year-old being harmed in a road traffic accident is falling across England, Wales and Scotland.\nThe figures reflect the rise in serious knife crime across England, with 47,000 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument recorded in England and Wales in 2018-19, the highest number since 2011. The danger from knives is increasing only in England and there have been decreases in incidents in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nThe report includes some signs of hope: the treatment of chronic medical conditions including asthma, diabetes and epilepsy is improving. Children in England, Wales and Scotland have healthier teeth, and smoking and consumption of alcohol is falling among children in England and Scotland, while teen pregnancies are falling across all four home nations.\nHowever, on infant mortality (children under one) the UK is fifth from bottom among 27 European countries. Among its recommendations to tackle the problem, the college said every child should receive a minimum of five mandatory contacts from a health visitor, universal midwifery visiting services should be offered for new mothers and the government should require the fortification of flour with folic acid.\n\u201cThe harsh reality is that in terms of health and wellbeing, children born in the UK are often worse off than those born in other comparably wealthy countries,\u201d said Dr Ronny Cheung, a clinical lead for the RCPCH and a co-author of the State of Child Heath 2020 report.\n\u201cThis is especially true if the child is from a less well-off background. Throughout the world, the number of babies dying in their first year has been steadily falling for decades, as incomes rise and mothers and children receive better healthcare. Yet UK infant mortality rates have stalled, and in England they actually got worse between 2016 and 2017. For a high-income nation such as ours, that should be a major wakeup call.\u201d\nThe college called for government investment to \u201cminimise social risk factors, early identification and intervention in those at risk, and a coordinated approach across public and social services including health, policing, social care and youth services.\u201d\nIt said this approach had proven successful in Scotland, where youth violence in 20- to 24-year-olds has decreased following the introduction of a violence reduction unit in 2005.

Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat-controlled House, had proposed a requirement for airlines to cut their planet-warming emissions in half by 2050, but that provision is not in the bill.\nThe House is expected to vote on the package on Friday. It also includes nearly $500bn in lending authority that one environment group, Friends of the Earth, called a \u201ccorporate slush fund with insufficient guardrails to protect workers, taxpayers and the climate\u201d.\nCongressional Republicans have accused Democrats of taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue climate policy. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week that Democrats were \u201cbargaining as usual\u201d with \u201ccounter-offers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels\u201d. Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis.\nIn the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside.\nAnnie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid.\n\u201cThe provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Petsonk said. \u201cPeople do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.\u201d The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes.\nThe bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve \u201csignificant discussions of green objectives\u201d.\n\u201cWas this a missed opportunity for climate?

The 13-year-old, wrapped in a coat and a woolen hat, has spent every Friday since December seated on a frigid bench outside the United Nations headquarters in New York City with signs warning of climate change\u2019s dire consequences.\nMost passersby, probably hardened to confronting New York street scenes, scurry past, eyes diverted downwards. But some mutter words of support, while the odd passing driver rolls down their window to offer a thumbs up.\nThere is media interest, too. On a recent Friday protest stint, a microphone was being pinned to a shivering Villasenor by an NBC crew. \u201cI stayed out there for four hours and I lost circulation in my toes for the first time,\u201d she said afterwards.\nCold weather in winter is routinely used by Donald Trump to disparage climate science \u2013 in January the president tweeted \u201cWouldn\u2019t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!\u201d \u2013 but Villasenor has experienced enough in her nascent years to grasp the scale of the threat.\nBe careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn\u2019t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!\nHer concern has driven her to help organize the first nationwide strikes by US school students over climate change, on 15 March. More than 100,000 young people are expected to skip school on the day and attend rallies demanding radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.\nVillasenor was born and raised in Davis, California, in the teeth of the state\u2019s fiercest drought in at least 1,200 years. She recalls seeing the dead and dying fish on the shores of nearby Folsom Lake as it dried up. In November, Davis was shrouded in a pall of smoke from record wildfires that obliterated the town of Paradise, 100 miles to the north.\n\u201cI have asthma so it was a very scary experience for me, I couldn\u2019t leave my house at all,\u201d Villasenor said. \u201cJust walking to the car would make my eyes sting. We rolled up towels and put them under the windows. A lot of my friends were going out in the smog and I was texting them to see if they were OK, as I\u2019m the mom of the group.\u201d\nVillasenor\u2019s family subsequently moved to New York, the switch hastened by concerns over her health due to the smoke. The young student then swiftly became an activist after reading how warming temperatures are making the western US far more prone to the sort of huge wildfires that menaced her hometown.\nAfter bouncing around a few youth-led climate groups, Villasenor struck up a rapport with fellow students Isra Hirsi, in Minnesota, and Haven Coleman, from Colorado. The trio set about creating Youth Climate Strike US, the first major American response to the recent mass school walkouts by European students frustrated by adults\u2019 sluggish response to climate change.\n\u201cMy generation knows that climate change will be the biggest problem we\u2019ll have to face,\u201d Villasenor said. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting that my generation has to push these leaders to take action. We aren\u2019t going to stop striking until some more laws are passed.\u201d\nThe American students preparing to join a global wave of school strikes on 15 March have been spurred by the actions of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swede who started taking every Friday off school to call for more rapid action by her country\u2019s leaders.\nIn a gently excoriating speech, Thunberg told governments at UN climate talks in December that \u201cYou say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\u201d \nThose under 20 years old have never known a world where the climate isn\u2019t rapidly heating, ensuring that their lifetimes will be spent in average temperatures never before experienced by humans.\nFor someone getting their first taste of politics it can be hard to digest that precious little has been done to avert a future of disastrous droughts, floods and storms since James Hansen, then of Nasa, delivered his landmark warning on climate change to Congress 30 years ago.\n\u201cIt was confusing at first because I expected politicians to be on to this, given what the scientists were saying,\u201d said Chelsea Li, a 17-year-old at Nathan Hale high school in Seattle and local strike organizer. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see any action. We are going to have to do the things the adults are too afraid to do because it\u2019s our futures we are fighting for.\u201d\nThe American strikers\u2019 challenge appears particularly steep. It\u2019s one thing protesting in the UK, where carbon dioxide emissions have plummeted to levels not seen since Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, or Germany, where the government has pledged to phase out all coal use within 20 years.\nIt\u2019s quite another to appeal to Donald Trump, who has called climate science an elaborate Chinese hoax and has overseen the dismantling of Obama-era efforts to reduce emissions from coal plants and vehicles.\nYouth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement and Zero Hour have seized the initiative from traditional green groups but have been met with the same unyielding political establishment. In a videoed exchange since parodied on Saturday Night Live, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the veteran Democrat, clasped her hands behind her back and patiently told a group of middle and high schoolers that they weren\u2019t yet able to vote for her and their demands on climate were unrealistic.\nThere was no way to pay for the Green New Deal, a plan to decarbonize the economy championed by progressives, according to Feinstein. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years,\u201d she said, an assurance alluding as much to political inertia as political experience. \n\u201cI think she was trying to dismiss me,\u201d said Isha Clarke, a 16-year-old from Oakland who had confronted Feinstein. \u201cI think she was making excuses for why she didn\u2019t have to listen to us. For older people there\u2019s no urgency, they are used to the system and compromising.\u201d\nClarke said the interaction with Feinstein was disappointing but the backlash was \u201camazing\u201d, with the California senator releasing and then dropping her own climate plan after it was savaged for being too weak. Feinstein also offered Clarke an internship, which she has yet to accept.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of tricky because you have to play the game to change it but I don\u2019t want it to cover up everything that happened,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cMost young people are very aware of climate change, a lot of them are super passionate about it but they don\u2019t have the resources to make their voices heard. They don\u2019t realize they have the power to create change.\u201d\nThat voice will be heard on 15 March when students forgo their classes in order to make a plea that they hope won\u2019t be dismissed as indulgent truancy. Parents and teachers may have to brace themselves for future walkouts.\n\u201cMy parents are very supportive, they understand my beliefs,\u201d said Villasenor, as she repositioned her placards for the cameras. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to have a future, then school won\u2019t matter any more.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-577": {"text": "Jaw-dropping sport moments of 2019: Coco Gauff beats Venus Williams\nCoco Gauff does not believe in fate. She says that fate is antithetical to her belief that she has the power to determine her own destiny at any given moment. However, few sporting moments in recent history have seemed as fateful as her wild Wimbledon breakthrough.\nOn one sleepy day in June Gauff was at home in Delray Beach, Florida, when she learned her qualifying wildcard had been accepted five days before the tournament began. She jumped on a plane the next day and eviscerated three opponents in a row to reach the main draw, escaping from the rugged grass courts of Roehampton with no practice on the surface. After the match a small group of journalists asked her whom she would like to face in her first grand slam main draw match.\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to be there,\u201d she said. \u201cI would love to share the court with Serena. I remember at Miami Open I was more disappointed that I lost the round before I got to play Venus than that I lost in general, because I really wanted to play her. But, if I play either one of them, that would be a dream come true.\u201d\nIt took less than 24 hours for Gauff\u2019s dream to come true; she was drawn against Venus Williams at the tournament that has defined the elder American\u2019s career. As Gauff walked down the Court One corridor and into the arena, disbelief circled her mind as she felt the presence of her idol behind her. Her nerves felt crippling. She stared resolutely at the floor so she would not lose her mind and she blasted her music at full volume to drown out the noise of an expectant crowd as she entered the court.\nVenus Williams is far from her grand slam-winning form of a decade ago. She is 39 and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome auto-immune disease has slowed her for half of her career. She finished the season ranked 52nd. Still it was astonishing to see a 15-year-old bridge the 24-year age gap and play with a boldness under pressure that belied her inexperience.\nGauff\u2019s service bombs crossed 116mph, she covered the court with long, fast strides that recalled Venus across the net and her backhand slotted winners at will.\nAs her nerves quickly gave way to her competitive fire, she punctuated her winning points with cries of \u201cc\u2019mon\u201d and she snatched the match on her terms. Gauff had entered the stadium with her head down but she left it with her chin to the sky and tears in her eyes as she secured a 6-4, 6-4 win.\nA young star toppling a veteran athlete is a common occurrence in the cyclical world of sport but even those who were not quite familiar with the story of the Williams sisters understood that this was something more. Venus and Serena Williams rose to the pinnacle of tennis when it was still seen as a white, country club sport. Their presence offered players such as Gauff, Naomi Osaka, Madison Keys and many others the belief that they could follow suit.\nGauff was born in 2004, a year after the Williams sisters had competed against each other in four consecutive grand slam finals while occupying the top two ranking spots. She knows the Williams sisters only as the champions they are today. The night before the first round, Gauff decided she was going to thank Venus for her unwitting contribution to her career regardless of the result. As tears welled in her eyes at the net, Gauff finally found the courage to stare into her idol\u2019s eyes: \u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without you.\u201d\nWhen an unknown player upsets a big name, it is normal for their profile to rise and their matches to attract more fans but Gauff became a global superstar overnight. She stepped on to the court for the next round against Magdalena Rybarikova and the British crowd supported her as if she were one of their own. Then 5.2 million British people tuned in to watch Gauff save two match points against Polona Hercog in their desperate, dramatic third-round match, a battle between a 313-ranked American and a Slovenian ranked 60th that somehow played out in front of a nerve-riddled Centre Court crowd.\nGauff\u2019s journey ended in the fourth round with a 6-3, 6-3 defeat by the eventual champion, Simona Halep, who had to reckon with her surging opponent and a crowd cheering loudly for her demise.\nHalep left the court certain that there will be more to come: \u201cIf she keeps going, she will be top-10 soon.\u201d\nBeyond the historic victory Gauff\u2019s story seemed to resonate because of the snippets of her personality she showed. She was poised and ambitious and her honesty was sincere. When she was asked after beating Williams what her plans were for the rest of the tournament, her response was clear: \u201cMy goal is to win it.\u201d\nIt was because of the barriers that Williams broke throughout her career and the way she normalised the sight of an ambitious black female tennis player that Gauff was able to make such a statement after the first grand slam match of her career and rather than being criticised across the world as arrogant, she stared back at a sea of impressed faces even more convinced that she will one day rise to the top.", "label": 0}, "text-578": {"text": "Extinction Rebellion and the end of days\nThe decision by counter-terrorism police to place Extinction Rebellion (XR) on a list of extremist groups was an abuse of the tools available to them (Starmer: police \u2018completely wrong\u2019 to label XR extremist, 14 January).

The world\u2019s livestock systems differ too significantly for them to be generalised, and doing so hinders the countries that are practising sustainable farming methods and which have an ambition to do even more.\nCompared with the mass-scale intensive systems in the US or Brazil, our livestock systems are unrecognisable. British farmers do not clear rainforest to make way for beef production. Our meat does not come from the ashes of the Amazon. We value our carbon sinks.\nGrazing cattle is the most sustainable way to use the 65% of UK farmland that is unsuitable for growing any other crop. It is hugely beneficial for the soil, helps lock up carbon, and is the best way to turn inedible grass into highly nutritious protein for a growing population to enjoy.\nWhat\u2019s more, British farmers have an ambition to become net zero by 2040. We want to lead the way in climate-friendly meat and dairy and pave the way for others to follow. This needs to be recognised.Stuart RobertsVice-president, NFU \n\u2022 Damian Carrington is correct that people in wealthy countries need to eat less meat. But to make targets for reductions in meat consumption is to put the cart before the horse. Excessive meat production is a symptom, not a cause, of the problem. Once we start to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, economic forces will reduce livestock numbers to sustainable levels because there will be increased demand for land for biomass, and because artificial fertilisers will almost certainly be in short supply.\nUntil that happens there is a danger that focusing on meat and livestock will be a futile distraction from the task at hand which is to put an end to the use of fossil fuels.

The loss of albedo as snow and ice melt away is reducing the flow of the Colorado by 9.5% for each 1C of warming, according to the research published in Science.\nThe world has heated up by about 1C since the pre-industrial era and is on course for an increase of more than 3C by the end of the century unless planet-warming emissions are drastically cut. For the Colorado this scenario means an \u201cincreasing risk of severe water shortages\u201d, the study states, with any increase in rainfall not likely to offset the loss in reflective snow.\nThe magnitude of the Colorado\u2019s decline as outlined in the Science paper is \u201ceye popping\u201d, according to Brad Udall, a senior scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on water supplies in the west who was not involved in the research.\n\u201cThis has important implications for water users and managers alike,\u201d Udall said. \u201cMore broadly, these results tell us that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as soon as we possible can.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wasted nearly 30 years bickering over the science. The science is crystal clear \u2013 we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions immediately.\u201d\nThe Colorado rises in the Rocky Mountains and slices through ranch lands and canyons, including the Grand Canyon, as it winds through the American west. It previously emptied into the Gulf of California in Mexico but now ends several miles shy of this due to the amount of water extraction for US agriculture and cities ranging from Denver to Tijuana.\nThe river\u2019s upper basin supplies water to about 40 million people and supports 16m jobs. It feeds the two largest water reserves in the US, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, with the latter supplying Las Vegas with almost all of its water.\nSnowpacks that last into late spring have historically fed streams that have nourished the Colorado River, as well as reducing the likelihood of major fires. As the climate heats up, the river is evaporating away and the risk of damaging wildfires is increasing.\nThe climate crisis is compounding existing threats to the river, which include intensive water pumping for agriculture, water use by urban areas and the threat of pollution from uranium mining. Lake Mead, the vast reservoir formed by the Hoover dam, has dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s.\nA 19-year drought that racked stretches of the river almost provoked the US government to impose mandatory cuts in water use from the river last year, only for seven western states to agree to voluntary reductions. The problems are set to become more severe, however, as the climate becomes hotter and drier at a time when demand for water from expanding cities in the American west increases.", "label": 0}, "text-581": {"text": "Ideas For Experts On Expertise Examining The Crisis Of Expertise\nWhen British MP Michael Gove said \u201cThe people of this country have had enough of experts\u201d he electrified the pro-Brexit voters and sent ripples of horror through the global club of those who advise decision-makers and opine on matters of fact and of policy.\nOne type of reaction to Gove\u2019s incendiary comment I saw at the Mercatus Centre at George Mason University in Virginia early last year, when Peter Boettke and others launched Escape from Democracy: The Role of Experts and the Public in Economic Policy,\u00a0 a book which proceeds from core premises such as the limits of knowledge, the self-interest of experts, and the need for more transparency in decision-making (further description appears at the end of this blog post).\nEighteen months on the ripples from Gove\u2019s comments have reached the University of Melbourne, which has in response convened a conference of, well, experts: \u201cA Crisis of Expertise: Legitimacy and the challenge of policymaking,\u201d to be held on February 15-16 at the Melbourne School of Government.\nNot surprisingly, Gove, Trump, climate change sceptics and other Deplorables all get a mention in the conference blurb, which then frames the key question in the highly limited juxtaposition of experts v populists:\n\u201c\u2026trust in experts and established institutions is in decline. The role and legitimacy of expertise in policymaking is increasingly being called into question.\nRecently, populist and anti-globalisation movements in a number of countries, and on both \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019, have achieved electoral success, in part by playing on these doubts and by rejecting the claims of experts to specialised knowledge and authority\u201d\nSome way or other, you can be sure the experts at this conference will be looking for way for their fellow experts to be restored to their rightful place at the right hand of decision-makers across the globe. But as my colleague Matthew Lesh last year pointed out in an excellent article for The Spectator, experts standing on their authority were in fact fuelling the so-called \u201cpopulist\u201d backlash, and ignoring the sometimes problematic track record of experts and the need for continued democratic control. He quoted Cambridge classics professor Paul Cartledge on the appropriate role of experts.\n\u201cWhen I charter a vessel or buy a passage on one, I leave it to the captain, the expert, to navigate it \u2013 but I decide where I want to go, not the captain.\u201d\nAnd of course John Roskam had this wonderful piece on the UK\u2019s \u201cMichael Fish moment\u201d (\u201cdefinitely no Hurricane on the way\u2026\u201d), and Daniel Wild in a piece for the IPA Review drew on the brilliant and intellectually brutal Nassim Nicholas Taleb to point on that the predictions of experts cannot be trusted as they have no \u201cskin in the game.\u201d More recently, Dr Jennifer Marohasy wrote to the Minister for the Environment, Josh Frydenberg MP, urging him to adopt the Red Team/Blue Team approach to ensure a transparent process of challenge to the assumptions of climate science and policy.\nTruth-seeking is, in any event, assisted by dialogue, including with one\u2019s perceived opponents. Hounding critics in the manner which has been seen in climate science, for instance, is not conducive either to legitimacy or to elucidating the facts, as Simon Breheny pointed out in a chapter from Climate Change: The Facts 2017, an excerpt of which appeared here).\nIn fairness, participants in the University of Melbourne conference won\u2019t necessarily be standing on Enlightenment notions of scientific notions of objectivity, empiricism or logic \u2013 this is a modern University after all.\u00a0 Presenters carry the baggage of the post-modern turn toward critical theory, so at least one key session will examine \u201cPublic institutions and social imaginaries in knowledge production\u201d and \u201cPolitics and discourses of expertise\u201d.

Which is all very well I suppose, but it does put him at one remove from the actual truth-claims bandied about in the domains in which the populist backlash has featured, such as climate policy, sovereignty, the nanny state, economics, immigration, and trade, to name but a few.\nIn one sense the Hayek quoting Austrians at Mercatus, the postmodernists at the University of Melbourne, and indeed \u201cpopulists\u201d, have some common ground: they agree that the argumentum ad verecundiam, the appeal to authority, is dead.

The figure has dropped steeply since 2015-16, when one in seven, or 13.7%, of all cases resulted in a charge or summons. New figures from the CPS show the number of cases referred by the police for charging decisions fell again by 32% in the year to September 2019.\nA recent report by the Crown Prosecution Service inspectorate concluded the service was not to blame for a precipitous drop in rape charges, but that the system \u2013 and in particular police-led investigations \u2013 was under-resourced to \u201cbreaking point\u201d.\nThis is disputed by a coalition of women\u2019s rights groups who launched a legal challenge against the CPS in September 2019.\nRape is a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute primarily because it comes down to the question of consent, often in a situation where there are only two people. In these cases evidence beyond the word of the victim or defendant is seen as central to building a strong case. Digital evidence requested from complainants, such as data, location information and texts from phones, is time-consuming to investigate. In 2018, more than half of all rape cases took more than 100 days to assign an outcome.\nA charge or summons is one of the steps in proceeding to a trial. Even if a suspect is charged a case may be dropped; and if it proceeds to court a conviction is less likely than it was a decade ago.\nCaelainn Barr and Alexandra Topping\n\u201cThis change [in policy] was brought about in secrecy and no one was told even afterwards,\u201d Kaufmann told the court.The changes were introduced from late 2016 after an internal review by the CPS\u2019s director of legal services, Gregor McGill, it was alleged.It resulted in refresher training of prosecutors that in effect abandoned the established policy of a what is known as a \u201cmerits-based approach\u201d to assessing whether to charge suspects in rape cases, Kaufmann said.\u201cThe easiest way to [raise the conviction rate],\u201d she added, \u201cis to whip out those cases that are a bit weaker \u2026 No one knew about it until it was leaked by an individual inside the CPS.\u201dThe consequence, Kaufmann said, was that some prosecutors reverted what had been known as the bookmakers\u2019 approach \u2013 guessing the probability of a jury convicting on the evidence and becoming reluctant to press ahead with more difficult rape cases.But the CPS, which successfully, resisted the challenge, argued that courts should not become \u201can arbiter of prosecutorial policy\u201d.In written submissions, lawyer for the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Max Hill QC, said it was factually wrong to allege that prosecutors have now adopted a \u201cbookmaker\u2019s test\u201d approach.The CPS maintained that the courts should dismiss the claim at this preliminary stage and not proceed to a full judicial review of the arguments.\u201cThere has not been a change in policy,\u201d Tom Little QC, for the DPP, told the court. \u201cThe fall on conviction rates is due to a far wider range of factors involving the police that are now the subject of a government review.\u201dRape victims who donated to the legal challenge, because they felt failed by the CPS, are set to see their donations go towards the institution\u2019s legal costs.\nThe CPS is pursuing legal costs against the women\u2019s rights\u2019 charity the End Violence Against Women Coalition, and asked for a request to cap legal costs to be denied. The CPS were awarded \u00a335,000 \u2013 \u00a341, 000 in legal costs by judges ruling on the request for a judicial review into the claims.\nThe coalition\u2019s director, Sarah Green, said: \u201cWe have no regrets about bringing this case. It was the right thing to do, and it was entirely necessary to challenge our justice system institutions when they are failing to keep women safe and deliver access to justice.\n\u201cWe have been approached by so many women who have been let down by the CPS as we prepared this case. We know there are really serious problems. But instead of working with us, the CPS chose to fight us.\n\u201cIt is a long way from the kind of leadership we need in our public institutions \u2026 The CPS is arguably failing to keep with the times on expectations for justice after sexual violence. The situation as it is cannot hold, it amounts to the effective decriminalisation of rape.\u201d\nThe charity received hundreds of donations, many for \u00a310 and \u00a320, via a crowd justice campaign ahead of the hearing. Many messages left with the donations were from women who said they had been raped but denied justice. One donor wrote: \u201cHaving been through the system myself and being failed on every level I so wish you every success.\u201d Under the anonymous donation of \u00a310, someone simply wrote: \u201cI never got justice.\u201d\nThe legal challenge also received \u00a310,000 from the family of Jill Saward, the Ealing rape victim who became a leading figure in the fight against sexual violence.\nHarriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, who supported the claim, said: \u201cWe are deeply, deeply disappointed that [the judges] didn\u2019t see there was a basis on which the case arguable.\n\u201cWe feel they were just not prepared to grapple with all the detail and ultimately they saw it as a factual dispute.

The letter was the last straw for Castle, who had lost the confidence and support of major stakeholders in the game, including her own board.\nBut how much of Castle\u2019s downfall was her own fault? How much was the product of a dysfunctional governance structure, which has never really made a full transition from the amateur era to the professional game?\nWhen the former Canterbury Bulldogs CEO took the reins at RA three years ago she inherited a mess. Australia\u2019s professional teams \u2013 the Wallabies and the four Super Rugby sides \u2013 could barely win a game between them. Television ratings and crowds were falling and there were simmering tensions over the axing of the Western Force.\nOn top of it all RA was heading towards the end of a lucrative broadcasting deal with long-time partner Fox Sports, worth $57m a year. Castle\u2019s task was to fix Australian rugby\u2019s deep-seated problems and then re-negotiate an even richer broadcasting deal. In retrospect, she never had a chance. Or did she?\nRA is the central power of Australian rugby, but its ability to create a cohesive and collaborative national administration is impeded by the game\u2019s federal model. Castle, a Kiwi, was creeping towards a more centralised system, similar to the one in New Zealand, but this was unpopular, particularly in the heartland states of NSW and Queensland.\nInstead of unifying the code, Australia\u2019s disaffected Super Rugby teams discussed amongst themselves the possibility of breaking away from RA and creating their own competition and negotiating their own broadcast deal. Maybe it was just all talk, but it reflected a growing sense of discontent with head-quarters at Moore Park.\nStakeholders found fault with Castle\u2019s handling of major issues such as the Israel Folau saga and the unsatisfactory performance of the Wallabies at the 2019 World Cup in Japan. A reported $9.4m loss did not engender confidence.\nEven when the coronavirus pandemic shut down rugby last month there seemed to be little sympathy for Castle in certain circles. It was clear that she would have to deliver a bumper broadcast deal to secure her position. In a supreme irony, Castle\u2019s greatest achievement as RA CEO also marked the beginning of the end of her reign.\nIt would hardly have surprised Fox Sports executives when Castle rejected their initial low offer of $20m a year for the broadcast rights, but what Castle did next would have stunned them. For the first time, Castle took the broadcast rights to open tender, hoping to create competitive tension between Fox Sports and another bidder, expected to be Optus.\nCastle\u2019s ballsy move prompted Fox Sports to make a much improved revised offer, but Castle did not seem to fully appreciate the magnitude of her victory and rejected it. It is understood Fox Sports executives breathed a huge sigh of relief and then withdrew from the bidding process. The pressure on Castle has mounted ever since, reaching a breaking point with the captains\u2019 call for change.\nThe RA board became increasingly uncertain Castle could deliver the outcomes the game needed to survive, especially in these challenging times. In her resignation statement Castle said it had been made clear to her that her departure would give the board the \u201cclear air\u201d they believed they needed.\nIt\u2019s a thankless job, the RA CEO. Just ask John O\u2019Neill, Gary Flowers, Bill Pulver and now Castle. It was a pity Castle left before the new Wallabies coaching team of Dave Rennie, Scott Wistemantel and Matt Taylor got to coach a game. If that team is successful, it will be Castle\u2019s lasting legacy.\nWho or what will replace Castle? There has been a lot of talk about reforming the governance system, but Australian rugby has more urgent matters to attend to, principally securing a new broadcast deal and resuming play once lockdown restrictions are eased.\nIt might take RA six months to find a new CEO. A few names that have been bandied around include Phil Kearns, David Gallop and Todd Greenberg.\nRA chairman Paul McLean, who claimed Castle was the victim of \u201cabhorrent bullying\u201d by her critics, has taken over as executive chairman for the immediate future and the board will meet on Monday to discuss where the game goes next.\nThere has already been speculation recently-appointed board member Peter Wiggs will act as an interim CEO. The founder of Archer Capital and chairman of Supercars, Wiggs has the requisite business acumen to steer the game through the broadcast re-negotiations and resumption of play.\nAnd after that? Perhaps Wiggs could be persuaded to take on the role of executive chairman permanently, becoming the Australian rugby equivalent of the NRL\u2019s Peter V\u2019landys.

These values, of course, suggest catastrophic human-caused global warming.\nTwo decades ago the Bureau replaced most of the manually-read mercury thermometers in its weather stations with electronic devices that could be read automatically \u2013 so since at least 1997 most of the temperature data has been collected by automatic weather stations (AWS).\nBefore this happened there was extensive testing of the devices \u2013 parallel studies at multiple site to ensure that measurements from the new weather stations tallied with measurements from the old liquid-in-glass thermometers.\nThere was even a report issued by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) entitled \u2018Instruments and Observing Methods\u2019 (Report No. 65) that explained because the modern electronic probes being installed across Australia reacted more quickly to second by second temperature changes, measurements from these devices need to be averaged over a one to ten-minute period to provide some measure of comparability with the original thermometers.  The same report also stated that the general-purpose operating range of the new Australian electronic weather stations was minus 60 to plus 60 degrees Celsius.\nThis all seems very sensible, well-documented, and presumably is now Bureau policy.\nExcept, this winter I have discovered none of this policy is actually being implemented.\nRather than averaging temperatures over one or ten minutes, the Bureau is entering one second extrema.  This would bias the minima downwards, and the maxima upwards.  Except that the Bureau is placing limits on how cold an individual weather station can record a temperature, so most of the bias is going to be upwards.\nI have known for some time that the Bureau remodel these recordings in the creation of the homogenised Australian Climate Observations Reference Network \u2013 Surface Air Temperatures (ACORN-SAT), which is subsequently incorporated into HadCRUT, which is used to inform the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Nevertheless, I naively thought that the \u2018raw data\u2019 was mostly good data.  But now I am even sceptical of this.\nAs someone who values data above most else \u2013 this is a stomach-churning revelation.\nIndeed, it could be that the last 20-years of temperature recordings by the Bureau will be found not fit for purpose, and will eventually need to be discarded.

This paper provides Montana-specific climate information to help educate lawmakers so they can craft the best possible climate-related policies on behalf of the people of Montana.\nThere has been no recent acceleration in Montana\u2019s modest long-term temperature rise. In fact, just the opposite has happened, as Montana temperatures have been dropping significantly in recent years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) keeps detailed temperature records for Montana and the rest of the nation dating back to 1895. A warming trend in Montana was already underway in 1895, even though this was before the advent of coal-fired power plants and SUVs.\nNOAA temperature records show a modest warming trend has occurred in Montana since 1895, at a pace of 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. (See Figure 4 on p. 10.) Since 2005, when NOAA\u2019s most accurate and advanced temperature-gathering stations became operational in Montana and the rest of the nation, Montana temperatures have been falling at a pace of 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. (See Figure 5 on p. 10.) It is counterfactual to claim humans are causing a recent increase, or any increase at all, in recent Montana temperatures.\nMontana carbon dioxide emissions contribute very little to national and global emissions and virtually nothing to global temperature. Only eight states emit fewer total CO2 emissions than Montana, and Montana produces less than 2 percent of total U.S. CO2 emissions. According to calculations included in the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research climate models, immediately eliminating all Montana CO2 emissions would lower expected global temperature by only approximately 0.003 degrees C by the year 2100, an amount too small to be measured or noticed.\nBullock\u2019s executive order claimed that \u201cclimate change poses a serious threat to Montana\u2019s natural resources, public health, communities, and economy.\u201d To support this assertion, the executive order cites a publication titled\u00a02017 Montana Climate Assessment\u00a0(MCA).

According to universities\u2019 own data, students with mental health problems are having to wait up to 12 weeks for counselling and support \u2013 longer than a standard university term.

They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown.\nHowever, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term.\nTheir findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts.

Oil producers have called a truce in their price war.\nBut reneging on green commitments now only stores up future problems, and will hasten climate breakdown, scientists have warned, and any respite from rising emissions caused by the crisis will be only temporary. All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before vital UN climate talks aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track.\nThe UN and the UK government have been forced to delay the talks, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called nationally determined contributions in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so.

At the worst, had I created a person who would be born just to watch the world end?\nPerhaps, I thought, I have made a terrible mistake.\nSitting 600km away in Melbourne as I write this, where the sky is blue and people come and go about their daily life, it\u2019s hard to convey the intensity of living in the middle of a long-running disaster. The world narrows. Your ability to think critically evaporates.\nNew daily rituals emerge \u2013 wake up, check the fire warnings, check the air quality reading. Get out of bed, check the air purifier. Next, wash brown smoky water out of clothing or animals that have left the sanctuary of the house for any period of time.\nThen go about your day, trapped inside, always with one eye on the live stream. Your social life reduces to rushing from your car inside a friend\u2019s house where you look at the live stream together while externalising your shared internal monolog of \u201cWe are not OK. The world is not OK.\u201d\nThat next day, at the ultrasound, there was no heartbeat.\nBeing pregnant in a climate emergency is an existential challenge. Having a miscarriage in the epicentre of a climate disaster is a logistical one. Canberra is housing thousands of climate refugees \u2013 pressuring an already fragile public health system.\nOur hospital rooms are full of smoke. MRIs and other machines are non-functional, their smoke alarms prohibiting them from working.\nAs a public health researcher, people wrote to me to tell me how as they were put under anaesthetic they coughed from the smoke that has made its way into all of the city\u2019s operating rooms. About closing their eyes as the drugs kicked in knowing a surgeon was about to cut them open while smoke swirled around the room.\nIn a state of acute stress, and now acute grief, I had to problem-solve my way out of a disaster zone and into safe medical care. It is a sign of my privilege that I managed to do that. That when the airport reopened I could make it to friends in Melbourne. And those friends could get me access to private healthcare within 24 hours.\nThis a privilege many do not have. Sociologist Ulrich Beck wrote that smog is the great equaliser; none of us can escape it. But smog, and smoke, do not affect us equally.\nIn a matter of weeks Canberra \u2013 a city known for its crisp sunny skies and eucalyptus smell \u2013 has shown us how every aspect of climate change disproportionately impacts those who have the least social and economic resources. The city has air inequity, where those with high incomes can purchase thousand-dollar air purifiers, while those who do not sit in their homes marinating in particulate counts that are known to be beyond hazardous. And where people like me can choose not to have surgery in a smoke-filled room, while others are giving birth to babies whose first breath will choke them.\nI don\u2019t know what I will do from here, whether having lived on the frontlines of climate collapse will mean I choose to not get pregnant again.\nI know it has changed me. It has changed us all \u2013 those who have seen the fires, lost homes or breathed toxic air for weeks and months on end. It has turned an abstract fear into a concrete reality. Shown us how climate change will alter even the most mundane aspects of our lives, from our morning rituals to whether we can leave our own homes.\nThat our infrastructure and systems are more fragile than we would like to believe, and if we choose to parent we will have prepare our children to survive in a very different world while we ourselves try to understand how it is changing.\nGemma Carey is a researcher at the University of New South Wales.

It follows a rise in concern about the escalating ecological emergency, which last week resulted in millions of people taking part in a global climate strike.\nSarah Lunnon, from Extinction Rebellion UK, said: \u201cWe hope that world leaders understand that the climate and ecological emergency means that the rules must change \u2026 business as usual is destroying our planet\u2019s capacity to sustain life; humanity faces a growing risk of societal collapse in 10-20 years due to mass starvation, migration and war.\u201d\nShe said \u201cmore rhetoric\u201d from politicians and world leaders would not help. \u201cThat is why we have been left with no other choice but to shut down capital cities to raise the alarm. The collapse of our climate and ecosystems has already begun, and is in fact accelerating beyond predictions.\u201d\nIn April thousands of peaceful protesters held key sites across London for two weeks, pushing the environmental crisis to the top of the political agenda and contributing to parliament declaring a climate emergency.\nExtinction Rebellion says its three demands of government: to tell the truth about the ecological emergency; halt biodiversity loss and reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and set up a citizens assembly on climate and ecological justice, have not been met.\nFor October\u2019s action, organisers say XR has built \u201ca movement of movements\u201d, with animal rights activists, faith groups, medics and peace and anti-war groups joining the protests.\nIn a statement, XR said: \u201cIt is expected that thousands more ordinary citizens \u2013 with parents, builders, footballers, doctors, teachers, musicians, scientists, CEOs, farmers, with other movements aligned to the cause \u2013 will join and peacefully block more than 11 key areas until Extinction Rebellion\u2019s demands, for truth, action and a democracy fit for purpose, are met.\u201d\nA Metropolitan police spokesperson said on Monday the force was aware of the planned protests and policing would be \u201cappropriate and proportionate\u201d.\nUnder XR\u2019s plans, released on Monday, activists said they planned to block two bridges, Westminster and Lambeth, as well as several roads in and around Westminster.\nAnimal rights activists announced last month they planned to block Smithfield Market, the biggest meat market in the UK, as part of the October protests.", "label": 0}, "text-598": {"text": "The Week in TV: Game of Thrones; Climate Change: The Facts; Earth from Space and more \u2013 review\nGame of Thrones (Sky Atlantic/Now TV)Climate Change: The Facts BBC One | iPlayerEarth from Space BBC One | iPlayerBack to Life BBC Three/One | iPlayerTrust Me BBC One | iPlayerChimerica Channel 4 | All 4\nSo we have a new date for our diaries, to split the nation once more between those howling bereft anguish and those who wish it would all just go away: 20 May is now going to be Threxit day, the day Game of Thrones finally departs our screens.\nWhether you\u2019re a diehard fan or not, you can\u2019t really deny that it has been part of our on-off national conversation for the last eight years or so, even more so than Harry Potter the previous decade; and, if you happen to live in Ulster, Iceland or Croatia, it will even have brought a grin to your local finances. It has made fantasy, that spoddiest of jester genres, acceptable (because it wasn\u2019t really about that, ever, just power-politics limned in a simpler medieval brutality); shown that women can be powerful without somehow having to be hobbled with niceness: perhaps, above all, reclaimed television\u2019s vital and urgent power, aided immensely by the franchised dreck of cinematic \u201cblockbusters\u201d, so spawning an exodus of screenwriting, directing, acting talent back to the living room.\nThis final series opener thus had a lot to live up to. It disappointed some, with its perceived failure to move things significantly forward: personally, I was delighted, as, after a nearly two-year hiatus, it gave us all a chance to remind ourselves precisely where we were. At Winterfell was where we were, barnacled in rime or covered in furs, though there have to be new definitions of intensity of \u201ccold\u201d to fully convey Sansa\u2019s pass-agg mien on having to welcome Daenerys. The Wall has been breached, a dragon has been recruited to the undead Walkers, and all is set for a quite stupendous battle, possibly episode four or so, to rival, in scope and quite possibly in actual budget, the Normandy invasion.\nIn all this, it was a grand opener, shot through with dark humour and the occasional tendresse. It all got a little briefly Hollywood with the dragon-ride over Iceland\u2019s striated mad beauties, and my knee jiggled in sympathy with Thrones purists who must have gag-reflexed when came a dragon-snort, half-love, half-jealousy, at Dany and Jon\u2019s waterfall-clinch, but still\u2026 and Jon!\nJon Snow had a happy episode! Not only did he get to ride a dragon, and find out he was not a \u201cbastard\u201d (in the proper sense of the word rather than simply someone who carves you up on the motorway); but, even better, he\u2019s actually heir to the Iron Throne. Good episode for Jon. (If bad news for his putative love life, but then again, 20 May is coming, and if you can\u2019t shag your aunt before you die\u2026 one thing that particularly separates this from Lord of the Rings is its insistence on twincest and the like). And for us. I particularly loved what was surely a back-reference to the one misstep the casting directors have made, shoehorning in Ed Sheeran at the height of his unaccountable fame just because he was (unaccountably) famous, to act very badly as a soldier. As Bronn gossips in his naked frolicking, after the war with Daenerys that \u201cboy Eddie... the ginger... came back with his face burned off\u201d. These casting supremos know how to retro-suckerpunch.\nMore of Iceland, little of it good though, in a simply superb exposition of Climate Change: The Facts. My, after his brief and ongoing Netflix sojourn, Attenborough\u2019s really been allowed to take off the gloves, hasn\u2019t he? No wonder, after 30 years of his trying to tell us all of this, politely thirled both by his love of the BBC and their absurd insistence on \u201cbalance\u201d.\nYet balance was what the many sharp scientists, most of whom have led the way in this, attempted throughout to show in this one-off (in many senses). Their language was always couched with \u201ccoulds\u201d and \u201call indicators suggests\u201d, as they told a quite simple horror story of, essentially, how our last chance to combat global warming has had the legs cut from under it by the recent deforestation of a third of global woodland for palm-oil growth, and the near-certain climatic tipping points this is entirely likely to engender. It was left to David Attenborough to quietly expound on how that immensely careful use of language by the least alarmist of scientists has been the very thing that has allowed politicians, oil companies, climate-change deniers, a tissue-thin excuse to delay. This was immense, and I do rather wish he\u2019d taken the gloves off 30 years back.\nWe had (blessedly briefly) old footage of Lord Lawson of Winterfell, apparently only him, again and again, telling us essentially that even if the world did get warmer it was a good thing because, said this gentleman who used to keep his hands tight on our Treasury\u2019s windpipe, it would mean fewer people dying of cold.\nThere\u2019s still time, was the message, in both this programme and in Earth from Space, something I\u2019d thought might be a bit gimmicky but turned out to be cloyingly watchable. We watched, rapt, as cameras from space zoomed in on elephants, individual seals, hippo-paths; importantly, though, on the interconnectedness of tiny planetary currents, oceanic and other. As Chiwetel Ejiofor nicely noted in this first (of four) he voices, we thought we were going looking into space; we are ending up learning a now-crucial lot about our planet. He had nicely prosaic hints as to ways forward, to gainsay, for instance, the destruction of half the world\u2019s wildlife in 80 years. Eat all the food we buy. Avoid air-freighted food. Avoid beef and sheep, because they fart. This is something we can do, now.\nBack to Life, set in Hythe with a fat sprinkling of Dungeness, has something of the same flavour of Don\u2019t Forget the Driver, in what may be termed the new genre of sadcom, but a very different premise.

So far, so very tense, for the first of four, and I for one Trust It, even if you might never trust late-night wards again.\nIn Chimerica, Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s so far splendid adaptation of her own play, we get a killer line at the start of the first (of four) which sums up much of what will follow. \u201cShe [a protesting woman] wants to know what happens after you get a dream of democracy,\u201d asks a translator, for a photographer in Tiananmen Square, 1989. \u201cWe know what China is dreaming of. What is America dreaming of?\u201d\nThe gung-ho snapper moves on from Pentax to digital Canon, and moves on from global fame, having snapped the man who stood against the tanks in the square, to ignominy. He adulterates a picture in Syria, today, for greater impact in a global half-hour news cycle, in a post-Trump, post-truth world. Obviously, it\u2019s the very worst thing he could have done, braving the war zones but playing right into the prez\u2019s tiny hands.

She teams up with a special aide to the president of the United States and a scientist who has thus far managed to escape the efforts to eliminate him. Collectively running but a few steps ahead of shadowy killers, they piece together the plot while dropping fact after fact of real climate science presented by\u00a0Dennis Avery\u00a0and\u00a0Fred Singer, among others.\nHalf of the characters in the book are real people, whom Fernandez quotes continuously to make sure she has the science right \u2013 and indeed she does. She begins with intriguing descriptions of the deaths of two scientists and a politician involved in a major Senate hearing on climate change.\nFord gets her first real case at the behest of a politician\u2019s widow who is certain her husband\u2019s death was not a suicide as reported in the press. Ford begins by investigating that death and others, managing to place in each investigation technical questions whose answers expose the falsity, if not absurdity, of the human-caused global warming premise. Each fact in each discussion or interrogation builds upon the next as would an excellent high school teacher explaining physics to his or her class.\nFord traces the cabal back to the\u00a0Earth Summit of 1992, where\u00a0Maurice Strong, a Canadian billionaire who got rich on oil before promoting \u201csustainability,\u201d attempted to make sure others could not prosper. Al Gore was his lieutenant, assuming command of the Agenda 21 plan after Strong\u2019s death. The plan, though not a treaty, was signed at the Earth Summit by 178 countries and eventually introduced as Executive Order 12852 by President Bill Clinton.\nOne of Ford\u2019s interrogations uncovered the fact that the\u00a0Chicago Climate Exchange, established in 2010 to trade carbon credits, netted Gore and his partners at\u00a0Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars when they invested in more than 40 companies that benefited from the folly of cap and trade.\nThe work of the two murdered scientists crossed paths with the infamous\u00a0Climatic Research Unit\u00a0(CRU), where Phil Jones was caught falsifying climate data and\u00a0Michael Mann\u00a0is shown to eliminate data in order to construct his\u00a0hockey stick sham; Fernandez\u2019s characters explain all of this with precision and simplicity. The average reader may not get as big a kick out of Fernandez\u2019s references as I did, given my friendship with so many of the real scientists. I found the casual manner of her recital of Dennis Avery\u2019s work wonderful. To quote Fernandez:\nDennis Avery had compelling scientific evidence that the sun played a key role in climate change along with cloud formations and shifts in the ocean, concluding that reducing fossil fuel use would have no discernible effect on rising temperatures.\nIt will likely come as a surprise to readers that mathematical models claiming to show increasing temperatures due to man\u2019s activities do not consider that the sun plays any significant role.\nWhat Max Ford\u2019s conversations do not explain about global warming, she learns from publications such as\u00a0The Wall Street Journal. There she quotes extensively from articles such as\u00a0Bret Stephens\u2019\u00a0stating that global warming is a cottage industry whose survival is dependent on being believed through mindless repetition of things nearly true with recurring dramatic crises requiring drastic solutions.\nOne of the delights of this truly \u201chistorical novel\u201d is its short chapters, which enable the reader to take a breath and decompress from the action. At the same time, Fernandez develops her characters exceptionally well \u2026 and makes it difficult for male readers not to develop a crush on heroine Max Ford. This is a wonderfully educational and exciting read.", "label": 1}, "text-600": {"text": "Climate breakdown 'is increasing violence against women'\nClimate breakdown and the global crisis of environmental degradation are increasing violence against women and girls, while gender-based exploitation is in turn hampering our ability to tackle the crises, a major report has concluded.\nAttempts to repair environmental degradation and adapt to climate breakdown, particularly in poorer countries, are failing, and resources are being wasted because they do not take gender inequality and the effects on women and girls into account.\nCampaigners called for governments and institutions to take note, saying that the impacts on women and girls must be at the heart of any viable strategies on the climate and ecology.\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) carried out what is understood to be the biggest and most comprehensive study yet of the issue, taking two years and involving more than 1,000 sources of research.\n\u201cWe found gender-based violence to be pervasive, and there is enough clear evidence to suggest that climate change is increasing gender-based violence,\u201d said Cate Owren, a lead author of the report, published on Wednesday. \u201cAs environmental degradation and stress on ecosystems increases, that in turn creates scarcity and stress for people, and the evidence shows that, where environmental pressures increase, gender-based violence increases.\u201d\nSix in 10 respondents to a survey by IUCN, with more than 300 responses from organisations around the world, said they had observed gender-based violence among female environmental rights defenders, environmental migrants and refugees, and in areas where environmental crimes and environmental degradation were taking place. More than 80 case studies clearly showing such links were uncovered as part of the research.\nGender-based violence includes domestic violence, sexual assault and rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage and child marriage, as well as other forms of the exploitation of women. The report found human trafficking rises in areas where the natural environment is under stress, and links between gender-based violence and environmental crimes such as wildlife poaching and illegal resource extraction.\n\u201cGender-based violence is one of the most pervasive but least talked-about barriers that face us in conservation and climate work,\u201d said Owern. \u201cWe need to take the blinders off, and pay this concerted attention.\u201d\nOwren found abundant examples of the close links between gender-based violence and the exploitation of women and girls, and the competition for resources engendered by the impacts of global heating and our destruction of the natural environment. For instance, sexual abuse was found in the illegal fishing industry in south-east Asia, and in eastern and southern Africa fishermen reportedly refused to sell fish to women if they did not engage in sex. The illegal logging and charcoal trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo is linked to sexual exploitation, and in Colombia and Peru illegal mines are strongly associated with an increase in sex trafficking.\nThere have also been numerous examples of gender-based violence directed against environmental defenders and activists, who try to stop the destruction or degradation of their land, natural resources and communities. Sexual violence is used to suppress them, undermine their status within the community and discourage others from coming forward.\nYet few projects that are aimed at conservation and improving the environment, or tackling the climate crisis, display any recognition of these issues, according to the report. \nGlobal heating puts pressure on resources, as extreme weather, including heatwaves, droughts, floods and fiercer storms, grows more frequent and devastating. In most parts of the world, women are already disadvantaged and lack land rights and legal rights, so are vulnerable to exploitation. When the additional stresses caused by the climate crises bite, they are the first to be targeted. For instance, in some communities, young girls are married off as early as possible when the family faces hardship exacerbated by the climate. Globally, about 12 million more young girls are thought to have been married off after increasing natural disasters, and weather related disasters have been shown to increase sexual trafficking by 20-30%.\nWomen and girls are also burdened with tasks such as drawing water and finding firewood, which are becoming more scarce in many areas under the ecological impact of our scramble for resources, and which expose them to further dangers of violence.\nGrethel Aguilar, acting director-general of the IUCN, said: \u201cEnvironmental degradation now affects our lives in ways that are becoming impossible to ignore, from food to jobs to security. This study shows that the damage humanity is inflicting on nature is also fuelling violence against women around the world \u2013 a link that has so far been largely overlooked.\u201d\nAt the UN climate conference in Madrid last December, governments were criticised by campaigners for ignoring the plight of women and children and the threats they face. \nSome governments are moving to put action for women and girls into their climate and development policies, and the UN in Madrid moved to include a gender action plan as part of the climate negotiations. Campaigners and some countries are hoping for even greater focus on the issue at the crunch UN climate talks in November, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow.\nThe UK\u2019s department for international development said it was already factoring in gender issues in climate change funding, including a large-scale study on violence against women and girls during the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, where about three quarters of women and girls who had been in a relationship experienced violence at the hands of their partner. A spokesperson said: \u201cWomen and girls can be disproportionately affected by climate change. This is why we\u2019re spending UK aid on helping to promote gender equality, as well as leading the fight against climate change.\u201d\nBob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in writing the report, said: \u201cThis report highlights the complex but clear link between growing climate change impacts and violence against women and girls. \nHe pointed to the role that female campaigners were playing in bringing the world\u2019s attention to the problems. \u201cWhen we see the inspiring leadership of female activists like Greta Thunberg, we should recognise that the lives and livelihoods of women and girls around the world are particularly threatened by climate change,\u201d said Ward. \u201cThe empowerment of women and girls and their protection from the direct and indirect consequences of climate change must lie at the heart of the just transition to zero-carbon and climate-resilient societies.\u201d\nThe report also provided a timely reminder that \u201cconcerted action to tackle inequality can unlock new opportunities for climate action and women\u2019s empowerment\u201d, added Mary Robinson, chair of The Elders. \u201cWe need to recognise the unequal effects of the climate crisis on women, but also that women\u2019s participation brings with it creative and sustainable solutions to both the climate emergency and social injustices.

It means that by 2050 plastic will be responsible for up to 13% of the total \u201ccarbon budget\u201d \u2013 equivalent to 615 coal-fired power plants \u2013 says the research published on Thursday.\nThe contribution of plastic production and disposal to climate change has been largely hidden, say the authors of the report by the Center for International Environmental Law, which estimates the greenhouse gas footprint of plastic from the cradle to the grave for the first time.\nWhile plastic pollution in the oceans has become a high-profile concern, the effect on climate change of the ubiquitous use of plastic has not been a focus.\n\u201cAfter the extraction of fossil fuels to produce plastic, the carbon footprint of a material which has become ubiquitous across the globe continues through the refining process, and on well past its useful life as a drinks bottle or plastic bag, through the way it is disposed of and the plastic afterlife,\u201d the report says.\nThe authors say disposable plastic found in packaging and fast-moving consumer goods forms the largest and fastest-growing segment of the plastic economy.\nThey are calling for urgent action to stem production and flow of throwaway plastic.\n\u201cAt current levels, greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C,\u201d the report says.\n\u201cWith the petrochemical and plastic industries planning a massive expansion in production, the problem is on track to get much worse.\u201d\nThe key actions which the authors say are required are:\n\u2022 Immediately end the production and use of single-use, disposable plastic.\n\u2022 Stop development of new oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure.\n\u2022 Foster the transition to zero-waste communities.\n\u2022 Implement a system where polluters pay for the impact of their products \u2013 known as extended producer responsibility.\n\u201cPlastic is one of the most ubiquitous materials in the economy and among the most pervasive and persistent pollutants on Earth,\u201d say the authors. \u201cIt has become an inescapable part of the material world, flowing constantly through the human experience in everything from plastic bottles, bags, food packaging, and clothing to prosthetics, car parts, and construction materials.\u201d\nThrowaway plastic packaging makes up 40% of the demand for plastic, fuelling a boom in production from 2m tonnes in the 1950s to 380m tonnes in 2015. By the end of 2015, 8.3bn metric tonnes of plastic had been produced \u2013 two-thirds of which has been released into the environment and remains there.\n\u201cPackaging is one of the most problematic types of plastic waste, as it is typically designed for single use, ubiquitous in trash, and extremely difficult to recycle. A constant increase in the use of flexible and multilayered packaging has been adding challenges to collection, separation, and recycling,\u201d the researchers said.\nForty per cent of plastic packaging waste is disposed of at sanitary landfills, 14% goes to incineration facilities and 14% is collected for recycling. Incineration creates the most CO2 emissions among the plastic waste management methods.\nNearly all plastic \u2013 99% \u2013 is made from fossil fuels.\nRefining the material is the most greenhouse gas intensive part of the plastic lifecycle, and major expansions in the US and elsewhere will accelerate climate change, the report says.\nA Shell ethane cracker being constructed in Pennsylvania could emit up to 2.25m tonnes of CO2 each year and a new ethylene plant at ExxonMobil\u2019s refinery in Baytown, Texas, could release up to 1.4m tonnes. The annual emissions from just these two new facilities would be equal to adding almost 800,000 cars to the road, the report says.\nIn 2019 the lifecycle of global plastic production \u2013 from extraction to disposal \u2013 was equivalent to the impact on the climate of 189 500MW coal-fired power stations. By 2050, the report predicts, the global plastic footprint will be equivalent to 615 coal plants running at full capacity.\n\u201cPlastic is among the most significant and rapidly growing sources of industrial greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d the report says. \u201cEmissions from plastic emerge not only from the production and manufacture of plastic itself, but from every stage in the plastic lifecycle \u2013 from the extraction and transport of the fossil fuels that are the primary feedstocks for plastic, to refining and manufacturing, to waste management, to the plastic that enters the environment.\u201d\nCarroll Muffett, one of the authors, said: \u201cIt has long been clear that plastic threatens the global environment and puts human health at risk. This report demonstrates that plastic, like the rest of the fossil economy, is putting the climate at risk as well.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-605": {"text": "Bureau\u2019s Report Beyond Belief\nThe release of the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s internal review only underlines the need for a transparent parliamentary inquiry into the manipulation of temperature data, according to free market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs.\nThe Bureau\u2019s investigations claims that Goulburn and Thredbo were the only sites where temperature records had been affected by the inability of some Bureau Automatic Weather Stations to read low temperatures.\n\u201cThe Bureau claims to have a network of 695 automatic weather stations across Australia, are they seriously suggesting the only two that have issues are the two that I raised?\u201d said Dr Jennifer Marohasy, Senior Fellow at the IPA.\n\u201cThis is a vindication of our own investigations. The Bureau has now acknowledged that it had inadvertently set limits on how cold temperatures could be recorded at Goulburn and Thredbo,\u201d said Dr Marohasy.\nAccording to the report published last week, the wrong smart card readers were inserted into the Goulburn weather station in September 2002, and into the Thredbo weather station in May 2007. So, for a period of nearly 15 years there has been a limit on how cold temperatures can be recorded at Goulburn, and for nearly 10 years at Thredbo.\nJohn Roskam, Executive Director at the IPA said, \u201cThe Bureau has now acknowledged that for many years temperature readings have been wrong for at least two weather stations.\u00a0The Bureau\u2019s claim that of its 695 automatic weather stations the only two at which there were problems were by coincidence the two identified by Dr Jennifer Marohasy makes the Bureau a scientific and statistical laughing stock \u2013 the chances of this happening are approximately 1 in 120,000.\u201d\n\u201cThe only way to determine what\u2019s wrong at the Bureau of Meteorology is for the Turnbull government to initiate a full parliamentary review into every aspect of how the Bureau has been recording and publicly reporting temperature data,\u201d said Mr Roskam.\nDr Jennifer Marohasy is editor of the IPA\u2019s new book Climate Change: The Facts 2017, which includes a number of chapters on homogenisation and manipulation of temperature data.\nClimate Change: The Facts 2017 has now sold out several times over.

Analytics, the Ryder Cup and the lessons for other sports\nThere is a scene in Moneyball, the story of how the Oakland A\u2019s defied a tiny budget to come close to reaching the 2002 World Series, that neatly encapsulates the friction between gnarly, gum-chewing scouts and the newer wave of analysts who seek truths in spreadsheets.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t put a team together with a computer,\u201d the A\u2019s scouting director, Grady Fuson, scoffs at the general manager, Billy Beane, who has begun deep-mining data to find undervalued \u2013 and thus cheap \u2013 players. \u201cBaseball isn\u2019t just numbers. It isn\u2019t science \u2026 there are intangibles that only baseball people understand.\u201d Beane\u2019s terse response? \u201cAdapt or die.\u201d\nTimes have changed \u2013 a bit \u2013 since Michael Lewis wrote Moneyball but many in sport still prefer to trust their gut over any algorithm. Which is why a tweet last week from Thomas Bj\u00f8rn, Europe\u2019s 2018 Ryder Cup captain, was so unusual. After linking to a piece titled \u201cHow analytics helped reclaim the Ryder Cup\u201d, written by Blake Wooster of the golf consultancy 15th Club, an enthusiastic Bj\u00f8rn wrote \u201cStick to the plan!!! These guys played a vital role. Thanks for your hard work.\u201d\nBj\u00f8rn, it turned out, had embraced data and analytics as \u201ca useful addition to his toolbox\u201d shortly after being named captain in December 2016, when he asked 15th Club whether he should pick two, three or four wildcards. The answer? Four. Because the data showed wildcards tend to perform better than those who qualify in the last couple of automatic spots. And so began a relationship that culminated in Europe\u2019s thumping 17\u00bd \u2013 10\u00bd victory over USA in September.\nAnalytics also helped Bj\u00f8rn answer tricky questions such as how important is experience versus form in the Ryder Cup, and which factors help determine success in foursomes and fourballs. They also reassured him that picking Sergio Garc\u00eda as a wildcard made sense because the Spaniard\u2019s underlying performance was better than his bare results implied.\n15th Club\u2019s influence continued in Versailles, with analysts suggesting the ideal fourballs and foursomes pairings for every player based on the format, their strengths, and the course layout \u2013 which included the strong recommendation Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood should play together. Crucially they also had enough of Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s ear to reassure him and his vice-captains to \u201cstick to the plan\u201d\u2019 on the first morning when Europe were about to go 3-1 down and were considering last-minute changes to the afternoon foursomes.\nAs Wooster relates: \u201cThis was a critical moment, and one where all those months spent establishing relationships and trust came to the fore. We knew the foursomes was a very different format and our statistical simulations gave us a high level of confidence the afternoon would be ours.\u201d Bj\u00f8rn listened and stuck to the plan. Europe won the session 4-0 and never looked back.\nSuch insight and influence is rare. Analytics in sport is increasingly mainstream \u2013 even Match of the Day shows expected goals \u2013 yet organisations guard even minor insights like diamonds. True, back in the day Sam Allardyce hailed his \u201cfantastic four\u201d metrics at Bolton, including the realisation that inswinging corners were much more successful than outswingers. Most teams, however, prefer to stay schtum.\nAnyone who has read another Lewis book, The Undoing Project, will understand how hard it can be for outsiders to convince old pros to embrace new ideas. The first chapter outlines howthe Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, a man smart enough to build statistical models to predict performances of pro basketball players, led the Rockets to the third-best record of the 30 NBA teams in his decade in charge. Yet as Morey admitted to Lewis, \u201cthere\u2019s an intense feeling among basketball people that I don\u2019t belong \u2013 they remain silent during periods of success and pop up when they sense weakness\u201d.\nAs Lewis relates, when the Rockets headed into the 2015 Western Conference finals, the former Olympic dream team player Charles Barkley dismissed Morey and analytics as \u201ccrap\u201d, telling viewers: \u201cAll these guys who run these organisations who talk about analytics have one thing in common. They\u2019re a bunch of guys who ain\u2019t never played the game and they never got the girls in high school.\u201d\nThere are plenty of Barkleys out there. So how were 15th Club able to make such a difference? Much of it was down to Bj\u00f8rn, who encouraged rigorous and open discussion and, despite being a golf professional for 25 years, was intrigued by fresh ideas. But Wooster\u2019s team also understood that, having failed to make an impact when part of Team Europe at Hazeltine in 2016, they had to forge deeper friendships and better understand when to intervene. As he came to realise: \u201cThe strength of your models is really just one part of the jigsaw \u2013 it is as much about emotional intelligence as analytical expertise.\u201d\nThis speaks to a wider point. The best teams know the choice between art and science is a false one. It is a combination of the two that works best, along with the mindset to be open to new ideas, whether they come from someone with 30 years in the trenches or a PhD in advanced algebra.\nIncidentally this is something Beane has long recognised. Despite his differences with Fuson over analytics, he recognised the scout\u2019s unique talents when he brought him back to Oakland to be his special assistant in 2010.", "label": 0}, "text-607": {"text": "Last month, U.S. Rep. David McKinley (R-WV) hosted an unbiased climate change panel discussion in Fairmont, W.V. Experts from both sides of the climate debate participated without restrictions of any kind.\nMcKinley\u2019s open-minded approach is one that should be copied across the United States. Considering what\u2019s at stake \u2014 a human-induced eco-collapse if former Vice President Al Gore and his allies are correct, or, if skeptics are right, a waste of billions of dollars and the loss of millions of jobs as we experiment with a switch away from hydrocarbon fuels to alternative energy sources \u2014 the risks are too high to do anything less.\nNo matter what Gore and 350.org founder Bill McKibben tell us, experts in the field know that climate science is highly immature. We are in a period of \u201cnegative discovery,\u201d in that the more we learn about climate, the more we realize we do not know. Rather than \u201cremove the doubt,\u201d as Gore tells us should be done, we must recognize the doubt in this, arguably the most complex science ever tackled.\nThe confidence expressed by Gore, McKibben and President Barack Obama that mankind is definitely causing dangerous climate change is a consequence of a belief in what professors Chris Essex (University of Western Ontario) and Ross McKitrick (University of Guelph, Ontario) call the \u201cDoctrine of Certainty.\u201d This doctrine is \u201ca collection of now familiar assertions about climate that are to be accepted without question\u201d (Taken by Storm, 2007).\nEssex and McKitrick explain, \u201cBut the Doctrine is not true. Each assertion is either manifestly false or the claim to know is false. Climate is one of the most challenging open problems in modern science. Some knowledgeable scientists believe that the climate problem can never be solved.\u201d\nCreating rational public policy in the face of such uncertainty is challenging. It is therefore important that America\u2019s climate and energy experts are able to speak out without fear of retribution or sanction, regardless of their points of view. We want climate and energy policies to be based on rigorous science, economics and engineering, coupled with common sense and compassion for our fellow man, not political ideology or vested commercial interests.\nSadly, the exact opposite is the case today. Emotions run high as the climate debate has become intensely polarized. Implications of bias and vested financial interests, as well as logical fallacies (errors in reasoning), have taken the place of meaningful consideration of the facts. Many leading scientists therefore remain silent if their views are not politically correct.\nWe must clean up the climate change debate to make it easier for experts to participate. In particular, media and politicians should strive to avoid the logical fallacies that are distracting the public from thinking about the issue constructively. Here are some of the fallacies that must be purged from the discussion:\nl Ad Hominem (discredit the man, instead of the idea): By calling those with whom he disagrees \u201cclimate deniers\u201d, Gore commits a logical fallacy often used to equate those who question the causes of climate change with Holocaust deniers. No one is denying that climate changes; only the causes are in dispute.\nl \u201cClimate change denier\u201d is also a \u2018thought-terminating clich\u00e9.\u2019\nl Guilt by association: That a specific viewpoint is promoted by the \u201creligious right\u201d or the \u201cloony left\u201d is irrelevant. A position is either correct or not, or unknown, independent of the affiliations of the presenter.\nl Straw man (arguments based on misrepresentation of an opponent\u2019s position): Republicans are not \u201canti-science.\u201d Neither are Democrats. If they were, they would never fly in an airplane, use cellphones or take vitamins. They simply disagree with each other about the causes of climate change. Climate always changes on planets with atmospheres.\nWe need politicians and media to help the stage for an effective discussion of this, one of the most important issues of our time, by avoiding these logical traps. Rep McKinley has led the way. Let\u2019s hope other leaders soon follow.\nWhat do you think?\n[First published in The Gazette.]", "label": 1}, "text-608": {"text": "Trouble brewing: climate change to cause 'dramatic' beer shortages\nTrouble is brewing for the world\u2019s beer drinkers, with climate change set to cause \u201cdramatic\u201d price spikes and supply shortages, according to new research.\nExtreme heatwaves and droughts will increasingly damage the global barley crop, meaning a common ingredient of the world\u2019s favourite alcoholic beverage will become scarcer. Key brewing nations are forecast to be among the worst hit, including Belgium, the Czech Republic and Ireland.\nThe researchers said that compared with life-threatening impacts of global warming such as the floods and storms faced by millions, a beer shortage may seem relatively unimportant. But they said it would affect the quality of life of many people.\n\u201cThere is little doubt that for millions of people around the world, the climate impacts on beer availability and price will add insult to injury,\u201d said Prof Dabo Guan at the University of East Anglia, one of the research team. \u201cThere is something fundamental in the cross-cultural appreciation of beer.\n\u201cIf you still want to still have a couple of pints of beer while you watch the football, then climate change [action] is the only way out. This is the key message.\u201d\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Plants, used climate models to examine the impact of extreme weather on barley yields over the next 80 years. The team then used economic models to estimate the impact on beer supply and price in different nations.\nIf carbon emissions are not curbed, the analysis found that beer consumption will fall by about a third in Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic. In the UK, a quarter fewer pints would be sunk, with 14% fewer bottles being opened in the US.\nIn China, now the world\u2019s biggest beer consumer, consumption is forecast to fall by 9%. In Australia, just 7% fewer cold ones would be downed, partly because it is one of few places where climate change may make barley growing easier in some regions. Globally, the cut would be 16%.\nEven in the best-case climate scenario, with rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gases, beers drunk in Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic would fall between 9% and 13%, with similar drops in Canada and Germany.\nLooking at the impact on price, the research found that Poland\u2019s beer drinkers would be hardest hit in the worst-case scenario, with the cost rising almost fivefold. In Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic, prices would double. These nations would be most affected because they brew and drink a lot of beer and import most of their brewing barley.\nOnly about a sixth of the world barley harvest is used for beer \u2013 most is fed to livestock. But the researchers found that the economics of the market mean hungry animals are prioritised when the grain is in short supply. This means disproportionately large decreases in barley for brewing, \u201cultimately resulting in dramatic regional decreases in beer consumption and increases in beer prices\u201d.\n\u201cFuture climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world,\u201d said Prof Steven Davis, at the University of California, Irvine, and one of the research team.\nGuan said uncertainties and assumptions made in the study mean the price rises and supply shortages calculated are not intended to be precise predictions but to illustrate the impact of climate change. He said it is clear from the research that global warming will make beer more expensive and less available.\nGuan suggested beer price spikes and shortages might even affect social stability, noting that the prohibition era in the US saw organised crime supplying illicit liquor.\nUsing other grains such as wheat to brew is unlikely to be an option, as all crops will suffer from extreme weather, said Guan. Nor will what he calls other \u201cluxury essentials\u201d be an alternative source of pleasure: \u201cAll these are going to be more expensive \u2013 chocolate, coffee and tea \u2013 all those crops are going to be suffering.\u201d\nProf Richard Ellis at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cFor beer drinkers, this [research] converts an abstract concept of the future efficiency of cereal production by farmers into the more real future price of beer.\u201d\nBut he said the study might underestimate the consequences of future climate change on barley yields, given significant recent drops in UK yields after only modest temperature rises. He also said the taste of beer could be affected by possible climate change impacts on hop production.\nOne scientist who reviewed the new research before publication told Guan: \u201cI hope Donald Trump loves beer. If he does he may return the US to the Paris agreement.\u201d This, however, may be a forlorn hope: Trump claims to be teetotal.", "label": 0}, "text-609": {"text": "UK Covid-19 antibody tests not ready until May at earliest\nAntibody tests to identify those who have had Covid-19 will not be available until May at the earliest, raising further questions about how the government will reach its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.\nOn Wednesday Prof John Newton, of Public Health England, conceded none of the tests trialled so far were accurate enough.\n\u201cWe do not expect to be doing antibody tests by the end of April,\u201d Newton told MPs on the science and technology select committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not relying on antibody tests to make up that target.\n\u201cWe were optimistic that a number of companies have been offering us these quick antibody tests and we were hoping they would be fit for purpose.

To that end, Harris encouraged climate realists pitching op-eds to highlight how various progressive values are threatened by climate change policies.\n\u201cIf we can show them one of the causes they hold more dear than the climate scare, then we get their attention,\u201d said Harris.\nHarris listed a number of progressive causes, from social justice to wildlife protection. Harris says climate realists should explain how these other values are threatened by climate change legislation, citing biofuels\u2019 impact on the poor, the effect of Western anti-coal efforts on electricity access in Africa, and how industrial wind turbines have killed birds and bats.\n\u201cWhat we want to do is \u2026 reference, near the beginning of our articles and our letters-to-the-editor, some cause, some issue that is really damaged as a result of the focus on climate mitigation,\u201d Harris said.\nModern Communications\nColeman followed Harris, asking, \u201cHow did this bad science sweep around the world and take control?\n\u201cMy science, my lifetime ... it has been taken over by this bad notion about carbon dioxide being this super, incredible, positive forcing element and creating this great crisis of global warming climate change,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cWell, what can we do to correct that situation?\u201d\nAnswering his own question, Coleman pulled out a smart phone, telling the audience people today watch less television and read fewer papers than those in the past. Young Americans get most of their news and information through their phones and outlets like YouTube and Facebook.\n\u201cThe climate change debate roars on Facebook,\u201d Coleman said.\nColeman says climate realists would have to combat the standard narrative through these platforms to reach young people.\n\u201cWe need a big, new team of Millennials,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAre there any Millennials attending this conference? Darn, darn few. And that\u2019s our problem. It\u2019s their world, not ours. We need not a team, we need a multitude of teams, and each of those teams needs to take on a particular source\u2014a team for Facebook, a team for Twitter, a team for Wikipedia.\u201d\nBastasch recounted how he was thrown into energy reporting without any background on the subject. After hearing constantly about how many lives EPA regulations would save or \u201chow many asthma attacks this would prevent,\u201d he began to ask about the other side of the equation.\n\u201cI started looking into, what about the coal miners, what about the people who work at the power plants ... won\u2019t this impact electricity prices?\u201d Bastasch\u00a0 asked.\nHe encouraged the audience to look out for the media\u2019s use of environmental group talking points, from \u201cclimate denier\u201d to \u201cclimate-induced extreme weather.\u201d\nDuring the question and answer period, one person asked the panel to cite two or three global warming facts to use in debating climate science.\nFocus on Moral Turpitude\nColeman, however, had a different take on the issue, responding, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to talk science. We need to talk money. The average American family of four is experiencing an increased cost of living of $1,200 a year because of global warming [regulations] at this point.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no attack we could make that would reach more people in a more positive way than talking about the moral turpitude of taking that money through increased costs for energy and food, particularly, and for travel\u2014the increased costs that families are paying and the damage it\u2019s doing to the quality of life of those young people,\u201d said Coleman.\nAnn N.

In March last year, Nancy Pelosi, the veteran Democratic leader of the House, advised her fellow Democrats against impeachment: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should go down that path.\u201d After three years of declaring Trump an existential threat to the nation, Pelosi knew that the Democrats would only help the president if they took action that was not only guaranteed to fail to remove him, but which would allow Trump to reprise his favourite role: Phoenix Rising from the Headlines.\nBut Pelosi was in a bind. Like Theresa May, she has become the manager of a process she never wanted to happen. Faced with a revolt among Democratic lawmakers who need strong anti-Trump credentials to win their congressional primaries, she eventually yielded to their determination to remove Trump via legal means. Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, seemed to provide all the ingredients that the soup of the Mueller report lacked: a Mafioso-style quid-pro-quo; a tampering with the US electoral process during, as opposed to before, Trump\u2019s presidency; and, on top of it all, the irresistible charge of cold war vintage that Trump \u2013 with his consideration of delaying the delivery of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kiev \u2013 was endangering national security by not sufficiently escalating tensions with Russia.\nThere is little question that Trump committed an impeachable offence by encouraging the Ukrainians to publicise an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine. But impeachable relative to what? Many presidents have committed impeachable offences in office \u2013 whether Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s IRS auditing of political opponents, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush\u2019s Iran-Contra scandal, or George W Bush\u2019s lying to ignite the Iraq war (a 2008 CNN interview has been making the rounds, in which the civilian Trump expresses disappointment that Pelosi did not try harder to impeach Bush for the Iraq war).\nThese comparisons make Democratic claims that to not impeach Trump would effectively mean shredding the constitution seem more than a little over-heated. However much constitutional obligation may appear to necessitate impeachment, in the end it is always a political choice.\nThe irony is that Trump is now impatient for his own Senate trial to start, which he reasonably expects will bring the public more to his side. During the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings, Trump\u2019s approval ratings rose six points. McConnell has not so much as bothered with the usual lip service about conducting an impartial trial. On 12 December, he told Fox News, \u201cWe\u2019ll be working through this process, hopefully in a fairly short period of time, in total coordination with the White House counsel\u2019s office.\u201d On 3 January, he made the case on the Senate floor that the authors of the US constitution had always intended impeachment to be a deeply political affair, which is why they designated the Senate to try presidents instead of the judiciary. Pelosi, sensing the depth of the opposition, has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which has raised the legal question of whether Trump has in fact been impeached at all.\nEither way, the circling tactic appears doomed to fail. Even if they are armed with court orders to make crucial witnesses appear, the Democrats cannot deny Trump his favourite resource \u2013 sensational television \u2013 for much longer without wearying the public\u2019s patience and taking the sting out of their original intent to remove him.\nIn 2001, the historian Perry Anderson argued that critics of US empire should have embraced the impeachment of Bill Clinton: any body blow against the imperial presidency was surely something good for the rest of the world. Today, liberals and legal scholars argue that impeachment will at least weaken the forward march of Trumpism, much as Clinton\u2019s impeachment supposedly hobbled his chosen successor, Al Gore. The trouble is that the impeachment of Clinton resulted in the opposite of presidential impairment: his approval reached an all-time postwar high of 73% during his Senate trial.\nLike Clinton\u2019s bombing of a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Trump may have diverted some attention away from his impeachment with the assassination of Qassem Suleimani. Yet this impeachable offence \u2013 engaging in an act of war without Congress\u2019s approval \u2013 is unlikely to be added to Trump\u2019s bill of offences. The presidency has accrued war powers at a rate since 9/11 that only accelerated under Obama. It would now take sweeping congressional legislation to reverse the tide. In the absence of this political will, Pelosi and the Democrats have proposed an emergency bill to make any Trump-led war on Iran only slightly more difficult.\nTrump may not enjoy a popularity bump like Clinton\u2019s during his own Senate carnival, even with McConnell as ringmaster. But however much less mystique Americans attach to their presidents since Nixon and Clinton, the office still retains an aura. For the Democrats to set themselves against it, instead of concentrating their fire on an electoral victory in November, could further inflate the executive. Their best chance for cutting the imperial presidency down to size is for them to back a presidential challenger who is dedicated to the cause of restoring Congress\u2019s war powers.\n\u2022 Thomas Meaney is a fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, Washington DC", "label": 0}, "text-614": {"text": "Growth of far right networks 'fuelled by toxic political rhetoric'\nAn expanding far right has transformed itself into loose networks of online sympathisers who share and produce extremist material fuelled by toxic mainstream political rhetoric, experts have warned.\nThese networks attempt to generate interest using messaging apps, social media and platforms such as Telegram, 8chan and Gab, with some openly supportive of Boris Johnson and his stated aim of taking the UK out of the European Union by the end of October.\nJames Goddard, a self-styled yellow vest protester, encouraged people to join him outside the Conservative party conference in Manchester this week, in opposition to what he called the \u201cunwashed, anti-democratic fanatical remainers\u201d before signing off with the hashtag #BackBoris.\nA rambling video on his Telegram and YouTube channels, which have a combined total of 17,000 subscribed accounts, shows him repeatedly harangue pro-EU protesters, calling them \u201ctraitors\u201d and accusing them of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d \u2013 a language reflecting recent debates in the Commons.\nThe so-called Tommy Robinson News channel on Telegram endorsed Johnson in early September, praising him for stripping the Conservative whip from 21 MPs for refusing to back no deal.\n\u201cIt is refreshing to see someone have a pair and stand up for British democracy,\u201d the posting begins, referring to the \u201c21 Tory traitors\u201d who voted with Labour. \u201cWe back Boris, now get us out of the EU\u201d.\nResearcher Jacob Davey, at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, said: \u201cThere\u2019s clearly been a response to Boris Johnson and some of the rhetoric from his government in far right circles.

Here is what to expect in what is being billed as one of the most hurriedly rewritten budgets of recent times.\nThere will be extra cash for the health service to fund test centres at hospitals and to purchase testing kits.\nCash for GP surgeries, which are expected to come under intense pressure as the virus spreads, will also be set aside. Attempts to attract back retired and semi-retired doctors and nurses to help cope with the anticipated epidemic have so far failed, according to some reports from health trusts.\nSunak is expected to help stem the tide by easing the restrictions on pension tax relief. It is hoped this will reverse the exodus of doctors in recent years as they hit their tax-free limits. Many have quit after exceeding their limit and being asked to make large repayments.\nConcerns that small businesses will be badly hit by a spike in sickness rates and the need for many staff to self-isolate has spurred the Treasury to bolt together a multimillion-pound protection fund. Employers with up to 100 employees will be able to make claims on the fund to recover some of the costs to their businesses from the virus outbreak, Sunak will say. The chancellor is concerned that smaller firms will find it more difficult coping with staff absences than large companies.\nWithin his fiscal rules, the chancellor has some headroom for increasing capital spending as part of national infrastructure strategy; the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates about \u00a310bn per annum. He could also announce a temporary increase in the cap on net public investment to cover the impact on major projects such as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail. An increase in the cap from 3% to 3.5% of GDP would give him a further \u00a310bn to \u00a312bn headroom in the years ahead.\nSunak, though, is expected to say that more than \u00a3100bn in extra spending to boost the economy and tackle the climate emergency will be delayed until after the budget.\nThe Treasury may have hundreds more staff than it did just two years ago to put in place new policies. However, most of them have found themselves up to their eyes in Brexit planning and, in more recent weeks, deciding how to cope with the coronavirus.\nA plan to improve transport connectivity and work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, due to be published alongside the budget, will now be delayed for several weeks.\nPlans to kickstart the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda look like being delayed even further, most likely to the autumn budget.\nThe chancellor will be keen to say he is improving the incomes of low-paid workers. A rise in the national insurance threshold and a faster increase in minimum wage will be billed as offering support.\nIt is understood that planning for a rise in the national insurance threshold from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 from the start of the 2020-21 tax year was well advanced when Sunak took over at the Treasury following Sajid Javid\u2019s shock resignation in the second week of February. This change will give an average family with two earners a tax cut of about \u00a3192 a year.\nLast September, Javid declared the Conservatives were now the \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d of Britain, as he announced plans to extend the main minimum wage rate to all workers aged 21 and over and raise it to two-thirds of median earnings by April 2024.\nSunak is expected to make a similar pledge, though maybe to push back the target date from 2024.\nThere is a head of steam behind demands to abolish entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, saving an estimated \u00a32.6bn, or at least reform it. With only an estimated 5,200 people benefiting last year and speculation that they all number among the super-rich, the tax break could be chopped or limited to smaller businesses.\nPlans to reform pension tax relief are expected to be considered by a wide-ranging review of the government\u2019s support for retirement saving. More than \u00a340bn is lost to the exchequer from subsidising pension savings, with the bulk going to higher-rate taxpayers.

Let's get back to the facts\nOver the past 30 years I have reported so many broken climate policy promises and quoted so much rhetoric that proved to be hollow, it is difficult to trace it back to the start. I think it\u2019s a faded press release from 11 October, 1990 headed \u201cgovernment sets targets for reductions in greenhouse gases\u201d.\n\u201cThe government recognises the greenhouse effect as one of the major environmental concerns facing the world,\u201d said Ros Kelly, Bob Hawke\u2019s environment minister. \u201cThis decision puts Australia at the forefront of international action to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases.\u201d\nWe knew we had to do something almost three decades ago. Children have grown to adulthood and had their own children during the time we have known, and done not very much.\nWe were then, apparently, going to meet our target through \u201cno regrets\u201d actions \u2013 things that made sense for other environmental reasons as well as climate concerns. We didn\u2019t meet it. We haven\u2019t ever met any of a succession of greenhouse gas reduction targets by actually reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to rise, still. No regrets? At the forefront? If only.\n1990 was the year the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report made clear predictions \u2013 of higher temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and impacts on agriculture.\nThey are no longer predictions. They are our reality now. We just endured the hottest summer on record. In Port Augusta the thermometer hit 49.5 degrees. Across the country more than 200 temperature records were broken. Nine of the 10 warmest years in Australia\u2019s records have occurred since 2005. Communities have no water. Flying foxes are dropping dead from the trees. Up to a million fish have died in the parched Murray-Darling \u2013 an ongoing environmental, social and economic catastrophe. We have been warned that without urgent action, the Darling will die. The bushfire season is starting earlier and different kinds of forests are burning, one in Tasmania stands over 1,000 years old. Flooding is more frequent and rainfall patterns are changing. Our ecosystems are being driven to collapse.\nFor all those decades some politicians tried and failed to act, because others tried harder and succeeded in preventing it. For a brief moment we had a carbon price, and greenhouse emissions did fall, but then it was abolished, ostensibly in the name of reducing the price of groceries and services, which had never risen much in the first place, but mostly in the cynical interests of trying to win an election.\nThere were various other attempts at credible policy over the years, from across the political spectrum, as well as some spectacularly bad ones, but in the end effective policy was mostly washed away by political timidity, outright ignorance and the well-financed lobbying efforts of mining companies determined to delay the eventual phasing-out of coal.\nBut as the evidence of a changing climate defies denial, those who have spent careers delaying or refuting the need for action have untethered their arguments from fact. Climate policy is no longer a real \u201cdebate\u201d about the existential threat at the heart of the issue, and competing ideas about how to address it, but rather it has become a proxy for an ongoing war of attrition, in particular between the Coalition\u2019s moderates and conservatives, stripped of policy meaning to become a vacuous argument about being \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d fossil fuels.\nThose who would thwart action are also again resorting to that tired contention that would undermine any action by any nation on any global issue \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t have to do anything because we are responsible for just a proportion of the problem, or put another way, we shouldn\u2019t do anything because we can\u2019t solve the problem on our own.\nThey sow uncertainty and sometimes they descend to farce, such as citing Dorothea MacKellar\u2019s poetic reference to \u201cdroughts and flooding rains\u201d in refutation of scientific fact or claiming that renewable energy will \u201ckill\u201d night sporting fixtures.\nThey ignore or misquote their own advice to persist with the blind belief that building new coal-fired power stations is the only way the nation can secure affordable, reliable power. They claim, for example, that the energy market operator backs investment in coal-fired power, when in fact its modelling says the opposite. And, just for the record, as Guardian Australia\u2019s Katharine Murphy has pointed out, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission didn\u2019t recommend it either. No one has, because underwriting a coal-fired power station and indemnifying it against any future climate measures makes no economic sense.\nBut the government \u2013 including its resources minister \u2013 is persisting with its faith in new plants, even as the mining and power companies that have profited richly from coal fired power for years, and spent millions on secret public relations campaigns trying to prolong its use, are conceding the gig is up.\nEven more bewilderingly, it is persisting with the idea even as it seeks to build credentials with an electorate increasingly concerned about global warming, informed by what they are seeing and reading about current events, and what they are experiencing in their lives.\nThe prime minister who once fondled a lump of coal in the parliament, is brandishing a \u201cclimate solutions package\u201d, the contradiction most baldly evident in the fact that he is now simultaneously advocating taxpayer support for renewable projects that rely on coal-fired power stations closing, and also taxpayer support for opening new ones.\nWe\u2019ve seen this eleventh hour conversion before \u2013 when John Howard reluctantly said he would introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2007, faced with rising voter concern after the millennial drought. (He later admitted he did it only because of the political pressure, and never really believed in the idea.)\nAt Guardian Australia, we think it is time, a long way past time, to take a breath and go back to the facts. We\u2019ve tried to do this all along, of course, but at this crisis point we want to take stock of what is already happening \u2013 things we know about but need to understand better, such as the crisis in the Murray-Darling \u2013 and also consequences of climate change that are less well known or just emerging. We want to look at the latest forecasts and what they mean for our lives, our communities and our environment, and \u2013 putting the political rhetoric and posturing aside \u2013 assess the policies for emission reduction and adaptation and the broader impacts and consequences.\nRegret, at this point, is unavoidable: regret that Australia has been a drag on global efforts to address climate change, regret for having scrapped so long that the cost and disruption of doing what we must has risen and will be borne largely by our kids, regret for the billions of dollars wasted on half-baked policies, regret for the scandalous waste of time and effort and opportunity.\nBut given what\u2019s at stake, it can\u2019t be too late to regroup, and assess the facts, to inform the most sensible path from here.", "label": 0}, "text-618": {"text": "Carbon tax another major blow to Alberta\u2019s investment climate\nFor many years, Alberta has maintained a strong investment climate vis-\u00e0-vis other provinces and other energy-producing jurisdictions. This helped set the foundation for robust economic performance and make Wild Rose Country the envy of many economies. A competitive, well-designed tax regime anchored an assortment of pro-growth economic policies, collectively known as the Alberta Advantage.\n\nA series of policy changes over the past several months has buried that advantage with the latest nail in the coffin coming from the provincial government\u2019s new climate change strategy. Among other things, the strategy calls for a phased-in carbon tax starting January 2017 and reaching $30 per tonne in January 2018. This will impose an additional tax burden on Albertan businesses and families.\n\nThe proposed carbon tax must be placed in the context of provincial policy choices that have eroded the Alberta Advantage. More broadly, the carbon tax is yet another blow to Alberta\u2019s investment climate, making the province a less desirable place to work and invest. And this comes at the most inopportune time as the province struggles in the face of depressed commodity prices and weak economic performance.\n\nLet\u2019s recap some of the government\u2019s recent economically damaging policies to demonstrate the extent to which Alberta\u2019s once exemplary investment climate has been tarnished.\n\nIn the fall, the government increased the general corporate tax rate from 10 to 12 per cent, a 20 per cent jump. This tax hike sent a powerful, negative signal to both domestic and international investors about the direction of economic policy and weakened the incentives for firms to invest and create jobs. The economics literature is clear that higher corporate taxes are among the most damaging forms of taxation as they deter investment and dull growth.\n\nThe government also eliminated the province\u2019s single personal income tax rate of 10 per cent, replacing it with five distinct tax brackets and increasing the top marginal rate by 50 per cent. The old single rate gave Alberta a unique advantage, helping the province attract and retain skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and investment. Alberta now no longer has the lowest top combined federal and provincial (or state) income tax rate among Canadian provinces and U.S. states. In fact, its top marginal rate is higher than competing energy-producing jurisdictions in the U.S. including Texas, Alaska, and Wyoming\u2014all of which have no state income tax.\n\nIn addition to these tax increases, the government has introduced economically damaging regulations. For example, it set in motion a plan to significantly increase the minimum wage over the next several years, despite the overwhelming evidence that higher minimum wages increase unemployment, especially among young and low-skilled workers. Prior to October 1, the minimum wage in Alberta was $10.20 but it is scheduled to rise steadily before reaching $15/hour in 2018. This represents a 47 per cent increase.\n\nIn the energy sector, the government created further uncertainty this spring by announcing plans for a royalty review. It has since said there would be no rate increases until 2017, quelling concerns about immediate royalty hikes, but the prospect of an increase in the future remains a concern.\n\nThe newly announced carbon tax and accompanying environmental regulations will be layered on top of these policy changes. The combination of higher personal and corporate taxes with a new carbon tax is particularly troubling given that Alberta\u2019s energy sector will be at a marked disadvantage relative to competing energy-producing jurisdictions such as Texas, North Dakota, and Wyoming\u2014none of which have or are actively considering a carbon tax. Taken together, the policy changes will undermine the province\u2019s ability to compete effectively with these and other jurisdictions.\n\nIn the context of already implemented anti-growth policies, this week\u2019s carbon tax announcement is yet another major blow to Alberta\u2019s investment climate. The \u201cAlberta Advantage\u201d served the province well for many years.

Hollingsworth said such criticism was \u201cnot wholly right, but it is not unfair\u201d. He pointed to the hugely successful This Girl Can campaign, which has helped hundreds of thousands of women get more active, as showing how the organisation could make a difference.\nHe said he had high hopes for a \u00a3100m investment from the exchequer and lottery in 12 pilot schemes designed to help communities in poorer areas develop and test their own plans to get people active. \u201cSome of those solutions might not work and that\u2019s fine as long as we learn from that,\u201d he said.\nHollingsworth insisted he was confident of hitting a government target of getting 500,000 more people exercising regularly by 2020, including 250,000 women and 100,000 from deprived areas, but he accepted more needed to be done.\nHe pointed out that \u00a33m had been recently given to the parkrun movement to enable it to set up new runs in harder-to-reach communities and \u00a31.5m had been provided for the Daily Mile, the back-to-basics fitness initiative for schoolchildren.\nHollingsworth said Sport England was starting to make some headway with the idea of involving sport and physical activity in the doctor\u2019s surgery and said it had helped to train 12,000 healthcare professionals to provide better information about exercise to patients.\n\u201cAcross the board, we are focused on demonstrating the transformational impact that sport and activity can have across society, not only on people\u2019s physical wellbeing and mental health, but on societal cohesion,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "text-621": {"text": "Hazard reduction burning had little to no effect in slowing extreme bushfires\nHazard reduction burning had little to no effect in slowing the most severe fires that devastated more than 5m hectares across New South Wales this summer, an analysis has found.\nForest scientists from the University of Melbourne said initial results suggested hazard reduction was best used in a targeted way around assets to help protect them from less intense fires.\nIt challenges claims by some politicians that state governments should substantially increase hazard reduction, possibly to meet a target of 5% of land each year. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested he may introduce national standards that would report on how much hazard reduction the states carried out each year.\nSpeaking in parliament on Wednesday, Morrison said hazard reduction was at least as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to protect people as fire seasons worsened.\nThe University of Melbourne desktop analysis used Rural Fire Service data to compare the size and severity of this season\u2019s bushfires area with hazard reduction burns over the past five years. The majority of the area in which there had been prescribed burning had been razed again by bushfire in the past three months.\nPatrick Baker, a professor of silviculture and forest ecology, said the prescribed burning did not \u201cseem to have done much at all\u201d in areas that faced a crowning bushfire that burned the canopy.\nHe said the fire that devastated the NSW south coast between Batemans Bay and Jervis Bay over the new year scored 3.95 out of 4 on a severity scale despite recent hazard reduction burns in the area, some of which scored up to 3.8. \u201cPretty much the whole area was torched,\u201d Baker said.\nThe analysis found prescribed burning was likely to have helped save property in areas on the fringe of major fire complexes where the flames were less severe, such as Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.\nBaker said it suggested prescribed burning was most effective when used as part of a risk-based system designed to help protect chosen assets \u2013 human life, biodiversity, property and water catchments \u2013 rather than based on an arbitrary numeric target. He said a 5% annual target risked leading to swathes of remote landscape being burned without significantly reducing the risk to assets.\nIn Victoria, for example, burning the sandy soiled landscape in the Mallee, which makes up nearly a fifth of the state, would do little to protect assets but could have a catastrophic impact on native animals and plants, he said.\n\u201cWe need to be smart about where we burn,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe other issue is we don\u2019t have endless resources to do this. It\u2019s extraordinarily expensive, so if people want to double or triple or quadruple prescribed burning, the question is what else are we not going to get done?\u201d\nMorrison announced on Tuesday that former a defence chief, Mark Binskin, would lead a royal commission into the bushfire crisis, which has claimed 33 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and is estimated to have killed more than 1bn animals.\nScientists and former emergency service chiefs say the climate crisis has exacerbated fire risk and reduced the window each year in which hazard reduction burning can be safely carried out. They say the increased threat demands both greater resources to fight fires and urgent action to cut emissions.\nA group of 31 ex-fire and emergency bosses will write to Morrison on Thursday saying the royal commission will be a waste of time and money if it does not examine the role of climate change.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday night, Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, said: \u201cClimate change has increased fire danger so much that fires now burn freely through areas that have undergone hazard reduction burning recently. I saw fires a metre high burning across mown lawns while fighting fires at Batemans Bay on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d\nThe current Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told the ABC on Wednesday that, while some objected to the description, the ongoing fire crisis was clearly unprecedented. He said no fire season had taken as many lives, destroyed as many homes and burned through a quarter of the state\u2019s forested country across the Great Dividing Range. \u201cThe reality is it has been an extraordinary, difficult, damaging, destructive, fatal and tragic fire season, and it is without precedent,\u201d he said.\nThe 5% annual hazard reduction target was recommended by the royal commission into the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, which killed 173 people. Neil Comrie, a former Victoria police chief commissioner who was appointed to oversee implementation of the royal commission\u2019s recommendations, later found the target was likely to not be achievable, affordable or sustainable, and the primary focus should be protection of lives and communities.\nThe Victorian Andrews government dropped the 5% goal and adopted a risk-based approach in 2016, pledging to focus on reducing fuel loads close to communities and in remote back-country areas where fires can start, grow and build in intensity.\nJohn Thwaites, a former Victorian deputy premier and environment minister and now the chairman of Monash Sustainable Development Institute, said despite claims the states were not doing enough, fuel reduction had risen 61% in Victoria in the decade following the Black Saturday fires compared with the previous 10 years.\nEven with that increase, the state met its increased hazard reduction targets only twice before moving to the risk-based system three years ago. It planned to burn 246,000 hectares in 2019, but managed little more than half that because it was not safe to burn, officials said.\nIn NSW, both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Rural Fire Service met hectare-based targets for fuel reduction last year, but the rural service fell short of a goal of limiting fire hazards around 113,130 properties.\nThwaites said higher temperatures, drier fuel and stronger winds were increasingly making it unsafe to burn in autumn and spring, but a risk-based approach using sophisticated modelling such as that being adopted in Victoria would reduce the likelihood that homes were lost.", "label": 0}, "text-622": {"text": "NFL teams up with north London college to spot British talent\nLucrative sports scholarships to US universities are among the potential prizes on offer from a new partnership between the US\u2019s National Football League (NFL) and a further education college in north London.\nAfter decades of mixed success in building a British fanbase for American football \u2013 including regular NFL games at Wembley stadium and a short-lived European league \u2013 the NFL\u2019s latest move is to use London as a recruiting pool for talent.\nFrom September, Barnet and Southgate college is partnering with the NFL to launch a programme for 16- to 18-year-olds combining full-time education with professional instruction by experienced American football coaches.\n\u201cWe are proud and excited to be the first UK college to offer this unique programme in partnership with the NFL,\u201d said Darren Mepham, the chief executive of the college, which already hosts similar programmes including athletics, boxing and a football partnership with Tottenham Hotspur.\nUp to 80 students are expected to participate, after applying to take part in trials via the academy\u2019s website.

A detailed breakdown of the methodology can be found here. \nThe Guardian also compiled publicly available information about donations, salaries, gifts and other interests registered by MPs that are linked to the fossil fuel industries.\nThe analysis has already provoked strong reactions from some MPs, while others \u2013 even those with modest scores \u2013 recognised it was an important exercise that would stimulate debate between voters and the people who represent them.\nThe sole criteria in assessing MPs\u2019 scores was whether their votes were likely to increase or reduce emissions.\nSo, votes for fracking and Heathrow expansion were considered negative because those bills encouraged more carbon-intensive gas production and airline travel.\nBut votes for onshore wind and subsidies for renewable energy were deemed positive because those bills would have accelerated the shift to a low-carbon economy. \nFor this analysis, a vote for nuclear power was judged positive in purely climate terms, even though there are many other serious environmental and economic concerns about this form of energy. Motions passed without a recorded vote could not be included in the scores.\nIn addition, the Guardian looked at information taken from the parliamentary register of MPs\u2019 interests that showed donations, salaries or benefits from fossil fuel companies, aviation firms or individuals and organisations that deny the need for urgent climate action.\nThe results are not intended as the final word on whether an MP is for or against climate action, and there are limitations to the methodology used.\nThe Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months.\nThe project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute,\u00a0calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"\nOne aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.\u00a0\nAnother aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\nFor example, it is difficult to quantify the work politicians do in committees, mobilising colleagues, spending time on climate issues or speaking out in the House of Commons. Individual MPs\u2019 votes are also heavily influenced by the party whip.\nYet academics and campaigners said they hoped the analysis would spur a debate about why parliament is not doing more to cut the UK\u2019s emissions.\n\u201cEvery MP will look at this list and say: \u2018Why am I there?\u2019 They will have to justify their position,\u201d said Rebecca Willis, a research associate at Lancaster University who has studied parliamentary attitudes on global warming.\nThe analysis also comes at a critical moment, before a likely general election that could leave the winning party in power until 2025 \u2013 halfway through the decade in which scientists warn that humankind must make a decisive shift away from fossil fuels and other sources of carbon emissions.\nThe current government already claims to be on the right path and political parties across the spectrum express support for radical action. \nYet the the Guardian\u2019s analysis shows Tory MPs have frequently voted down short-term practical measures to reduce emissions, for example through home heating efficiency or renewable energy subsidies, while lending their support to fracking and airport expansion.\nThe Conservatives have the worst record of any party, with an average score of 17%.\nDespite Labour\u2019s relatively high score of 86%, the party\u2019s record was more mixed when it was in power in 2008-10. A year after pushing through the landmark Climate Change Act, Gordon Brown\u2019s government voted against the 10:10 climate campaign and blocked a bill that would have made airport expansion more difficult.\nThe Conservatives, who were then in opposition, supported both measures because their leader David Cameron wanted to create an image of a greener party. Yet after winning in 2010, his party \u2013 then in coalition with the Liberal Democrats \u2013 rolled back ambitious climate policies.\nThe Lib Dems had an average score of 59% \u2013 until they accepted a number of ex-Tory MPs. Their inclusion brought the party down to 51%.\nThe research has thrown up anomalies.\nSome relatively green Conservative MPs, such as Peter Bottomley (23%), Sarah Newton (15%), Peter Aldous (23%) and James Heappey (0%), have low scores because they were only eligible for a handful of votes, and in those they stuck to the party line.\nOther more climate sceptical MPs \u2013 most notably Owen Paterson (42%) \u2013 scored relatively highly because he has been in the house long enough to have been part of Cameron\u2019s green Tory rebranding.\nSimilarly, some Labour MPs have higher scores because they have only voted in opposition, while the stalwart environmental campaigners Kerry McCarthy (86%) and Mary Creagh (78%) fell short of a perfect mark because they stuck to the party line over the 10:10 campaign and airport expansion.\nEd Milliband scored 78% although, as author of the 2008 Climate Change Act, he has arguably achieved as much as any MP in promoting emissions cuts.\n MPs who have a strong record on the environment said privately they were glad parliamentarians were being held to account on their climate voting records, though this could never be a perfect measure.", "label": 0}, "text-624": {"text": "new report reveals huge cost of climate change act to british households\nA new report published in London by the Global Warming Policy Foundation reveals the extraordinary \u00a3319 billion cost of Britain's Climate Change Act.

Emblem of a scamper into Tigger mode\nCometh the hour, cometh the man. Or perhaps not. Matt Hancock had been expected to give the previous day\u2019s Downing Street press briefing but got pulled in favour of Rishi Sunak, following the publication of Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s report suggesting GDP was set to tank by 35% over the next three months.\nSo you might have thought the health secretary would have used the extra 24 hours to fine-tune his announcements on social care.\nNot so much. Over the past few weeks Hancock has been one of the few cabinet ministers to look even vaguely competent, but today he let his department down, he let his country down, but worst of all he let himself down. And there\u2019s nothing worse than a Tigger who lets a Tigger down. The best he can do now is go home to watch a replay of his press conference and cry himself to sleep.\nHancock began by praising 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore for raising \u00a37m for the NHS by walking round his garden. As well he might. For that \u00a37m probably represents roughly the sum of what the Conservative government has taken out of the NHS each day over the past 10 years or so. Certainly, the legendary Chris Grayling has managed to waste twice that in a single visit to the despatch box in the Commons.\nThereafter it was all downhill. I am here to tell you the next steps in our social care package, Tigger bounced. Which was news to everyone as up till now even the first baby steps had been kept a closely guarded secret.\nWhen Boris Johnson became prime minister he assured the country he had a social care package ready and waiting to go. To go precisely nowhere, as ever since we\u2019ve heard precisely zilch. Nada. Social care for the elderly still appeared to be the government\u2019s lowest priority even during a coronavirus pandemic that disproportionately affected old people.\nSo here was the deal. More workers and care home residents would be getting tested and there would definitely be more personal protection equipment available. Though starting from a baseline of near zero this wasn\u2019t quite the earth-shattering announcement that Hancock had led everyone to expect.\nBut luckily, Tigger was planning on saving the best till last. Because he knew that what social care workers really wanted wasn\u2019t testing, PPE, more money or a home secretary who dismissed them all as low-skilled. It was a shiny new green badge, saying CARE, that he was proud to model.\nA badge. A sodding badge. Even the writers of the TV series The Thick of It wouldn\u2019t have dared come up with something as crass as this. Especially as it was a badge that had already been launched a year previously to the general indifference of everyone in the care home sector.\nThis was Tigger\u2019s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire moment. He was sorry that no social care workers had won the jackpot this week; the producers were withholding the \u00a31m top prize because they suspected cheating had taken place as there had been a lot of background coughing during the recording of the show \u2013 but as a gesture of goodwill, and to make sure no one went home empty-handed, he would be giving every contestant a badge. And a Tigger cuddly toy.\nHard to believe, but the badges really were the high point of the entire 45-minute briefing. Hancock looked genuinely dismayed that the media weren\u2019t quite as wowed by them as he was \u2013 Fighting Corona, a Badge at a Time \u2013 and he rather went into meltdown during the question and answer session.\nFirst he made out that the reason testing levels had actually fallen in recent days was because NHS workers were far too busy sunning themselves in the park during the Easter Bank holiday weekend and they couldn\u2019t be arsed to come in for a test. You can only imagine the conversations that must have been taking place all over the UK. \u201cShall I go and get the test for which I\u2019ve been begging for for weeks? Or shall I just not bother and top up the tan?\u201d\nHancock also appeared to be clueless as to why the government was seemingly unable to give even a hint of what criteria it would be using when considering a possible relaxation of the lockdown rules. There was no strategy to have a strategy. The best he could come up with was that different governments were at different stages of preparation so it would be wrong to make any comparisons.\nThe strong implication was that our government was still at the \u201ccompletely hopeless\u201d stage of preparation so we shouldn\u2019t be holding our breath for any news any time soon. This is a decision that appears to be well above everyone\u2019s pay grade, including the prime minister\u2019s.\nEven that wasn\u2019t the nadir. Matt can\u2019t go out to meet the press without having a plan of action involving numbers. Last time out he had a five-pillar plan, almost none of which had yet to happen. So why should anyone believe a word he said now?\nLaura Hughes, of the Financial Times, gently pointed out that he had promised 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April and we were still down in the 16,000s. Which made the 100,000 promise in two weeks\u2019 time look totally unrealistic.\nHere Tigger lost the plot. It was all a big lie. A conspiracy. He had never said 25,000 tests by the middle of April. FAKE NEWS. He had said 25,000 by the end of April which he had then increased to 100K. So just wait and see. He believed he could fly. He believed he could touch the sky. Mystic Tigger. Unaccountably, Hughes was the only journalist not granted a supplementary question in which she could nail the inconsistencies in his memory. Instead, he bounced out the room, kissing the badge in triumph.

The vote came as Sports Direct admitted it no longer has an auditor after the incumbent, Grant Thornton, resigned at the retailer\u2019s sparsely attended shareholder meeting in London. The retailer has so far been unable to persuade any other auditing firm to take on the job.\nGrant Thornton stepped down after the retailer\u2019s chaotic annual results announcement in July. After more than 10 hours of delays, the company said it could not issue profit guidance for the year ahead as it had received an unexpected \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) tax bill from Belgium. The company\u2019s finance director also quit.\nThe retailer\u2019s new finance director, Chris Wootton, said on Wednesday that Sports Direct was \u201cgoing through a process\u201dto appoint a new auditor but did not indicate how long it would take.\nUnder the Companies Act, Sports Direct must now formally notify the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, within a week, that it has failed to appoint an auditor. If it does not do so it will face a fine.\nLeadsom has the power to appoint an auditor if and when all other efforts to do so have been exhausted. It is not clear whether she will step in but as a listed company Sports Direct must have an auditor in place by the time of its full-year results, which are usually announced in July. \nAudit experts said Sports Direct would normally have had a new auditor lined up months ago. They said a firm would normally have to start work on the interim figures just before Sports Direct\u2019s half year finishes at the end of October. Although unusual, unaudited interim results can be published, so long as the company announces to the stock market that the interim results have not been audited.\nAshley said he paid close attention to the accounts to ensure they were \u201csimple and conservative\u201d as the majority of his personal wealth was tied up in the company.\n\u201cIf [the shares] don\u2019t perform I\u2019m in trouble. I just have a different perspective. It will be a bumpy ride but we will get there,\u201d he said.\nAshley said the company was unlikely to pay a dividend for years to come while it invested in improving House of Fraser and Sports Direct stores. It paid \u00a390m to buy House of Fraser out of administration in August 2018 and in its end year results described the business as \u201cterminal\u201d, adding that with the benefit of hindsight it should probably not have bought the department store chain.\nThe retailer\u2019s shares were largely flat at 264p, but are down from 350p a year ago. Four years ago they were changing hands at more than 800p.\nAshley said the future of Sports Direct relied on moving away from its longstanding \u201cpile it high, sell it cheap\u201d business model, and towards more upmarket brands. He said \u201celevation is our golden ticket\u201d and that he wanted to open more outlets similar to a converted BHS in Leicester, which includes a Sports Direct alongside the group\u2019s upmarket Flannels fashion store and streetwear outlet USC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening, it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s just not as fast as I would like it,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cI would like to click my fingers and have 100 Leicesters tomorrow \u2026 God do they take some money,\u201d he said.\nHowever, in an eccentric outburst, Ashley then told shareholders not to buy anything in the Flannels store downstairs from the annual meeting on Oxford Street, central London. \u201cIt\u2019s eye-watering what some of the prices are for a pair of shoes or a cap,\u201d he said.\nRichard Bottomley, a non-executive director, said Sports Direct needed to make improvements in its corporate governance and insisted that the company was making changes. \u201cCorporate governance is important to us as an organisation and [something] we are well aware of and are discussing,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Ashley said he did not intend to carry out a review of corporate governance standards, as he had once promised. He insisted he was not a \u201cpantomime villain\u201d and that handing out bonuses of \u00a350m to full-time staff put him \u201cstreets ahead of other people\u201d.\nJohn Gray from the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, which represents about \u00a3100m of shares in Sports Direct, criticised the company for rejecting its call for an independent review of corporate governance and ignoring requests for a meeting.\nGray asked: \u201cCan you explain why you have found it difficult to get an auditor and non-executive directors with relevant experience?\u201d \nBottomley told about 15 shareholders who attended the meeting that there had been \u201cno argument\u201d with Grant Thornton but Sports Direct had been disappointed at the delay with its results. \nGrant Thornton is under close scrutiny by the accounting regulator and at the time of the Sports Direct results was under investigation over the retailer\u2019s failure to disclose a transaction with a company owned by Ashley\u2019s brother.\nWootton said Sports Direct had \u201ctotal confidence in our numbers\u201d.\n\u201cMedia likes to sensationalise this kind of thing. We are going through a process.

There is particular concern among some conservatives about a possible shift to a net zero emissions target by 2050.\nThe government has undertaken to look at shifting to a net zero by 2050 commitment through the Pacific Islands Forum, but Morrison said this week that \u201cpeople who make these commitments need to be able to tell people what it will cost them\u201d.\n\u201cWe need to understand what that means \u2013 I mean, people can say that, but what does that mean for jobs? Now I can\u2019t answer that question right now \u2026 But I\u2019m concerned it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing.\u201d\nBut in a sign of the political challenge facing Morrison, moderate MPs in inner-city seats are at the same time pushing for more ambitious action, amid concern that climate change will be a hot button issue at the next election.\nOn Tuesday, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, talked up the government\u2019s \u201coverachievement\u201d for emissions reduction, saying the government\u2019s position was clear that Australia would only use carryover credits if needed.\n\u201cThe result of Australians overachieving on our 2012 targets and on our 2020 targets \u2026 means there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of the hard work of Australian families, households and businesses, and we believe that we should be given credit for that,\u201d Taylor told Sky News.\n\u201cWe are ahead of the game and our targets are a floor, not a cap, they are not a cap on our ambition and we will continue to work hard to meet and beat those targets by 2030.\u201d\nAccording to the latest government projections of Australia\u2019s emissions, Australia will only meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by between 395m tonnes and 462m tonnes by relying on 411m tonnes of carryover credits.\nThe trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said on Monday he wanted the government\u2019s \u201cambition\u201d to be achieving the emissions reduction targets without the need for carryover credits.\n\u201cThat\u2019s got to be the ambition in terms of the way in which we seek, as a government, to be able to reduce our emissions and reduce Australia\u2019s emissions into the future and applying all of those new technologies,\u201d Birmingham said.\nMorrison this week smacked down the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, for suggesting federal Liberals were pushing the government to increase its ambition on emissions reduction and abandon the use of carryover credits.\n\u201cMatt Kean doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the federal cabinet [and] most of the federal cabinet wouldn\u2019t even know who Matt Kean was.\n\u201cWe are dealing with our climate policies in the same way as we took them to the election \u2026 we will meet and beat our emission reduction targets,\u201d Morrison said.", "label": 0}, "text-632": {"text": "climate alarmists fear debating flimsy science claims\n\"Honest, competent scientists should have no reason to close out opportunities for open discussion regarding claims that appear to be disproven by readily verifiable observations.\" Writing at Newsmax, Professor Larry Bell quotes three examples associated with climate change.", "label": 1}, "text-633": {"text": "Conservative road to climate catastrophe\nBrexit doesn\u2019t matter.

In Europe, once-thriving Alpine ski resorts are left to rot for lack of snow, and here in the UK flooding is starting to become endemic. Catastrophic feedback loops, points of no return, are inevitable unless we change our way of living quickly.\nLabour is the only major party with viable plans to tackle this.

But sport shows how united we can be\nDepressed about Brexit? There\u2019s always golf. As Brexit threatens the economic \u2013 and actual \u2013 security of Ireland, north and south, maybe what we can lean into a little more on this island is the unifying power of sport. Sport in Ireland overlaps with identities in curious ways, but there are many moments when perceived divisions can fade into the green distance, like a man from Offaly being cheered on at a course in Northern Ireland, about to win the Open. Tricolours being waved at Royal Portrush, a chorus of \u201col\u00e9s\u201d, videos of Shane Lowry grinning as the Fields of Athenry is sung.\nMeanwhile, Lowry\u2019s grandmother Emily Scanlon offered the most Irish of all anecdotes regarding sports nutrition on the Irish station RT\u00c9. \u201cI remember I minded him while the mother was working,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a turf box in the corner beside the range, and when I\u2019d go up to the clothesline I\u2019d put him into it, and he\u2019d have all the turf mould ate ... whether it worked his immune system or what, I don\u2019t know. He got there anyway. Great gossoon [young boy] he was.\u201d Turf mould may not be the next carrageen moss, but the moments sport can offer up, on their day, are some tonic.\nSporting rivalries between England and Ireland tend to be clear \u2013 Irish people want England to lose, and when that feeling dissipates on occasion, say, during the common occurrence of a football tournament that England has qualified for and Ireland has not, the rivalry can crumble in a fit of empathy, and column inches and talk radio schedules fill up with whether or not it\u2019s OK to cheer for the colonial oppressor. Irish people talk about English people as though there are none in the room, even though they are our largest non-Irish demographic. That said, the first time I found myself genuinely, authentically, briefly, cheering for an English team, was during the recent World Cup. My heart broke for Steph Houghton when she missed that penalty. It was a weird feeling.\nLess discussed are sporting rivalries north and south, and the possibilities and complexities of sporting unity across Ireland, backstop or no backstop. It is possible that Brexit will cause the breakup of the United Kingdom in the future, so what would the sporting landscape look like then? Ireland is already united across a number of sports. Symbols are amended. Flags are neutralised. Anthems are composed.\nRugby in Ireland grew initially as a game primarily played by the Protestant middle classes in Ulster and Dublin. Its scope is much broader now, but we are the team with two anthems \u2013 Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann and the newer Ireland\u2019s Call at home, with only the latter played abroad. Ireland\u2019s Call was composed by the Derryman Phil Coulter for the 1995 World Cup. It is one of the best and most successful examples of an attempt to find a neutral emotional space in Irish sport: one of those bridges built between north and south that our former president Mary McAleese used to speak about \u2013 the white between the green and orange, viewed as a little cringey at the outset, but now embraced.\nFootball has proved a bridge too far, though, after the national team was severed in the 1920s. The Football Association of Ireland was formed in 1921, when the Leinster Football Association split from the Ulster-based Irish Football Association, creating two teams. An all-Ireland soccer team still seems unlikely, despite popping up as a hypothetical every few years (George Best was a fan of the idea).\nThe former Formula One driver Eddie Irvine, from County Down, asked for a white flag with a shamrock to be used when he won a race. The motor sport governing body, the FIA, said that a union jack should have been raised upon his victory in Buenos Aires in 1997, as opposed to the tricolour that was hoisted instead. Many will remember Irvine\u2019s Ferrari helmet with its white shamrock on a green background (probably less controversial, in retrospect, than the giant Marlboro cigarette logo). He also sported a green shamrock on the waistband of his race suit.\nA cross-border flag, or four provinces flag, is used by the Irish field hockey team, also an all-Ireland team. The Irish cricket team also goes for shamrocks to join north and south. Speaking of cricket, \u201cwe clearly don\u2019t need Europe to win,\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted after England\u2019s World Cup victory, failing to realise that the captain of the English team, Eoin Morgan, is a Dubliner. When asked at a press conference after the final match whether the luck of an Irishman got England over the line, Morgan deferred to his teammate Adil Rashid\u2019s faith. \u201cWe had Allah with us as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to Adil who said we had Allah with us. We had the rub of the green. It actually epitomises our team. There\u2019s quite diverse backgrounds and cultures and guys growing up in different countries.\u201d And with that, Morgan, like Lowry, demonstrated that talented, gracious sportspeople will always find fans, no matter where they\u2019re from, or who they play for.\n\u2022 Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish Times", "label": 0}, "text-636": {"text": "Where do the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on the climate crisis?\nWith the California Democratic primary taking place on Super Tuesday this presidential season, the most populous, delegate-rich state in the US will have more influence than ever over choosing the party\u2019s nominee. That influence will reflect the particular priorities of California Democratic primary voters, who in a December poll named the climate crisis as their highest priority for the next president.\nIn the Golden state, climate priorities are not just a matter of lowering emissions and preventing further catastrophe, but also planning to adapt for the kinds of disasters Californians have come to know all too well. Rising seas lap at communities up and down the Pacific coast, and devastating wildfires since 2017 have killed more than 150 people and destroyed more than 35,000 structures.\nAll the candidates have pledged to end new fossil fuel operations on federal lands, after the Trump administration approved new leases for oil drilling on federal land in California in December. But how else do their plans compare on climate and California?\n Joe Biden\u2019s $5tn climate plan leans hard on his record as vice-president and role in passing the 2009 Recovery Act, which made the biggest investment in clean energy in US history. It calls for a new collaborative agency focused on climate and innovation and 100% net zero emissions by 2050.\nBiden\u2019s plan is unique in blaming urban sprawl for its impact on climate. He says he will work on altering local regulations to allow for denser housing near public transit to cut commute times and decrease the carbon footprint of sprawly areas. Policies like those have proven highly controversial in California, where the legislature has repeatedly rejected statewide zoning reforms that would promote denser, greener development. Biden\u2019s plan is unique in calling for the insurance industry to collaborate on lowering premiums for homeowners and communities that invest in resilience \u2013 particularly relevant for Californians who live in high wildfire risk areas and have faced soaring insurance premiums or loss of policies altogether.\nSince he entered the race late, Mike Bloomberg\u2019s policy proposals have escaped much of the scrutiny that other candidates have weathered. His climate plan pledges 80% clean energy by 2028 and 100% emission-free new passenger vehicles by 2035.\nBloomberg has a separate climate resilience plan, pledging to invest in underserved communities, prioritize the most vulnerable and mitigate climate hazards. And in an apparently continuation of the candidate\u2019s focus on California, there\u2019s also a specific wildfire resilience plan, by far the most extensive of any of the candidates\u2019 efforts, which would raise federal funding for fire resilience and management to $10bn, prevent insurers from dropping homeowners in high fire-risk areas and create a new \u201cwildfire corps\u201d with thousands of new jobs, all with the goal of reducing wildfire-caused loss of life and property by 50% by 2024.\nPete Buttigieg\u2019s $2tn climate plan pledges to reach net-zero electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions from industry by 2050. The plan calls for investments in clean technology and climate resilience alike.\nThe plan calls for establishing a National Catastrophic Extreme Weather Insurance program that would cover Americans facing climate-driven disasters and earthquakes \u2013 good news for Californians. \u201cThe government would also create an exchange for families to purchase catastrophic insurance subsidized by the government depending on income level,\u201d the plan reads. It also references the impacts of drought on California farmers, and disproportionate impacts on immigrant farmworkers specifically.\nAmy Klobuchar\u2019s climate plan includes a $1tn package of investment for climate research, tax incentives to spur research and development through public-private partnerships and other projects. She says she would bring back fuel economy standards, which have proven a serious point of contention as the Trump administration has weakened the standards for cars and light trucks and has challenged the right of California and other states to follow more stringent standards.\nKlobuchar wants to \u201cmobilize the heartland\u201d to build for climate resiliency. Her plan would upgrade levees for more frequent and severe floods in the midwest \u2013 but there\u2019s no plan for California fires.\nBernie Sanders is pitching a $16.3tn public investment to reduce emissions and prepare America for the impacts of climate crisis. His plan includes 100% renewable energy for electricity and transportation by 2030, and full decarbonization by 2050.\nSanders\u2019 climate plan includes a pledge to transition America\u2019s investor-owned utility companies to public ownership \u2013 a big dig at troubled PG&E. Extensive grants to purchase new electric vehicles would be a boost to California drivers, who are on the road more than the American average. The plan also a long section on firefighting, pledging to invest $18bn in the federal firefighting workforce. Community resiliency funding would go toward preparing for climate impacts, including wildfire evacuation plans, and additional sea walls \u2013 which, in California, have actually been known to contribute to coastal erosion.\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s $10tn climate plan calls for 100% net-zero emission electricity by 2035, 100% new clean vehicles by 2030, and 100% fossil-fuel-free new buildings by 2028 \u2013 the three industries she blames for making consumers think the climate crisis is their own fault for using plastic straws. The plan aims to create more than 10m green jobs. Those investments would prioritize frontline communities and environmental justice.\nOverall Warren\u2019s plan focuses on addressing the causes of climate change more than its impacts. While there is copious detail on how and why to transition the industries to blame, there\u2019s little to nothing on adaptation and community resiliency against the threats the candidate briefly outlines at the start of her plan.", "label": 0}, "text-637": {"text": "The Guardian view on the EU elections: a chance to reshape our politics\nNext week, voters across Europe face the most highly charged election to the European parliament in 40 years. In most of the previous five-yearly EU polls, political parties have struggled to engage the more than 400 million citizens who are entitled to vote. Past contests have regularly been fought on domestic rather than Europe-wide issues. Voters have often used their ballots as an opportunity to kick their own governments. Turnout has declined every time \u2013 down to 43% in 2014.\nThat trend may not \u2013 and certainly should not \u2013 continue next week. The 2019 elections, the first since the rise of populism, have been more confrontational. That\u2019s because there is more at stake for Europe today than before in the face of resurgent nationalism, and in a world marked by Chinese power, Russian aggression, American isolationism and Islamist terrorism.\nAlthough each country has faced its own form of nativist surge, these have also triggered a blowback. The 2019 contests have seen an overdue and more energised defence of the case for European cooperation against common threats. These threats range from monopolistic tech giants to the global climate emergency, against which individual states are far less powerful than the EU can be. Angela Merkel was right when she said this week that the new uncertainties \u201care forcing us, time and again, to find common positions\u201d.\nThis is the larger and enduring reality against which Britain\u2019s unplanned participation in these elections should be seen. Brexit or no Brexit, Britain will remain a European nation, subject to the same regional pressures as before. Member of the EU or not, Britain will have to respond to issues like climate crisis and security threats in cooperation with these neighbours and allies. And, unless the \u201courselves alone\u201d Brexit extremists take over in Britain \u2013 which they must not be permitted to do \u2013 our businesses, our industries, our scientists, our research and development teams and our individual citizens will remain intimately networked with theirs.\nFor Britain, these elections are squarely about our place in Europe. This is not a general election. It is a vote about whether Britain can play the part it should in the 21st-century world. The UK is only taking part next week because the Conservative government\u2019s Brexit project has fallen apart \u2013 talks with Labour which might have rescued it were called off on Friday \u2013 and the leavers\u2019 promises have been exposed as fantasies. Yet this is an opportunity to reclaim a place that we should never have abandoned. It is an opportunity \u2013 but only one step along the way \u2013 to help Britain take a better direction in Europe.\nIt is not an opportunity that has been seized as effectively as it could have been. The failure of the pro-European parties to form a popular front and adopt a single list and programme in these elections is regrettable. In the absence of that, the best alternative is to vote only for pro-European candidates who can be counted on to oppose the hard-Brexit terms on offer and to keep the issue open for a possible second referendum, and who stand a chance of winning under the proportional system in operation.\nThis means different things in the UK\u2019s 12 electoral regions. In many there are multiple pro-European options. They include the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, Change UK, the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Alliance. But pro-Europeans must be very careful to make their votes count. Labour\u2019s pro-European position is less simple. It is a party largely of remainers whose stance, in part the result of anxieties about its leave voters, is opaque. Many pro-Europeans understandably wish to vote Labour, but they should weigh candidates\u2019 records before taking what is something of a calculated risk.\nMore important, however, is to keep the big picture in mind. These elections are a chance to reshape British politics. They should be a rejection of Brexit, the parties that campaigned for it, and the parties that now want to impose the harshest version. In the rightwing narrative, these elections are all about the Brexit party and the battle for the Tory leadership. In a more balanced perspective, though, they are about something much bigger.

The prime minister claimed he would continue to shake hands with people he met, said the UK could send coronavirus \u201cpacking in 12 weeks\u201d and proclaimed that he would see his mother on Mothering Sunday despite social distancing rules.\nProblems with the strategy were addressed on Thursday by Cummings and his director of communications, Lee Cain. They held a virtual meeting with Levido at No 10 at which they invited him to take a major role in the government\u2019s strategy.\nThere have already been some cosmetic changes. On Monday Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, unveiled new bright yellow branding on the Downing Street podium, which drew comparisons with the arresting colour scheme used by NCP car parks and the posters for Reading and Leeds music festivals.\nAt the same time, there has been a willingness to slap down ministers who step away from the agreed line, much as in a general election campaign. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was contradicted by Downing Street on Monday after he advised people to shop for food only once a week.\nA raft of former advisers have been brought back to Whitehall to track public opinion and gauge whether the government\u2019s key messages on handwashing and self-isolation are getting through, including Gabriel Milland, a former head of news at the Department for Education under Michael Gove who is known for his experience running focus groups to refine messaging.\nBen Guerin, a 25-year-old online campaigner from New Zealand, is also expected to reprise his role as a strategist from December\u2019s successful election.\nA source said Levido was part of an effort to move the operation into a \u201ccampaigning mode\u201d, starting from last week, after a recognition that communication had not always been effective.\nA Whitehall insider said that Johnson and Cummings, both of whom are self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, have sought recruits who proved to be reliable operators in their victories at the general election and 2016 EU referendum.\n\u201cIt is a campaign to win over the public to the government\u2019s message. They have a proven track record,\u201d the source said.\nCummings\u2019 recent absence from Downing Street has cleared the way for the continued rise of Levido \u2013 a protege of Sir Lynton Crosby, and described by one friend as \u201cthe new Lynton\u201d. A long-time campaign obsessive, Levido now finds himself at the heart of the British government, shaping how Johnson\u2019s handling of the crisis is perceived by the public.\nDescribed as an intense, obsessive individual who is loyal to his team, he is known for pulling all-nighters and pushing rigid message discipline. He says he remains in close contact with Crosby, 63, according to individuals who worked on the Conservative election campaign. When the scale of the Tory victory at the election was revealed, others in the office began singing \u201cOh Isaac Levido\u201d to the tune of The White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army in recognition of his role.\nHailing from the New South Wales town of Port Macquarie, he previously worked on the 2015 and 2017 general election campaign, plus Zac Goldsmith\u2019s 2016 bid to be mayor of London. He has also done messaging for the likes of mining giant Glencore, according to sources, plus political campaigns from the Caribbean to Asia.\n\u201cHe hates the fiscal spending craziness,\u201d said one individual who knows Levido. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper conservative like Lynton.\u201d\nGuerin is one half of the Auckland-based social media campaigns business Topham Guerin, which has previously been exposed by the Guardian for its role helping to run Facebook astroturfing campaigns on behalf of major polluters. The pair are also former colleagues of Crosby and worked closely with Levido to re-elect Scott Morrison in Australia\u2019s general election.\nDuring the British general election campaign, Topham Guerin were in charge when the Conservatives deceptively rebranded their official press office account as FactCheck UK \u2013 while also taking particular delight in winding up those who reported on their online adverts creating \u201cboomer memes\u201d by issuing knowingly terrible parodies of their own work through official Conservative accounts.

They publicly support climate action while lobbying against binding policy. They advocate low-carbon solutions but such investments are dwarfed by spending on expanding their fossil fuel business.\u201d\nAfter the Paris climate agreement in 2015 the large integrated oil and gas companies said they supported a price on carbon and formed groups like the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative which promote voluntary measures.\nBut, the report states, there is a glaring gap between their words and their actions.\nThe five publicly listed oil majors \u2013 ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total \u2013 now spend about $195m a year on branding campaigns suggesting they support action against climate change.\nBut the report said these campaigns were misleading the public about the extent of the oil companies\u2019 actions because while publicly endorsing the need to act, they are massively increasing investment in a huge expansion of oil and gas extraction. In 2019 their spending will increase to $115bn, with just 3% of that directed at low carbon projects.\nShell said in a statement: \u201cWe firmly reject the premise of this report. We are very clear about our support for the Paris agreement, and the steps that we are taking to help meet society\u2019s needs for more and cleaner energy.\n\u201cWe make no apology for talking to policymakers and regulators around the world to make our voice heard on crucial topics such as climate change and how to address it.\u201d\nChevron said it disagreed with the report\u2019s findings. \u201cChevron is taking prudent, cost-effective actions and is committed to working with policymakers to design balanced and transparent greenhouse gas emissions reductions policies that address environmental goals and ensure consumers have access to affordable, reliable and ever cleaner energy.\u201d\nThe successful lobbying and direct opposition to policy measures to tackle global warming have hindered governments globally in their efforts to implement policies after the Paris agreement to meet climate targets and keep warming below 1.5C.", "label": 0}, "text-640": {"text": "As German health minister, I\u2019m championing both migration and patriotism\nWhen I was growing up in the 1990s, the liberal order was unquestioned. The US and Europe were home to stable liberal democracies; they were the role models worth aspiring to for the entire world. Today, I am the health minister in Angela Merkel\u2019s government and I\u2019m deeply concerned about the destabilisation of our societies. The biggest threats to our democracies are not external challengers like China or Russia. They are our internal frictions and divisions.\nThe situation throughout western societies is very similar: our debates have turned hostile. We have broken into ever-smaller groups; people dehumanise their opponents. We are too concerned about what might separate us instead of what unites us. Loyalties seem to lie with one\u2019s political tribe only. The results are fragmentation, polarisation and mutual hate. Internal cohesion is eroding, the capacity for international cooperation is diminishing.\nPolarisation unfolds along economic and cultural cleavages. In the UK and Germany, many have benefited economically from free trade, while others have not. In both countries some citizens embrace a cosmopolitan society, while others crave regional anchors of identity.\nThe most salient political issues are wealth redistribution and migration. Our strong welfare states lessen the economic polarisation to some extent. But this also leads to a prominent link between migration and redistribution: uncontrolled immigration into the welfare state can lead to support for redistribution mechanisms going down altogether. Even Milton Friedman once said that open borders are incompatible with a welfare state. So, our migration debates are very contested.\nEssentially, both debates are about identity. Two groups have formed. One deems western democracies responsible for global inequalities. They call for permeable borders to let less-developed world regions participate more directly in western wealth. They embrace a diverse and cosmopolitan society. The others feel threatened by social change as it questions their economic status and cultural anchors of identity. They call for stronger border regimes and a clearly defined national identity. The nation is a shelter in a fast-changing world.\nIn our multi-party system, big tent parties in the political centre can bridge these divisions. My party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), traditionally united progressive and conservatives. I am convinced that this is the most noble task for all democratic parties.\nI am also fully convinced that diverse societies must not fragment based on age, gender, sexuality, origin, race or religion. Quite the contrary: precisely because our societies grow more diverse, we need a unifying narrative bridging our supposed differences. The answer to diversity is not more tales about differences, but stories about commonalities. Our nations are the home we build together.\nWe Germans see patriotism more sceptically than those in the UK. The reasons are the atrocities the Nazis brought to Europe in the name of the German nation. Just seeing our national flag at party conventions creates an iffy feeling for many Germans.\nOur patriotism will always be much more cautious than its British counterpart. We will always commemorate the shadows of our past and remain firmly committed to European integration. However, a shared sense of belonging of all citizens within liberal democracies requires the emotional framework of the nation state. \nTo find a common identity bridging cosmopolitan and regional identities, I propose a weltoffener patriotismus. Weltoffen is tricky to translate into English. It roughly means being open-minded towards the world, open to new ideas and cultures. Weltoffener patriotismus does not make divisions based on ethnicity, but defines clear premises based on which everybody can join. If a nation is the home we build together, weltoffener patriotismus offers the foundation that everybody agreeing on a set of rules can stand on.\nHow does that translate into policy? As minister of health I am the only minister in my party, the CDU, dealing with welfare state issues. And health and nursing are key symbols of national unity because how we treat the sick and the elderly typifies how we define national solidarity.\nGermany is ageing rapidly. We need skilled migration to fill the gaps in our health and nursing sector and seek professionals from abroad. We are signing international agreements with Mexico, the Philippines and Kosovo. These countries boast many well-educated youngsters struggling to find a job who we want to invite to work in Germany. We are setting up a German agency for international healthcare professionals (GAP) to facilitate their transition.\nA conservative minister championing migration might sound odd. However, this is my understanding of weltoffener patriotismus. Our message to the people of Mexico, the Philippines and all other nations is: if you share our values and want to work with us, please feel cordially invited. Our message to the citizens of Germany reads: we can be proud of our free society, our values and cultures and national achievements. Not least of those made together with Germans whose parents and grandparents were born elsewhere.\nThe immigration of international professionals in the health and nursing sector is of benefit to migrants and Germans. It follows transparent procedures and is controlled by state agencies. It is embedded in government efforts to increase the pay and working conditions in the health and nursing sector so Germans do not feel pressures on their wages. At the same time, compulsory language acquisition and integration courses aim for a smooth transition into the German society.\nWe do not only aspire to fill the gap in our health and nursing sector but to also address the search for a unifying identity. Certainly, controlled skilled migration and thorough integration into society is only one step. But it exemplifies how to deal with emotional issues in a less polarising way: not focusing on diverging interests but on shared values; not separating groups, but bringing them together. Because we can be weltoffen and patriotic at the same time.\n\u2022 Jens Spahn is the German minister for health", "label": 0}, "text-641": {"text": "Environmentalism as Totalitarianism\nI see three motives that make it necessary to classify environmentalism among totalitarian ideologies in the strict sense.The first is that environmentalism does not make any secret of its will to control the entirety of human action.

I\u2019ve worked at Marlins Park at a concession stand for eight years, this will be the beginning of the ninth season.\u201d\nMike Dougherty: \u201cThere have been years where vending has earned me more than lawyering. Now about a third of my annual income is from vending. Vending has its up and down years depending on attendance and fan enthusiasm for the teams. This year, we were especially looking forward to the baseball season as the Minnesota Twins won their division last year and prospects were high for another good year. From what I have heard through the grapevine, advanced ticket sales are way up.\u201d\nRandi Trent: \u201cI work year-round at all three Philadelphia sports stadiums. When the basketball season ends, I start working at the Phillies Stadium, after that, it\u2019s football. My whole income revolves around Philadelphia sports. When a team goes to the playoffs, I make more money. Now that the NBA shut down, my income has dropped to zero.\u201d\nDuane Thwaites: \u201cI usually work during the home games. I would do 10 hours a day, easily. It\u2019s usually between 10-12 hours a day. Some weeks I don\u2019t work at all, and then there\u2019s some weeks where I do three to four games a week and I do 30-something to 48 hours. The [Miami Open tennis] was a good entry into the season. It usually lasted two weeks, I\u2019ve been doing it since it was at the Hard Rock Stadium, and after it got cancelled this year, everything pretty much went to hell.\u201d\nMike Dougherty: \u201cQuiet. We are on semi self-quarantine. We leave the house to run essential errands and walk the dog. With all entertainment venues closed it\u2019s about all we can do. We can\u2019t visit my mother at her assisted living facility, nor do we feel we can even visit friends and other family. We are getting a few chores and projects done around the house. My wife is a night nurse so she does go to work at night as we hope enough precautions are being taken at her hospital to mitigate the risk there.\u201d\nRandi Trent: \u201cSince getting laid off, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the phone with my coworkers helping them file for unemployment. I\u2019m trying not to stress \u2013 the utility companies are being lenient for now, but I know my bills are going to start piling up. I just came back from a medical leave so I don\u2019t have any more savings. I\u2019m a cancer survivor and I need healthcare. I pay $400 a month for insurance, $975 for rent. I don\u2019t know how long I can pay my bills on unemployment.\u201d\nDuane Thwaites: \u201cRight now? A lot of uncertainty. During the offseason, I normally go to my 70-year-old mom\u2019s house to take showers. Now I have to find another alternative to do that. I used to have an alternative where I had a gym membership and went to the gym to work out, but now all the gyms are closed, and so I\u2019m caught in a really hard place for something as simple as taking a shower. Plus, the uncertainty really has me because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. There\u2019s no money. AT&T still want their money for this phone, my car insurance still needs to be paid, and there\u2019s no money coming in, there\u2019s no work. Everything is still up in the air. People are saying we gonna get money, but nobody\u2019s explaining how or when.\u201d\nMike Dougherty: \u201cI have not received any word about the teams, employers, or athletes reaching out to help. I am kind of encouraged by words that some teams are stepping up, Mark Cuban [of the Dallas Mavericks] and Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves are individual owners I have heard say they are going to do something. But as for the teams I work with, the Twins, the Wild, and the Vikings, I have not heard anything about offers of assistance.\u201d\nRandi Trent: \u201cNo. I was on the shuttle back to the employee parking lot when I heard the news from a coworker that the NBA suspended the season. The next day I learned that the Wells Fargo Center was closed until further notice. We\u2019re waiting to hear what will happen next.\u201d\nDuane Thwaites: \u201cWe were informed via email. I believe it was last Thursday, saying it was official. We were actually in the process of training for the upcoming season. The [baseball] season was supposed to start on the 26th [of March] We just started basic training, alcohol, food, customer service training, and they only did two days, which was Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday got canceled and Thursday morning we got an email saying everything was canceled indefinitely. Nobody called or spoke to us directly.\u201d\nMike Dougherty: \u201cAs far as vending goes there are none. We can only wait until the crises ends. I do believe that when the games do start again, it will be a much-needed sign of a return to normalcy. Personally, I also am not sure if the agencies I work through for my day job will be manning any projects during this, and I don\u2019t know if I will be able to find any ancillary legal work I do, such as writing wills and reviewing contracts at a time when people may have more on their minds. But as my wife is in an essential health job she will be working so I take some solace that we will make it through. My bigger concern is with my fellow vendors and stadium workers, many of whom are more dependent on this work than I am.\u201d\nRandi Trent: \u201cWhere am I going to get a job? I\u2019ve been a server my whole career. No restaurants are open, let alone hiring anyone. I know that everyone is suffering right now and there\u2019s nothing my employer can do about the pandemic. But it\u2019s hard to be left in the lurch with no income. I know some teams have stepped up to the plate to pay their stadium workers and it would mean a lot to see that happen in Philadelphia.\u201d\nDuane Thwaites: \u201cIt\u2019s the reality for many of us that work these types of jobs, especially with the kind of work I\u2019m doing. I have background issues, it\u2019s not easy for me to get a job, so I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s left for me. I know some of my coworkers are just hoping that other part-time jobs will call them back to work, but for me there isn\u2019t too many at this moment.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: since the subjects of this article were interviewed, it was announced that some, but not all, workers at the Wells Fargo Center will be paid for games postponed during March.

They are crammed into makeshift shelters with little or no sanitation and limited access to the most basic services. There are \u201ccritical\u201d levels of malnutrition, according to an assessment by Somalia\u2019s food security and nutrition analysis unit.\nScattered over 700 sites across the capital, families mainly consisting of women and children share common latrines and survive on one meal a day.\nLast week, Goobjoog News, a local radio station in Mogadishu, reported that about a dozen children had died of starvation in one encampment in Kahda district. Among them, said the station, were young twins whose mother had been killed in last month\u2019s truck bomb explosion.\nEvery morning, women from the these camps head into the city centre, looking for casual jobs such as clothes washing. With no family or clan connections to the local host community, they face abuse and sexual exploitation.\nMogadishu, second on Demographia\u2019s 2015 ranking of the fastest growing cities in the world, has limited capacity to integrate such a large number of displaced people into its urban development system.\n\u201cThe most significant challenge posed by conflict and natural disaster induced displacement is its impact on rapid and unplanned urbanisation and the rural exodus,\u201d said Dr Hodan Ali, head of Benadir regional administration\u2019s durable solutions unit.\n\u201cMogadishu is emerging from 30 years of conflict. The infrastructure, basic services and local government capacity are extremely limited and, as such, its ability to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and impoverished members of the city is small.\u201d\nCapitalising on the gap left by a weak government and the lack of a formal camp management system, an illicit business has sprung up, with \u201cgatekeepers\u201d soliciting land for new arrivals, linking them up with aid agencies, and in return taking a cut of what little aid they may receive.\nHumanitarian organisations with limited access to the camps due to security restrictions are left with little choice but to collaborate with the unofficial gatekeepers, in effect paying \u2013 and empowering \u2013 illicit middlemen.\nMore people arrive in Mogadishu daily, driven to the city by multiple climate shocks and violence between al-Shabaab, Amisom and the Somali national forces. Last year alone, more than 100,000 people arrived in the capital, many of them returnees from refugee camps in Kenya and Yemen.\nNationally, over 2.6 million Somalis are displaced within the country, with Mogadishu hosting the largest concentration of people forced from their homes. Many in the city have not had a permanent home since the civil war broke out in 1991.\nHowever, with funding from donors including the UK government and EU, the local authority has been trying to strengthen its urban resilience capacity to absorb and integrate the city\u2019s mass displacement camps. The Mogadishu municipality established a dedicated durable solutions unit in the mayor\u2019s office and last year developed a policy for internally displaced people.\nSomalia\u2019s overall humanitarian situation remains critical, with more than 5 million people in need of assistance according to figures jointly released by the UN and federal government of Somalia. The recent flooding in many parts of the country, which affected over half a million people, has compounded the already dire humanitarian crisis.\nLast Monday, the durable solutions unit launched a five-year strategy to address the growing number of displaced people in the region.\n\u201cThe strategy over the next five years focuses on strengthening local government to respond to the basic and protection needs of its citizens in good time, with adequate resources and be accountable to the people,\u201d said Ali.\nHowever, the greatest immediate uncertainty for people displaced to Mogadishu remains forceful evictions, since most are staying on private land. Last year alone, more than 100,000 people were pushed off temporary settlements.\n\u201cWe hope to ensure that even in the first year of the strategy, we see a minimum of 30,000 people who are now displaced move out of the displacement towards development,\u201d said Ali, speaking at the launch event.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge we have in Mogadishu is that the majority of the investment goes into aid and handouts. I don\u2019t think that is an effective way of utilising hundreds of millions of dollars and having to see the conditions we have in the camps.\n\u201cSo it is really important to pull all these resources to have one common output. We hope to have more engagements and discussions with our international partners to ensure that we are all working for the same goal.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-646": {"text": "The old made our climate mess. And the young will get us out of it\nWorld leaders are meeting in Spain to decide whether or not to bother with preventing the destruction of the earth, like people in a vehicle speeding toward a cliff deciding whether to brake or swerve or just chat about other things. Powerful senior citizens in the United States \u2013 Trump, Giuliani, Biden \u2013 are trading playground insults, and the middle-aged people who make a lot of decisions about how to handle this emergency seem incapable of thinking beyond the singularly imagination-killing criterion of short-term profit.\nI began writing this column at a Youth v Apocalypse demonstration in San Francisco. The protest, which was led by teens, of course, as well as some of the 20-something members of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion, took place in front of Black Rock, the world\u2019s largest investor in fossil fuels. There was a little cluster of mothers at the demonstration too, with babies and toddlers whose life expectancy, barring catastrophes, extends into the 22nd century. It was a Fridays for Future demonstration taking place all over the world, with half a million mostly young people in Madrid.\nSometimes I think that our species was for most of its history a child: it had limited capacity to harm and thus limited responsibility to do no harm. We could kill each other, but we did it without napalm and nuclear weapons that kill a lot of other things. We could think small because we acted small, mostly; we were altering the earth with hunting, grazing, farming, foraging, building, but most of our traces would vanish and most of our impact left no lasting damage.\nWe must expand our imaginations so can experience real climate victory. That means making radical changes\nWith the industrial revolution and its reliance on fossil fuels and with technologies capable of changing the earth on a more profound scale, childhood harmlessness faded into the past for those who wielded those powers and used those tools and benefitted from it all. Humans ceased to be human-scale, but our imaginations and ethics lagged behind our impact. We have for two centuries been in a sort of wild adolescence, too reckless and impatient to pay attention to consequences or to listen to the Rachel Carsons and Vandana Shivas when they point out that there are consequences. Because, really, environmentalism has been to no small degree about shouting \u201cdon\u2019t break that\u201d and \u201cclean up your room\u201d at corporations and governments.\nWe are on the brink, and part of what that brink is, I believe, is the necessary end of that adolescence. As a species we must act with restraint in the face of consequences, must consider the other species with us now, those of our own not yet born, and those currently facing ultimate climate vulnerability around the world from floods, fire, sea level rise, crop failure, superstorms and more.\nWe must expand our imaginations and act on that bigger understanding of our place in the world and our impact on the future. That means making radical changes, like our homes and transit being powered by renewables, our government not plotting more extractivism. It means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, where they belong. We need to remind ourselves why these changes are necessary: that the earth is finite, that actions have consequences, that they go beyond the horizon of what we can see and hear, in time and space, that those who come after us have rights we can\u2019t just annihilate. We must make sweeping changes by the end of the coming decade, and we must stick to them afterward by remembering why they matter.\nWhat is striking in this moment is that such maturity is largely the property of the young. Many of the significant grownups in the room of climate chaos are 16 or 20 or 27, Greta and the thousands of youths like her who are less visible but no less committed, the teens from Nigeria to Alaska doing their utmost for the climate. But because they are truly young, they control no shares, have no votes, sit on no boards: they need us as we need them. They are the leadership in this moment, the people who are thinking about 2100, the people who are ready to change everything, the people who understand the gravity and scale of the catastrophe.\nThey are the people who have never experienced a below-average temperature on Earth, who have the capacity to recognise we are in an emergency. There is wisdom in youth, in its lack of attachment to the status quo that is not their status quo, and in its ability to imagine profound change.\nThere have been farsighted altruistic people in every generation, but there are signs of a wider evolution of imagination that is taking place among the young. We see that profound change in new ways of dealing with conflict, with rejecting competition and capitalism, new understandings of what is possible and ethical. We see the children are mature and too many old people are juvenile (though bless Jane Fonda at 81 for her #FireDrillFriday protests). Juvenility and maturity are no longer categories attached to how long you\u2019ve been on Earth, but how far you see and how much you care.\nRebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist", "label": 0}, "text-647": {"text": "Banning fans' free speech is not consistent with our vision of sport. Or democracy\n\u201cPush \u2018em back, push \u2018em back, waaay back!\u201d is a classic American football chant encouraging the players to muscle the opposition back down the field. Today\u2019s fan participation is a lot more complicated, especially after Major League Soccer recently banned a group of Portland Timbers fans from attending three matches at Providence Park for waving flags that displayed the anti-fascist Iron Front symbol (this weekend, Seattle Sounders fans walked out of a match in protest at the ban on \u201cpolitical\u201d banners). Now when we yell that nostalgic \u201cPush \u2018em back\u201d cheer we have to ask more complicated questions, such as who does \u201c\u2019em\u201d refer to: the opposing team, the owners, or the fans? By \u201cpush\u201d do you mean to bully people \u2013 owners, non-political fans, outspoken fans \u2013 out of their rights? And by \u201cway back\u201d do you mean back out of the stadium or back to the 1950s when politics and sports rarely crossed paths?\nFor 50 years, I have been an outspoken supporter of athletes\u2019 right to silently protest during sporting events. Whether it\u2019s raising a fist, as Tommie Smith and John Carlos did during the 1968 Olympics, or Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem, or LeBron James wearing an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirt while warming up for a game, athletes have a constitutional right to express their outrage over social injustice in the hopes of improving lives. Clearly, fans should have those same rights. But no one\u2019s rights are absolute when the act of expressing them may restrict someone else\u2019s rights. So, when championing the fans\u2019 rights in this situation, there are a few considerations that have to be acknowledged.\nAthletes who protest during sports events have traditionally done so silently. Their act is designed to raise public awareness to inspire positive change while being respectful of the game. They do nothing to interfere with the sporting event, which would infringe on the fans\u2019 rights. Although some owners and fans claim that any reminder of politics hurts their enjoyment, that\u2019s an unreasonable reaction to the relatively brief and unobtrusive expression of constitutional rights on behalf of those marginalized people being denied their rights.\nThe first problem with the stance that sporting events should be non-political is that the playing of the national anthem itself introduces politics into the sporting event. It\u2019s blatantly pandering in an effort to associate the event with patriotism, akin to a politician kissing a baby or petting a puppy. It\u2019s like telling a fan, \u201cYou\u2019re being patriotic just by being here, slurping beer and chomping a hot dog.\u201d Before 2009, NFL players weren\u2019t required to even come out of the locker room for the playing of the anthem. In 2015, a joint oversight report revealed that $5.4m of taxpayer money had been paid to 14 NFL teams between 2011 and 2015 for displays of \u201cpatriotic salutes\u201d to the military. Between 2012 and 2015, the US department of defense spent at least $10.4m on \u201cmarketing and advertising contracts with professional sports teams.\u201d This isn\u2019t patriotism by the teams, it\u2019s commerce. There is nothing patriotic about a ball passing over a goal-line or through a hoop and we shouldn\u2019t sanctify our games as a litmus test of who deserves to express their opinions. Teams should have the right to make such deals, but they shouldn\u2019t then suppress free speech while they\u2019re busy selling the right to speak to the highest bidder.\nWhat leagues can do is insist that expressions of political allegiance are maintained within consistent parameters that insure they don\u2019t interfere with fans watching the event they paid to enjoy. By consistent, I mean that if a stadium allows American flags or team banners to be waved or displayed, then they should allow political flags and banners of the same size to be waved by fans, as long as they don\u2019t promote symbols of hate and violence, such as swastikas. Certainly, if fans held up large banners that blocked the view of other spectators, that would be a violation. But if you allow a MAGA hat or t-shirt then you have to allow an Iron Front hat or t-shirt.\nTeam owners have expressed fear that the interjection of politics, no matter how noble the purpose, will alienate their fanbase. Part of this fear was stoked by President Trump\u2019s tweets in 2017, at the height of player protests, that the NFL ratings were \u201cWAY DOWN\u201d and that \u201cThe American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem.\u201d Not surprisingly, this was false. The NFL increased its revenue by 5% in 2017. When Nike launched an ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the conventional wisdom chortled that Nike would take a huge commercial hit from that mysterious and feared fanbase that hates free speech. It didn\u2019t happen. Instead, Nike\u2019s sales rose by 10%.\nFear is the greatest enemy of free speech and facts are the greatest cure to that fear. Thomas Jefferson urged us to \u201ceducate and inform the whole mass of the people\u2026 They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.\u201d But, with so many Russian trolls disseminating false information in an effort to sway our elections, with a president who lies on a daily basis, with news outlets like Fox News that have been proven to report misinformation, and with most people restricting their input of information to sources they already agree with, sometimes the only way to convey an opposing opinion to the population at large is through public gatherings. Which is why it\u2019s all the more important to make sure those avenues of expression stay open.\nOne of the reasons we embrace sports so dearly is that they can symbolize human interaction at its most noble: fair play, meritocracy, sportsmanship, competitiveness, striving to be better, pushing the limits of human achievement. Curtailing the free speech of athletes or fans is not consistent with our vision of sports. Or our vision of democracy.\nYou can read a full archive of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s articles for the Guardian here.", "label": 0}, "text-648": {"text": "energy costs are at the root of climate change policy disagreements\n\"By withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement President Trump has put the burden of proof on those private investors and nation states that believe renewable energy is economically beneficial.

The images come thick and fast: black, white, pony-tailed, hijabed, older, younger, somewhere in the middle, to the glorious strains of Barbra Streisand belting out Don\u2019t Rain on My Parade.\nDo you notice any wrinkles, any dimples in their thighs? Hell, no! And if you do \u2013 this ain\u2019t for you. This is for all those many women out there who avoid exercise because of that very fear, the fear of being judged.\nThe film is part of the latest phase of Sport England\u2019s game-changing This Girl Can campaign, an attempt to close the gender gap between the number of men and women who are physically active. You might remember the first ad screened during Coronation Street on a Monday night in January 2015, to the soundtrack of Missy Elliot\u2019s Get Ur Freak On and then shown in cinemas and online, with accompanying billboard ads: \u201cI kick balls. Deal with it\u201d, and \u201cHot and not bothered\u201d.\nThere was something moving about watching normal women of all shapes and sizes exercise and have fun, get sweaty and look knackered. Why? Because it was so rare to see in the media, let alone in such a joyful way. I had a quiet weep when I first watched it and I wasn\u2019t alone.\nJennie Price, the multi-award-winning outgoing chief executive of Sport England and the brains behind This Girl Can, cried, too. \u201cAnd I never cry.\u201d It was then that Price knew that she might have something special on her hands.\nPrice arrived at Sport England 11 and a half years ago from outside the sporting world. \u201cMost people who work in sport have either worked in it all their lives or been exceptionally good at it. I was in my 40s, I\u2019d always been very average at sport. I knew what it was like to be picked last. It wasn\u2019t a bad background to have.\n\u201cJust before I joined an old colleague said to me: \u2018The thing about sport is that you\u2019re either in or you\u2019re out.\u2019 And that really stayed with me.\u201d\nWhen research revealed that 75% of women would like to do more exercise but that there was a huge emotional barrier \u2013 fear of judgment \u2013 as well as the usual suspects of expense and lack of time, the This Girl Can campaign was born. It immediately resonated with people, with the hashtag This Girl Can going on to transcend sport. And, most importantly, it worked \u2013 with strong evidence that it has had a sustained effect on women\u2019s activity. Nearly three million women were inspired by the campaign to be more active, Sport England\u2019s research suggests, and 1.5 million women either started or restarted exercise because of it.\nBut it didn\u2019t reach everyone. Many women, feedback showed, thought that although the campaign looked all very nice, it wasn\u2019t the reality of their lives. Hence phase three: Fit Got Real, which aims to inspire women who exercise the least, those in routine or low-income jobs, and black and south Asian women. The message this time is every little counts, no expensive Lycra required.\nPrice sees images like those in the Fit Got Real film as vital. \u201cIn a world of Instagram, to see sweaty and scruffy is incredibly powerful.\u201d\nBut it is not just normal women doing sport who miss out on representation. There is a sore dearth of images of women on the sports pages of newspapers too.\nLast year Totally Runable \u2013 an organisation that works in schools with girls and female sports staff \u2013 conducted an experiment. Between July 2017 and June 2018, they looked at nine national papers one day a month and took note of what photographs were used. In total they found 3,107 pictures of people doing sport. Of those, five were of men and women together, 3,011 were of men \u2013 and just 91 were of women: 2.9% of the total.\nOn the worst day of their survey, during September 2017, there were 365 pictures of men doing sport and one solitary photograph of a woman. No paper covered itself in glory over the year \u2013 the Guardian topped the poll with 9.8% of the pictures in its sports section featuring women, the Star, the Mirror and the Mail had less than 2%, while the Sun languished at the bottom with 0.8%.\nAnd even when sportswomen were pictured, photographs often showed them in a dress picking up an award, or draped in a flag \u2013 not actually doing the thing they were famous for.\nNatalie Jackson, director of Totally Runable, was not surprised by the results. \u201cThere is still a long way to go. We know from the work we do in schools that by age seven girls are 22% less likely than boys to call themselves very sporty. But is it any wonder? If they can\u2019t see it, it is much harder for them to be it.\u201d In response, she\u2019s launched #SeeSportyBeSporty, calling for sport in the media to be more gender equal.\nNewspaper desks say that women\u2019s sports don\u2019t always help themselves.

It commissioned accountancy and business advisory firm BDO to carry out a detailed investigation after it found \u201csubstantial\u201d VAT errors totalling \u00a312m.\nThe company said in August the investigation had uncovered \u201cimproper behaviour\u201d by a number of individuals since at least 2010.\nSports Direct warned on Monday that if the delisting goes ahead, Goals shareholders will be unable to influence the sale process.\nSports Direct, which first invested in Goals in 2015, said: \u201cSports Direct believes that due to Goals\u2019 well-publicised difficulties the board of Goals is not committed to maintaining Goals\u2019 trading facility.\n\u201cInstead, it seems only interested in pursuing the [sale] process whilst, at the same time through the loss of the trading facility, depriving Goals\u2019 shareholders of the ability to vote on it.

But with specific reagents in short supply, senior researchers told the Guardian that the UK must find alternatives to avoid more delays, with one arguing: \u201cThese are not normal times.\u201d\nTheir plea came as the prime minister was forced to address mounting anger about the government\u2019s failure to increase testing, just weeks after it had appeared to rule out such a strategy. Ministers have been consistently flummoxed by questions on the issue.\nIn a video message posted on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Boris Johnson said the country need to \u201cmassively ramp up\u201d the two separate tests that show whether people have, or have had, the disease.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial people who do have the disease are able to be tested positive and to take the necessary steps to isolate at home in the way that I am doing and many, many others are doing,\u201d he said.\nThe UK\u2019s poor testing figures compared with other nations have caused a huge political backlash, with critics asking why the government is both failing to source the right equipment and refusing to agree to expand testing to the general population.\nOnly around 8,000 hospital patients and NHS staff are being tested daily \u2013 well short of the government\u2019s targets and far below the 70,000 a day achieved in Germany. In total, just 2,000 NHS workers \u2013 or 0.4% of those being exposed to the virus \u2013 have been tested so far, meaning thousands in isolation cannot get back to work.\nMinisters have struggled for four days in a row at No 10\u2019s daily press conference to explain why testing is so slow. In an attempt to solve another logistical barrier, NHS England also directed all trusts to lift the 15% cap on staff testing and use all their spare testing capacity to help solve the problem.\nBut Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, said that efforts to scale up testing were being frustrated by over-reliance on specified reagents, enzymes and other chemicals. \u201cIt is holding things up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that\u2019s got to be a good thing.\n\u201cThe NHS have very specific requirements and there is good reason for that. It makes sure that standards are maintained. But there are alternatives. They need to be optimised and validated, but you can fast-track that if you have enough people. It wouldn\u2019t take a lot of time.\u201d\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced last week that the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests. But the Guardian understands the UK has actually put in orders for up to 40m.\nDr Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the non-profit Geneva-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, a WHO collaboration centre, told the Guardian presidents and prime ministers were trying to outbid each other to secure testing kits. \u201cIn all countries we have prime ministers calling the CEOs and diagnostic companies to try to get hold of the stocks,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIndonesia and Peru we know have offered to order several million tests and send private planes to pick the tests up. There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies.\u201d\nUniversities have received a flurry of urgent calls from the government to assist in scaling up virus testing. Weeks ago, certain enzymes were in short supply. More recently, requests came in for chemicals that release the virus\u2019s genetic code, the first step in the process of detecting the virus in swab samples.\n\u201cThe protocols say they want specific types of reagent for that, but there are lots of ways to do it, there are many reagents you can use,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cWe can do this, and with appropriate controls, the risks are low and the benefits could be high.\u201d\nThe stringent rules around test chemicals and equipment are designed to ensure that tests are reliable and consistent across the NHS. The health service benefits because it can order in bulk from a single supplier at a preferential rate. But the procedures are so prescriptive that all laboratories can end up using the same equipment, suppliers and chemicals, so when demand spikes, there are no other approved products to use.\n\u201cOn a normal day, this works,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cBut these are not normal times. At the moment we need to ramp up testing.\n\u201cResearch labs, which tend to operate in a much less regimented manner, have the skills, equipment and quite possibly sufficient reagents to contribute to this effort,\u201d she went on. \u201cThey won\u2019t be exactly the same items that Public Health England use, but they will work just as well. Research labs are also very used to working to validate their data across labs to ensure their data are comparable to that of their colleagues.\u201d\nThe British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, BIVDA, said the problem was a shortage of reagent kits in the global supply chain. While manufacturers are producing the kits as rapidly as they can, the firms are having to prioritise what products are shipped where.\nStonehouse said chemicals were not the only hurdle that scientists faced in trying to help in the acceleration of testing. A large swath of university-trained researchers have volunteered to run testing equipment, but have been held up amid legal concerns about having them working at NHS and other testing facilities. \u201cThis seems to be stopping things going forwards,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s an overreaction. We have staff in ITU who have not worked in intensive care before because we need them there. We need that flexibility on testing.\u201d\nLabour called on Wednesday for Boris Johnson to publish a clear \u201cnational testing strategy\u201d that sets out exactly how the government plans to expand its programme in the coming weeks.\nAs well as coming under fire over the logistical problems, No 10 and its advisers are facing questions about why they are refusing to commit to a future strategy of mass testing of the general population as well as of NHS workers and patients in hospitals.\nPublic health experts have warned that mass testing for live cases of the virus is essential if the UK wants to ease the lockdown, arguing that it will be necessary to find any new hotspots and suppress them using aggressive quarantining and contact tracing methods.\nJonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, told the Guardian: \u201cThe government claims to have abandoned its herd immunity strategy, but without clear testing, many are asking what our strategy actually is.\u201d\nAlok Sharma, the business secretary, was the latest minister to decline to confirm that moving to mass testing was part of the agenda as he appeared at the No 10 press conference on Wednesday, with Boris Johnson still in isolation.\nPublic Health England has repeatedly emphasised that wider testing to see who is immune is a greater priority, but this does not find people who are currently infectious.\nYvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, said on Wednesday that the government wanted testing to go \u201cfrom the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands\u201d, although the intended split between tests for live cases of the virus and immunity is not clear.", "label": 0}, "text-653": {"text": "Morning mail: voter anger over sports scandal, Canberra bushfire, biohacking\nGood morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 29 January.\nFifty-one percent of voters believe Scott Morrison should have sacked the Bridget McKenzie over her handling of the $100m sports rorts affair, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll.

Speaking on behalf of people skeptical of an asserted global warming crisis, I accept the invitation.\nBassam Shakhashiri, a professor at the ultra-liberal University of Wisconsin-Madison and Distinguished Chair of the \u201cprogressive\u201d group the Wisconsin Idea, along with his University of Wisconsin-Madison colleague Jerry Bell, write, \u201cCommunicating the science of climate change provides one example where the scientific community must do more. Climate change affects everyone, so everyone should understand why the climate is changing and what it means for them, their children, and generations to follow.\u201d\nLet us begin this important conversation now.\nIn their article, Shakhashiri and Bell claim \u201cthe average temperature of the Earth is increasing.\u201d Well, not during the past decade the temperature hasn\u2019t. NASA and NOAA satellite data show the Earth\u2019s temperature has not risen at all for more than a decade. This has occurred even though global carbon dioxide emissions rose by a third during the past 10 years.\u00a0 If carbon dioxide is truly the primary driver of global temperature change, why has there been no warming during the past decade?\nGlobal warming activists will often reply that we should look at the past century rather than the past decade when assessing global temperatures. Fair enough. At least half of the global warming of the 20th century occurred prior to the post-World War II economic boom. Global carbon dioxide emissions were minimal during the pre-World War II era. Again, this argues against carbon dioxide emissions being the primary driver of global temperature, and argues against economically ruinous \u201cprogressive\u201d programs to restrict carbon dioxide emissions.\nMore importantly, we should look at the past several thousand years, rather than merely the past century, when assessing the context of current temperatures. The Earth\u2019s current temperature, when assessed in proper context, is relatively cool right now. Today\u2019s temperatures are cooler than those that prevailed during most of the past 10,000 years, when human civilization first developed and thrived. Temperatures during the past century only seem warm when compared with the Little Ice Age, which brought about the coldest temperatures of the past 10,000 years and ended just over a century ago.\nShakhashir and Bell claim \u201cice is melting.\u201d If global temperatures finally warm from the extreme cold of the Little Ice Age, we can certainly expect some of the unusually prevalent ice to melt. But is ice melting at an alarming rate? Not according to NASA and NOAA satellite data. In fact, NASA and NOAA satellite instruments show polar sea ice has remained relatively steady since the satellite instruments were launched in 1979, and polar sea ice is currently more extensive than the long-term average.\nShakhashir and Bell claim \u201coceans are acidifying.\u201d The oceans are alkaline, not acidic. The oceans have a pH of 8.1, which is far above the neutral pH of 7.0. To the extent ocean alkalinity may have declined from 8.2 to 8.1 during the past century, the oceans are becoming less alkaline, not more acidic.\nMore importantly, marine life \u2013 like terrestrial plant life \u2013 is benefiting from higher carbon levels. Several peer-reviewed studies document plankton, sea stars, crustaceans and other marine life thrive and grow more rapidly in ocean water with higher carbon content and less alkalinity.\nShakhashir and Bell claim \u201cextreme weather events are more frequent.\u201d If Shakhashir and Bell define \u201cextreme weather events\u201d as a remarkable decline in drought, a remarkable increase in soil moisture, a remarkable decline in strong tornadoes and a remarkable decline in hurricane strikes, they are correct. However, if they define \u201cextreme weather events\u201d the way most other people in the world define the term, they are irrefutably wrong.\u00a0 As temperatures continue to recover from the depths of the Little Ice Age, droughts are less frequent and severe, global soil moisture is improving, strong tornadoes are in long-term decline, and hurricane strikes are becoming less frequent.\nShakhashiri and Bell assert we should have more climate change conversations. I agree, especially considering the scientific evidence debunks global warming alarmism. Messieurs Shakhashiri and Bell, you name the time, place and venue, and I will be happy to oblige you in considering this climate change conversation.\nJames M.

There are two particular types \u2013 the hypocrisy where politicians pretend they care about something and then do nothing, and the one where they pretend to think something and do the opposite.\nWe have seen it this week with former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop suddenly discovering climate change.\nShe told Guardian Australia \u201cthat I\u2019ve always been of the view that Australia, as a leading industrialised and developed nation, with one of the best standards of living in the world, needs to be a leader in the international response to climate change\u201d.\nThe nation as one responded with a resounding, \u201cSeriously, what?\u201d\nName one instance during her time as foreign minister or even just as a member of the Howard or Abbott-Turnbull governments where she ever proffered such a view or supported such a policy position.\nHer very last mention of \u201cclimate change\u201d in parliament came in 2017 when she lovingly talked up \u201chigh efficiency, low emissions\u201d coal plants and decried in loud tones the ALP\u2019s \u201cobsession with a 50% renewable energy target\u201d which she said was \u201cdestroying business confidence in South Australia, threatening jobs and threatening industries\u201d.\nGotta love that leadership.\nOr perhaps she was leading in 2015 when she told parliament: \u201cI think it is important not to engage in hyperbole when one is talking about climate change. I remember in 2011 when the deputy leader [Tanya Plibersek] tried to scare the senior citizens on the Central Coast by saying that they were going to be subject to the ravages of climate change.\u201d\nOr maybe she suggested being a \u201cleader in the international response\u201d was what she was doing when she told parliament that the government\u2019s 26% to 28% target of emissions cuts, \u201cis a responsible contribution\u201d and that \u201cwhat is not responsible is Labor\u2019s endorsement of a carbon reduction target of up to 60% on 2000 levels by 2030\u201d.\nDo nothing but say you care about doing lots.\nThe other hypocrisy was writ large across the LNP this week with regards to the budget surplus.\nGone is the boasting of a surplus already delivered, now the Treasurer says \u201cwell the surplus has never been an end in itself\u201d and \u201cdelivering a surplus has not been our priority in the face of these crises\u201d and \u201cour focus is on is not necessarily delivering the surplus\u201d.\nLast year, when David Speers questioned Frydenberg about the government\u2019s boast of delivering a surplus that had actually yet to happen, Speers suggested \u201cthere might be a collapse in China, there might be another terrible drought \u2026 things can happen that could prevent you actually achieving this\u201d.\nThe treasurer responded by arguing: \u201cWell this is not a wafer thin surplus. This is a very significant surplus.\u201d\nDon\u2019t expect to hear such arguments being made now.\nNow the talk is of things outside the control of the government \u2013 indeed they will use all the arguments they criticised the ALP for making when the GFC smashed the economy and the budget.\nHypocrisy? Yep.\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2013 we actually want them to be hypocrites, it is better for the nation if they are \u2013 so long as it is this brand of hypocrisy.\nThe absolute worst thing the government could do right now is desperately try to deliver a surplus.\nForget stories such as those that appeared on the front page of the Australian this week about new taxes \u2013 nothing on the revenue side will help the government now because any new taxes will only come into effect next financial year at the earliest.\nBut they can stop spending right now.\nThe only reason the government has been able to project a surplus is because they project that they will be awash with tax revenue.\nThe government was not projecting a budget surplus because of big austerity campaigns, but because of factors outside their control that looked set to deliver a massive increase in tax.\nIn the face of less than expected revenue, the only way to still deliver a surplus is to cut government spending \u2013 but that would further reduce economic activity and thus further reduce revenue, which would necessitate further cuts.\nThe smart thing to do is to accept a budget deficit, because that will help keep the economy afloat.\nWill the government attempt to sell such a move with hypocritical statements? For sure. But that is better than the alternative.\nAnd so it is with climate change.\nMembers of the LNP have spent more than a decade warning about not getting ahead of the rest of the world, or that a carbon price is actually a tax, or that we need to think more about adaptation than lowering emissions, or that electric cars will kill weekends or that renewable energy will deliver blackouts.\nIt would be a measure of gross hypocrisy for them now to start shouting about the need to do more on emissions, that we need to lead the world and we need to put a price on carbon and to stop faffing about.\nThe LNP account for around 99% of everyone in Australian politics who is to blame for the lost decade of climate change policy inaction.\nWere they to turn around now and argue there is no time to waste, we would be able to fill the MCG with print outs of transcripts that demonstrate their hypocrisy.\nAnd yet, bring it on.\nBecause while hypocrisy should be addressed, I would much prefer the hypocrisy of a Liberal party pretending that their past actions did not contradict their new outlook on climate change than the current version we have of the LNP saying we need to do something but then purposefully and perpetually doing the opposite.\nThe hypocrisy of their position on the budget surplus looks to have been forced on them. With luck all sides may use this as a moment to remember that it is actually true that \u201cthe surplus has never been an end in itself\u201d.\nAnd on climate change we can only hope the LNP discover a new fragrance of hypocrisy.\nYes it would be best if they were to admit their errors, and apologise for the past decade of waste that has cost us all so greatly.\nBut if they start to act on reducing emissions and actually do attempt to lead the world, then I\u2019ll take the emissions cuts and live with the hypocrisy.", "label": 0}, "text-656": {"text": "no transparency keeps climate hysyterics finding in the dark\nProfessor Larry Bell posts at 'Newsmax': \"As one researcher prudently observed, 'It is inconceivable that policymakers will be willing to make billion-and trillion-dollar decisions for adaptation to the projected regional climate change based on models that do not even describe and simulate the processes that are the building blocks of climate variability.'\"", "label": 1}, "text-657": {"text": "seven revealing charts trace history of climate for last decade\nIn this post, Anthony Watts of the highly regarded blog WattsUpWithThat shows seven charts relating to climate behaviour in the United States during the decade recently concluded, that expose the fallacies propagated by the catastrophycisists who preach \"dangerous global warming\".", "label": 1}, "text-658": {"text": "Too hot for humans?

It\u2019s late afternoon and only 31C \u2013 a reprieve from a run of days in the high 30s and 40s.\nBut Douglas knows that from now on it will only get hotter.\nLast summer was the hottest on record, and the driest in 27 years in central Australia. Five per cent of the town\u2019s street trees died. A heat monitoring study showed that on some unshaded streets the surface temperature was between 61C and 68C.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going on the way we\u2019re going,\u201d says Douglas, who is manager of policy and research at the Central Land Council.\n\u201cCentral Australian Aboriginal people are very resilient. They have evolved to cope with the harsh and variable desert climate, but there are limits.\n\u201cWithout action to stop climate change, people will be forced to leave their country and leave behind much of what makes them Aboriginal. Climate change is a clear and present threat to the survival of our people and their culture.\u201d\nAcross central Australia, people are bracing themselves for another scorching summer of drought.\nAt least nine remote communities and outstations are running out of water. A further 12 have reported poor quality drinking water as aquifers run low and the remaining supply is saline. \nTemperature records have already been broken. In the year to July 2019, Alice Springs had 129 days over 35C, and 55 days over 40C.\nIt wasn\u2019t meant to be like this \u2013 at least, not yet. The national science agency, the CSIRO, predictedthat these temperatures would not arrive until 2030.\nAs the Northern Territory\u2019s environment minister, Eva Lawler, said last September: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, the NT will become unliveable.\u201d\nThe problem is where to start.\nIn Alice Springs opinion is divided among local politicians about the impact climate change is having on life in the desert.\nSitting on the grassy lawn outside the council, Jimmy Cocking of the Arid Lands Environment Centre talks openly about climate refugees: those who have already come into town, and those who will have to come in the near future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up with a whole bunch of internally displaced people within the Northern Territory in remote Australia, if we\u2019re not planning for that,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIf regional centres like Alice Springs and others aren\u2019t planning to be able to deal with the influx of climate refugees internally within our region, we\u2019re going to be left flatfooted and unable to deal with any of the challenges and social consequences that will come from that.\u201d\nCocking is on the town council and has sought to pass motions to declare a climate emergency. But the mayor, Damien Ryan, is reluctant to sound the climate alarm.\n\u201cIn local government speak, when you have an emergency, you close it down,\u201d Ryan says.\n\u201cI have not had any of the people who talk about an emergency say what is the next step. So you declare an emergency, what do you do then the next day? That\u2019s never been made clear to me.\u201d\nAt its October meeting, the council did not agree on the word \u201cemergency\u201d but voted unanimously to say there was an \u201cescalating urgency for climate action\u201d.\nDouglas and the CLC say Aboriginal communities are doing what they can.\n\u201cPeople are already mitigating climate change through traditional burning and they are investing their income from land use agreements to install solar power, plant bush tucker gardens in communities and operate swimming pools, but all that counts for little in the face of the lack of climate leadership from the government,\u201d she says.\nThe NT government says it has allocated $15m to \u201crevitalising\u201d the Alice Springs city centre. Some of those funds will go towards shade and landscaping to help cool the streets, and to public water stations. Ryan says the council is encouraging local schools to plant more trees.\nThe Territory government says it has a climate change response strategy and is working with other governments and the Bureau of Meteorology to \u201cdevelop national guidelines for the development of a warning system for extreme heat events\u201d.\nIn the meantime, Douglas says, people are living in houses that are \u201cunbearable\u201d.\n\u201cDuring our summers you can sometimes see people in communities hosing the outside of their Besser brick walls with garden hoses to keep cool despite the water shortages \u2013 that\u2019s how desperate they are.\u201d\nAbout 3ookm north-west of Alice Springs is Yuendumu, the largest remote community in central Australia. Its 900 or so residents are facing summer without a reliable supply of adequate drinking water.\nThe NT government has stopped building new housing because there isn\u2019t enough water in the dwindling aquifer to accommodate more people.\nYuendumu is not alone.\nThe Central Land Council\u2019s chief executive, Joe Martin-Jard, says that at every regional meeting, water security is top of the agenda.\n\u201cBetween Alice Springs and Mount Isa, there\u2019s probably only one major community with a decent water supply,\u201d Martin-Jard says. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting the rain we used to, to recharge the aquifers. So as water is drawn out of the aquifers it becomes more saline and less potable [drinkable].\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really horrible dilemma.\u201d\nThe NT\u2019s Power and Water Corporation, which is responsible for essential services in 72 remote communities and outstations, says most communities in the arid region are \u201cfaced with some level of water stress\u201d and emergency planning is under way, but there are \u201crarely any simple solutions\u201d.\n\u201cThe difficult reality is that many communities originally developed historically in locations where there was never any secure, reliable, high quality water resources in close proximity,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAs those communities have grown \u2026 and expectations of improved levels of service have appropriately increased, the challenges also continue to increase.\u201d\nPower and Water says more drilling programs are planned but \u201cfinding new water sources is very challenging and often these drilling programs have moderate prospects for success\u201d.\n\u201cWithout large or extended rainfall \u2026 the water security risks will progressively increase in some centres, with an increased likelihood that source supply capacity at some could fail.\u201d\nAt least 12 communities have reported poor quality drinking water. At Laramba, Willowra and Wilora, nitrates and uranium are at levels exceeding health guidelines. NT Power and Water says it is \u201cinvestigating alternative technology options\u201d. It has already installed treatment plants at Kintore, Ali Curung and Yuelamu to reduce high levels of nitrates, uranium and fluoride.\n Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/12/17-41001-FS_HEATWAVE.mp3 \nIn Alice Springs\u2019 18 town camps, where people from out bush often end up, houses are commonly built from Besser bricks \u2013 hollow concrete blocks which are cheap, but which trap the heat. There\u2019s a lack of tree cover or other kinds of shade. Houses bake in the sun and, while the majority have solar panels, they often have only an evaporative air conditioning unit, known locally as a \u201cswampy\u201d, to cool the house.\nA \u201cswampy\u201d uses a lot of water and can struggle on hot days, especially when there are a lot of people sharing a house, which is common in town camps with big families and fluctuating populations.\n\u201cAir conditioning is an essential item in the desert, not a luxury,\u201d the CLC\u2019s Josie Douglas says, \u201cbut it does not come standard.\u201d When remote community and town camp tenants are offered housing, there is \u201ca hole where the aircon unit should be and they are told to buy it themselves\u201d.\n\u201cMany can only afford to \u2018close the gap\u2019 with a piece of wood, or run expensive reverse-cycle aircon very sparingly,\u201d she says. \u201cSome places don\u2019t have enough water to use a cheaper swampy.\u201d\nHouses that don\u2019t cool down overnight create big health and social problems.\n\u201cPeople resort to sleeping outside, or cramming everybody into the coolest room of the house, with all the well-known consequences for the spread of diseases that whitefellas only know from medical textbooks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also common for people to sleep in shifts, with young people roaming the streets at night where they get into trouble, and sleeping during the day when they should be at school.\u201d\nThis is at odds with the NT government\u2019s view of the quality of town camp and remote community housing. A government spokesperson tells Guardian Australia that homes are designed with weather conditions and regional climate in mind, and they include external shading, natural ventilation and insulation.\n\u201cInvestment into housing in town camps has included the installation of louvres, sunscreens, verandas and insulation,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Department of Housing and Community Development has also upgraded some key community infrastructure including improved shading and the installation of fans.\u201d\nDouglas is calling on the government to \u201cstop building concrete hotboxes\u201d.\n\u201cMore than a decade ago, the government and the CLC were partners [in research] that came up with really solid recommendations about how to make desert houses more energy-efficient and communities more resilient.\n\u201cSome measures, such as making sure houses are built with the right orientation \u2026 and have passive cooling and a white roof, cost almost nothing. We would like to know how many of these expensive research findings have been implemented in our region.\u201d\nShirleen Campbell is a Warlpiri and Arrernte woman who grew up at Hoppy\u2019s Camp, or Lhenpe Artnwe. She told the Alice Springs climate rally in October that town campers were very worried about climate change.\n\u201cThis is our place,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it gets too hot, if we suffer through endless droughts or we spoil our water, then we don\u2019t have another place to go.\n\u201cWe want houses that are right for this place and right for our people. We want to invest in renewable energy, like solar.\u201d\nCampbell is a co-coordinator of the women\u2019s family safety group at Tangentyere council, which delivers services to and advocates on behalf of town camp residents.\n\u201cMost of all we want people to treat this place as a legacy to be handed down to our children and grandchildren. It is not a speculative commodity and it is not something to be sold or exported.\n\u201cWe have been here for a long time and want to look after this place for those that come after.\u201d\nThere are few public places in Alice Springs to cool off. The Yeperenye shopping centre has security guards at the doors and, according to Douglas and Campbell, Aboriginal people are regularly moved on.\nThe library is a popular, free cool space. There\u2019s a widescreen TV rigged up with headphones, showing movies. Westerns are popular, as are replays of AFL grand finals. The Saltbush room down the hall is a haven for older folk, while little mobs of kids hang out among the young adult stacks or cluster around the phone-charging station.\n\u201cWe found there\u2019s a gap in after-school care services from about 2.30 to 4.30, the hottest time of the day,\u201d says the head librarian, Clare Fisher. \u201cThe kids can come to the library, cool off, have fruit and sandwiches.\u201d\n\u201cLibraries are for connection and relaxation as well as knowledge. We make everyone welcome \u2013 but we explain how to use the library and how to behave as well. We very much believe in come and be who you are.\u201d\nIn January footage of dead and dying horses in a dry creek bed at Ltyentye Apurte, 80km south-east of Alice Springs, flashed around the world.\nThe Ltyentye Apurte rangers had the unenviable task of dragging more than 100 dead horses from the creek bed and disposing of their bodies.\nIn June the CLC conducted an emergency cull of more than 1,400 feral horses, donkeys, camels and cattle from a waterhole near Lajamanu. The animals were thirsty and dying, congregating around the last remaining springs and water sites.\nThe CLC has eradicated 6,279 feral animals in preparation for summer. Traditional owners don\u2019t usually support animal culls, the CLC says, but there were no alternatives, with so many animals dying or in poor condition.\nFeral animals damage community infrastructure and housing. Thirsty camels, for example, will attack air conditioning units because they smell water, and lay waste to water tanks, bores, fences, pipes and taps.\nIn town, Tangentyere council wants to measure exactly how well houses are functioning.\nTangentyere\u2019s social policy and research manager, Michael Klerk, is in discussions with the CSIRO to install temperature data loggers in people\u2019s houses, to build a case for improvements that are taken for granted elsewhere: solar power, insulation, better air conditioning, wide awnings, more shade.\n\u201cLast summer \u2013 which was a very hot summer, soon to be repeated \u2013 a lot of anecdotal feedback was that people\u2019s evaporative air conditioners weren\u2019t cooling the houses sufficiently,\u201d Klerk says.\n\u201cThis probably reflects the reality that evaporative air conditioners are not good at cooling houses when the external temperatures are in the mid-40s.\n\u201cYou might drop the temperature of a house to mid-30s, but that\u2019s not an optimal internal ambient temperature for comfort or for health.\u201d\nMost people living in town camps and remote communities, and some in suburban public housing, have pre-paid electricity meters.\nResidents are issued a power card, which they top up with their welfare payments or income. Once the credit is spent, they have to top it up again, or go without electricity. Klerk says that happened a lot in the last quarter of 2018.\nIn Alice Springs, 420 of 570 households with prepaid electricity meters had at least one self-disconnection, which lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. Of the 570 Alice Springs meters, 285 are in town camp dwellings.\nIn effect, more than half the town campers ran out of money to pay for electricity.\n\u201cWhen the power goes off, it is bad for our health, the food gets spoiled, we can\u2019t wash our clothes and we can\u2019t wash our kids,\u201d Shirleen Campbell told the rally.\n\u201cIn summer, when our houses are hot or when we don\u2019t have electricity, our people look for comfort in air-conditioned public places. We are not always welcome in these places and sometimes there are problems. We are thankful for places like the library and the pool.\u201d\nKlerk says low-income residents shouldn\u2019t have to go broke trying to keep their houses cool. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable that people\u2019s houses are making them sick, and something really needs to be done about it. It shouldn\u2019t all be passed on to the consumer.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the case of people having to spend more money to keep the houses at a temperature that delivers health outcomes, then we have to rethink the levels of income support that are available to people, particularly in these regions where it\u2019s so hot.\u201d\nPredictions by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress for the health impacts of heat are dire. In its submission to the NT government\u2019s climate change policy discussion paper, it outlined some of them: \u201cIncreased sickness and mortality due to heat stress, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, increased risk from infectious disease, poorer mental health and an increased potential for social conflict.\u201d\nThe Pintupi-Luritja artist Irene Nangala was among the first to return to her home country at Kintore in the western desert, near the border with Western Australia, in the early 1980s.\nUntil then, Pintupi people had been living a long way from home at the mission at Papunya, and they were homesick.\nNangala helped set up the Kintore school. It was a \u201cwindbreak school\u201d at first, she says: just a tarp to keep the sun and the rain water out.\n\u201cThen we got a few teachers. It was hard work. We\u2019ve got a proper good school now, proper shop. Nice clinic and aged care, child care.\u201d\nNangala says she doesn\u2019t have an air-conditioner. On hot days the family puts blankets on the windows. Other elders whose aircon units break down have to wait for a repairer to come from Alice Springs, more than 10 hours\u2019 drive away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hot in Kintore. We can\u2019t go and sit outside. We have to go at night to sit down with the families.\u201d\nNevertheless, Nangala says she does not want to leave.\n\u201cWe built up Kintore,\u2019 she says. \u201cPeople are really enjoying going back to their grandfather\u2019s land. That\u2019s the right thing to do. And it\u2019s good for them to go back, the old people, good for the heart and the spirit.\n\u201cWhen they went first, they cried, they missed that place for a long time.\u201d\nNangala says people don\u2019t want to come into town, where life might be worse.\n\u201cClimate change is true,\u201d Nangala says. \u201cThey [politicians] got the map and weather things, they should see the temperature what is happening around Australia, it\u2019s so hot.\u201d\nJimmy Cocking says: \u201cWe are walking blindly into the new climate reality. We\u2019ve moved beyond hope, and we can\u2019t be running on hope alone.\n\u201cThe only thing that is going to get us over the line is action. And the antidote to despair is action.\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of things that we need to be looking to change so that we aren\u2019t going to be putting people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-659": {"text": "How to find health funds that align with your values\nIf you have ever stopped to wonder what your service providers are really doing with your money, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows many of us are trying to make more conscious choices, thinking about our impact and what we want from life.\nMore and more, we\u2019re asking businesses such as our banks and super funds to better align with what we want, and to invest in things we can feel good about, that make a real and positive difference. We also want insurance that we can trust and a health fund that understands where we\u2019re at in life.\nThe start of the year is a great time to evaluate your health insurance, shop around and optimise your life. And if you find a better fit, making the switch is easy.\nHere\u2019s how to choose a health fund that\u2019s the perfect fit.\nProducts and the services covered by health funds can be vastly different, and what suits someone else may not be right for you. Life may have changed significantly since you joined your current fund years ago, or maybe you have just stayed with the same provider as your parents.\nEither way, before you switch, think about who you are and where you\u2019re at. Maybe you\u2019re considering having a baby, or about to start a new job. You might want a health fund that complements your active lifestyle, or one that supports a specific community.\nKnowing what you need is the first step to finding the right fund for you. Composite: Guardian Labs/Getty Images.\nNot all health funds have the same priorities. Health funds that are not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group are able to put members first. On average, Members Health funds keep narrower margins and invest more of your paid premiums back into benefits. For-profit funds, on the other hand, have to maximise profits for investors and shareholders.\nFunds that make up Members Health return a higher proportion of member premiums back in benefits \u2013 on average it\u2019s 91%. It\u2019s no surprise that this is reflected in high satisfaction and high trust levels from members, who are also more likely to stick around.\nThe health fund you choose can also have an impact on your community. Some Members Health funds are based in regional areas and support local charities, sporting clubs and health services. Or, they might be industry-based; for example, a fund that\u2019s tailored for teachers, police, military, doctors, bank employees, transport and energy employees, emergency services, nurses or others. All these factors might influence your choice.\nHealth funds that are run for people, not for profits, are designed to give back to members, which can mean a better overall experience for you. Look for options that will have a direct benefit:\n- Customer service: support that\u2019s available and genuinely wants to help\n- Quality products: policies tailored to your individual health needs and stage of life, offering a combination of good-value prices, coverage and benefits\n- General wellbeing and preventative health: such as offers on dental, optical, osteo, chiro, physio and remedial massage\n- Complementary coverage: other high-quality insurance products, such as travel insurance\n- Convenience: digital tools, fast claims processing, and a caring person to speak to when you need it most\n- Strong values: a fund that aligns with your life, and puts you first\nNo matter what insurer you decide to go with - big or small - all Australian health funds provide access to healthcare services across the entire country.\nMore information is available than ever before. If you\u2019re looking at an industry-specific health fund, ask colleagues for their experiences. Funds run for people, not profits, can deliver better value while being tailored to members\u2019 needs.\nWebsite aggregators can help you compare your options. For example, the Members Health site allows you to filter funds by relevant criteria so you can find and research funds from one place - including some you may never have heard of. Once you\u2019ve got a shortlist, it\u2019s worth contacting a fund directly to quiz it on what it offers and how it will give back to you.\nThere are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Composite: Guardian Labs/Getty Images.\nAs we move through the different stages of life, our health care needs change. It\u2019s only logical, then, for you to regularly review your health insurance to ensure you\u2019re adequately covered.\nThat said, switching funds every year is extra admin you don\u2019t need, so the best choice is the one that adapts to your life - whether you\u2019re adding or removing extras, adjusting coverage levels or transitioning children onto or off your policy.\nCertain fund benefits can be good for your wallet, too. Some health funds run their own dental and optical clinics, or have preferred provider arrangements in place. Some offer loyalty rewards programs, and some have increased claim limits for services such as dental, optical and physiotherapy.\nHaving so many options makes it easy to find a fund that wants what you want.\nWhen you work hard in your profession, you want companies that understand your unique needs, challenges and goals. Some health funds are run and owned by members from inside an industry or community, so they really get you.\nThere are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Maybe you or your family are in the emergency services or defence, or working as teachers or miners. Perhaps you\u2019re in transport or banking, or a health profession. You\u2019ll also find funds with great benefits and options that are run by members of regional communities. With 27 Members Health funds to choose from, there is bound to be a health fund out there to suit you.\nYou might opt for a health fund that\u2019s focused on corporate social responsibility, pays out higher than average benefits or is a proactive contributor to your community.\nHealth funds regularly update their products and services to provide better options for members, so it pays to shop around.\nDo a regular health cover check:\n- Review your policy\u2019s restrictions\n- Make sure you understand any exclusions, excesses and co-payments\n- Check that you\u2019re on the most suitable plan, getting good value for money and not paying too much\nBefore you spend another year with a fund that\u2019s not quite right, find a Members Health fund that\u2019s exactly what you need.", "label": 0}, "text-660": {"text": "Coronavirus has completely changed how UK politics works\nWhereas Harold Wilson is said to have claimed a week is a long time in politics, a day is an eternity in coronavirus.

Fear of contact with others, travelling on public transport or going into public spaces may increase, and some people will have physical symptoms, such as an increased heart rate or upset stomach.\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the crisis is generating stress, and has advised people to avoid watching, reading or listening to news that causes feelings of anxiety or distress.\nStephen Buckley, of the mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cWe know that the coronavirus and its impact are causing stress and worry for many people. If you already have a mental health problem, it\u2019s possible that the worries of coronavirus may be affecting how you\u2019re coping.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nQuarantine or self-isolation is likely to have a negative impact on mental wellbeing. A review of the psychological impact of quarantine published in the Lancet in February said: \u201cSeparation from loved ones, the loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can, on occasion, create dramatic effects. Suicide has been reported, substantial anger generated, and lawsuits brought following the imposition of quarantine in previous outbreaks.\n\u201cThe potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible psychological costs.\u201d\nAccording to Kathryn Kinmond, a psychotherapist in Staffordshire and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, uncertainty is a key driver of anxiety. \u201cCoronavirus gives rise to lots of uncertainty, and this has particular resonance with people who suffer from anxiety.\u201d Clients were \u201cinevitably\u201d raising concerns about the coronavirus in therapy sessions, she said.\nAshley Fulwood, of OCD UK, said the charity had received an increase in calls and emails from people with obsessive compulsive disorder who were developing a new fixation on the coronavirus.\nAround a quarter of people with OCD experience compulsive cleaning, such as handwashing over a fear of contamination, according to Fulwood.\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing for some of those people their OCD is intensifying, there is lots of avoidance going on and lots more washing than is recommended by the government \u2013 for some people their OCD is being triggered to the point where they\u2019re washing for 20 minutes or longer,\u201d he said.\nEmily Burke, an 18-year-old student in Hertfordshire, has had OCD for four years and said she was finding the extensive media coverage and social media posts difficult to deal with.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard on it and I don\u2019t wash my hands as much as I used to, so it\u2019s really triggering. It\u2019s not even like I can just turn off social media because it\u2019s everywhere, everyone is saying: \u2018Have you washed your hands?\u2019\u201d she said.\nPanic attacks may also be a response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to David Crepaz-Keay, of the Mental Health Foundation.\n\u201cOne of the things that leads to panic attacks is excessive worrying for unsubstantiated reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a relatively small number of people in this country affected by coronavirus \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t allow that anxiety to cause us more problems than it warrants at the moment.\u201d\nTom Kinniburgh, a 33-year-old game designer in London, started experiencing panic attacks after a number of fellow travellers began feeling ill on their return flight from a skiing trip in Val d\u2019Isere, near northern Italy.\n\u201cI started feeling a bit ill and then I\u2019d see news articles or reports about the virus spreading and self-isolation, and I\u2019d get this huge wave of fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like it made me have a cough, and then it sort of settled in my stomach and made my heart palpitate and essentially made me not be able to breathe.\u201d\nHe said he started to worry he had contracted the virus, but the symptoms quickly disappeared and after talking to a friend who is a doctor, he realised he was experiencing panic attacks.\n\u201cThey lasted up to 30 minutes, and they were really quite debilitating, with real shortness of breath, tingling and loss of eyesight in some regard.\u201d \nSarah, from Gateshead, who did not want her surname published, said she had increased her dosage of anti-anxiety medication.\n\u201cSome of the things that politicians say, and also then some of the reporting of it \u2026 can create that initial anxiety response,\u201d she said. \nRosie Weatherley of Mind said mental health services were making plans to provide continued treatment in the case of restrictions on movement and the closure of workplaces.\n\u201cA lot of people are reliant on interaction with therapists, but some of that can be done by phone or online. People with mental health issues need to ensure their medication supplies are sufficient for any periods of self-isolation,\u201d she said.\nMind\u2019s advice to people who have behavioural problems about hygiene includes avoiding repeatedly reading the same advice, asking other people not to keep reminding them to wash their hands, setting time limits on handwashing, and using breathing exercises.", "label": 0}, "text-662": {"text": "Weatherwatch: sulphur clouds make shipping a not so secret polluter\nThe type of fuel used by ships has a substantial effect on cloud formation. Exhausts from dirty heavy oils leave a telltale trail of such dense cloud that they can be tracked from space. While ship emissions contain many chemicals including black carbon, researchers have discovered that it is the sulphate aerosols formed from the sulphur in the oil that is responsible for the clouds that sometimes trail behind ships for hundreds of miles.\nThe tracking technology was developed because researchers are trying to discover what effect this pollution is having on climate change and rainfall but also it will help enforce new regulations to curb these emissions.\nAlready there are prohibitions on using these sulphur-laden fuels in the North Sea, Baltic, English Channel and North America because of the damaging air pollution that drifts on land. Where these regulations are enforced the clouds associated with ship exhausts disappear.\nFrom January 2020 new regulations to clean up the shipping trade apply worldwide but some unscrupulous companies are expected to try and ignore them and continue to use the cheaper and dirtier heavy fuel oils.

Within minutes, his supporters were framing the impeachment hearings as an unpatriotic attack on a leader keeping America safe.\nTrump celebrated the death of Baghdadi, noting he had \u201cdied after running into a dead end tunnel whimpering and crying and screaming\u201d. The Isis leader was a \u201cdog\u201d, a \u201cgutless animal\u201d, and the Isis militants who died alongside him were \u201closers\u201d and \u201cfrightened puppies\u201d.\nIt sounded like the dialogue of a triumphant chieftain in a made-for-TV warrior epic, and at one point Trump confirmed he had witnessed it almost as a piece of cinema, \u201cas though you were watching a movie. The technology alone is really great.\u201d\nWhile the prepared statement focused on the special forces who had carried out the raid, the president\u2019s impromptu remarks in answer to reporters\u2019 questions, reverted to the Trumpian norm, presenting it as a personal achievement.\n\u201cI kept saying where\u2019s Al-Baghdadi,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been looking for him for three years.\u201d Days earlier, Trump had denigrated his former defence secretary, James Mattis, for being \u201coverrated\u201d and \u201cnot tough enough\u201d, and boasted: \u201cI captured Isis. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\nThe personality cult that Trump is seeking to construct had already taken on an alarming tone. Over the weekend, his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, had denounced another former aide turned critic, John Kelly, as \u201ctotally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president\u201d.\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is thought to have been born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971. Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0(Isis).\nIn July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and\u00a0Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.\nHis declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services.\nBaghdadi had\u00a0been seen publicly\u00a0on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year. From 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head.\nHe had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years, and there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he\u00a0continued to resurface\u00a0in audio tapes and videos. He killed himself in October 2019, while under attack from US forces.\nMichael Safi\nIt was clear within minutes of announcing Baghdadi\u2019s death, that the delusional bubble around the president would now be even harder to puncture. In one particularly bizarre claim for someone known not to use a computer, the president said that Isis \u201cuse the internet better than almost anyone in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s obsession with his predecessor was also very much at the fore. He left little doubt that Barack Obama\u2019s success in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden was on his mind. Baghdadi was the greater scalp, he argued. \u201cOsama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cThis is a man who built a whole \u2026 country, a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.\u201d\nTrump also repeated a claim that he had somehow had a hand in Bin Laden\u2019s downfall by calling for him to be targeted before the 9/11 attacks, before he was generally perceived as a threat. It is a false claim. Trump mentions Bin Laden in passing in one of his books, does not call for him to be tracked down, and the al-Qaida leader was already widely seen as a substantial threat following several attacks on the US.\nWithin minutes a photograph was put online of Trump in the situation room, that recalled the famous picture of Obama and his top aides witnessing the final moments in the hunt for Bin Laden. The Trump version was more formal, more staged, and with the president much more clearly the central, focal point.\nWhen Bin Laden was killed in 2011, one of Obama\u2019s first calls was to George W Bush, who had launched the hunt for the al-Qaida leader. By contrast, Trump is seeking to erase the Obama legacy. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeatedly makes the false claim that it was the current administration that amassed a coalition to defeat Isis. That coalition was almost totally put together and made operational under Obama.\nIn anticipating how Trump is likely to spend this treasure trove of political capital, the order in which other parties were given credit is instructive. Russia was named first and repeatedly. Moscow had no part in the operation but after being informed through deconfliction channels that an operation in the Idlib area was imminent they did not try to shoot the US gunships down.\nTurkey was thanked several times too, and even the Syrian regime, for no more than being the sovereign power in the territory where the raid took place.\nThe commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Kobani, tweeted on Sunday morning that the hunt for Baghdadi had been a five-month US-SDF joint intelligence operation, but in Trump\u2019s remarks, the Kurds were mentioned last and somewhat grudgingly.\nTrump has abandoned the SDF and the Kurds in a deal with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, that has allowed Turkey, Russia and the Syrian regime to take over control of north-east Syria, and at the expense of the Kurds. If Mazloum\u2019s claim of the SDF role in the Baghdadi hunt is accurate, the scale of Trump\u2019s betrayal is all the greater.\nIn his remarks on Sunday, Trump said Turkey \u201chas taken tremendous deaths \u2026 they\u2019ve lost thousands and thousands of people from that safe zone\u201d referring to the border area that was under SDF control. The claim is untrue, but it echoes Ankara\u2019s talking points, equating the SDF with the PKK Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey, and arguing the invasion was an urgent necessity for Turkish security.\nIf there was any doubt before this week, Trump made even clearer that his sole preoccupation in Syria was with the oil reserves in the east.\n\u201cThe oil is so valuable,\u201d he said. US forces, who have already begun streaming back into Syria heading for the oil fields around Deir Ezzor, would help to keep them out of the hands of Isis. Secondly, oil revenues would help the Kurds.\n\u201cAnd number three, it can help us because we should be able to take some also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd what I intend to do perhaps is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly.\u201d\nBaghdadi\u2019s killing will help underline the simple foreign policy message that Trump is crafting for his re-election campaign. He alone inflicted a decisive defeat on Isis. Having achieved that, US troops will be withdrawn except when it is direct US economic interests to stay. Trump\u2019s cooperation with Russian and Turkish leaders had brought about this great success. And lastly, and most importantly, the Democrats, like the intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, are seeking to undermine these achievements with their politically motivated pursuit of impeachment.\nOne of the president\u2019s Fox News surrogates, Jeanine Pirro, gave an early taste of White House messaging. \u201cJudge Jeanine\u201d tweeted: \u201cSo proud of @realDonaldTrump taking out abu bakr al bagdadi. Maybe the intelligence committee under @Adam schiff should start focusing on America\u2019s enemies and not their selfish political agenda.\u201d\nA lot can still go wrong for Trump. A desire for revenge could trigger an Isis resurgence, aided by the chaos caused by the Turkish offensive. Escaped Isis detainees could be involved in attacks. Conflicts with Iran and North Korea could sour the Trump pitch of having saved America from global conflicts.\nBut there is no doubt that a damaged, embattled Trump, who was losing the confidence of even staunch politically allies, is now greatly strengthened.", "label": 0}, "text-664": {"text": "UK poll finds young people's mental health hit by coronavirus\nMore than 80% of young people with a history of mental ill health have found their conditions have worsened since the coronavirus crisis began in the UK, a survey has found.\nIn a study by the mental health charity YoungMinds, 2,111 people aged under 25, who had a history of mental health needs, were asked how the pandemic had affected them. \nOf the 83% who said the pandemic had made their mental health worse, 32% said it had made it \u201cmuch worse\u201d and 51% said it had made it \u201ca bit worse\u201d.\nThe survey was carried out during a period of immense change, between 20 March, when UK schools were closed to most students, and 25 March, when further restrictive measures had been put in place.\nAmong the respondents who were accessing mental health support leading up to the crisis \u2013 including from the NHS, school and university counsellors, charities, helplines and private providers \u2013 74% said they were still receiving support and 26% said they were unable to access support.\nAmong those who could no longer access support, some said they had been affected due to the closure of schools, not being able to attend peer support groups or because face-to-face services could not be done online or over the phone. Others had been offered remote support but were concerned about privacy, access to technology or felt anxious about speaking on the phone or via video calls.\nWhen the charity asked respondents what had impacted their mental health the most, the loss of routine and social isolation were the most commonly cited factors.\nEmma Thomas, the chief executive of YoungMinds, said the pandemic was a \u201chuman tragedy that will continue to alter the lives of everyone in our society.

But the slow travel movement \u2013 a seismic shift in the mindset of once-frenetic holidaymakers \u2013 is one trend that seems set to stay. Casting aside the need for Instagram likes and bucket list ticks, slow travel shows there\u2019s more to holidaying than whistle-stop city tours and frantic red-eye flights. Instead, we want to take our time over things: the slow swoosh of a sun-drenched French boat trip; a peaceful cycle through the tulip fields of Holland; a rocky amble around the Irish coast. Recently, the movement has been strengthened even further, as the Swedish concept of flygskam, or \u201cflight shame\u201d \u2013 which encourages people to boycott air travel in order to lower carbon emissions \u2013 takes hold. Now, how we travel is almost more important than where we travel, which makes getting about by ferry one of the wisest travel choices you can make. Here are a few more reasons to take to the seas.\nIt allows you to connect with your passionsThe allure of travelling at your own pace is that you can explore a country under your own steam, be that on two feet or two wheels. If you\u2019re an avid cyclist, taking the ferry means you can bring your beloved metal steed along with you to any destination at no extra cost (bike-friendly Holland should do the trick). And there\u2019s no stingy baggage allowance or cramped overhead lockers to contend with, so you can bring all the energy bars and extra pairs of lycra you wish.\nYour holiday starts onboardRather than being confined to a few (small, uncomfortable) inches of a plane seat, there\u2019s plenty to explore on the ferry. Kick back in the lounge with a newspaper, hot drink, comfortable seating and panoramic views of seabirds coasting over the ocean waves. Meanwhile, brasseries, food courts and bars offer more than enough options to settle grumbling bellies. You\u2019ll find just as much freedom when you arrive at your destination, and as soon as your feet touch new soil you\u2019ll be ready for your adventure, whether that\u2019s exploring higgledy-piggledy French flea markets or cycling around Northern Ireland\u2019s magnificent Causeway Coast \u2013 with no heinous jet lag.\nThere\u2019s no airport stressRare is the person who can pass through an airport unscathed by the stress of monstrous check-in queues, frustrating security processes and baggage handlers who treat moving suitcases like an Olympic discus event. Travelling by ferry offers a more laid-back approach, with streamlined boarding processes and no-fuss logistics. Best of all? There are no pesky \u201csurprise\u201d buses waiting to take you and a hundred other angry passengers to the correct terminal either.\nThe fun\u2019s in the journeyThink of slow travel as exploring the places \u201cin between\u201d A and B. By taking things slowly and savouring the journey, we become part of a place for a short time, rather than just lurching frantically through it. The deck of a ferry, the bunk of a cabin, or a window with expansive sea views becomes your new viewpoint, and you can immerse yourself in landscapes \u2013 from tiny islands to craggy coastlines \u2013 that you would never see from 35,000ft up, giving you a new appreciation of the part of the world that you\u2019re travelling through.\nIt broadens your horizonsPerhaps you\u2019ve always stuck to the UK for your annual camping trip \u2013 liking the familiarity of that bluebell wood you know so well, or the campsite you love so much. Travelling by ferry allows you to push your boundaries a bit further and explore destinations you might never have previously considered. Why not swap the forests of England for the seaside campsites of Belgium? Or pay a visit to the historic battlefields of Ypres? Because really, exploring the unfamiliar is what adventure is all about.\nIt\u2019s ready-made mindfulnessNot all of us have time for meditation and paddleboard yoga, but there is something wonderfully calming about just slowing down. Getting anywhere by ship \u2013 where brains are lulled by the slow chug of the engine and frazzled nerves are calmed by the sound of the ocean \u2013 is about as close to mindfulness as you can get while not wearing a fluffy robe. And if a sand-splattered dog walk on a sprawling beach sounds like your kind of mindfulness, pets (including cats and ferrets) are welcome on board many P&O Ferries routes too.

As the lockdown has rolled on, music events have fallen like dominoes \u2013 Glastonbury, Primavera, All Points East among them \u2013 the months to come now marked by an absence of revelry and also something of an economic void. Last year, more than a quarter of UK adults attended a festival, and the combined concert and festival industry was valued at more than \u00a32.6bn.\nTouring musicians have proved remarkably enterprising during quarantine, streaming home performances, guitar tutorials and DJ sets, and launching various charity fundraising initiatives. But as the novelty wanes and a new normality settles, a question arises: is there a way that a real-life music festival can be replicated in the virtual world?\nIn Totnes, Devon, Sea Change festival was launched five years ago by the owners of the town\u2019s much-loved Drift record shop. It has been propelled by goodwill and great taste, consistently drawing an impressive and diverse line-up (this year promising Aldous Harding, Squid and Shirley Collins over three days in May) and making great use of its location (events sprawling across the town\u2019s civic hall, church, cinema, pubs, industrial units, and, more recently, the Dartington Hall estate).\nThe decision not to postpone or cancel but instead reincarnate the festival online, sooner and for free, was bold but also canny, and perhaps indicative of the loyalty that has quickly grown between Sea Change and its audience.\nOn Friday afternoon, the lineup was still a work in progress: even at that late hour artists were being added to the weekend\u2019s bill, and there was the surprise announcement that Jon Savage was \u201cgoing early\u201d with a 4pm Twitter discussion of his new book, an oral history of Joy Division. Over the following two days there would be contributions from the Cool Greenhouse, the Orielles, a Gene Clark documentary and David Keenan\u2019s tarot readings.\nSaturday evening belonged to the record label Erased Tapes, with an impeccably chosen taster menu of its roster, including a split-screen performance by the exquisitely voiced Douglas Dare and Manu Delgado, and the Pakistani-American composer Qasim Naqvi performing a modular synth set from his kitchen in New York. Sunday brought Tim\u2019s Twitter Listening Party, in which the Charlatans\u2019 Tim Burgess explored seminal albums with the musicians who made them \u2013 everything from Gwenno\u2019s Le Kov to the Breeders\u2019 Last Splash.\nMany of the sets proved brief affairs, reflective perhaps of our short online attention spans but also echoing the festivalgoer\u2019s tendency to meander from stage to stage, catch a song or two here, the tail-end of a reading there \u2013 Billy Bragg performing a timely rendition of No One Knows Nothing Anymore, followed by the poet Will Burns reading from his new collection Country Music. Some events were broadcast simultaneously but kept online so one could return, or hop between the two.\nIt took a moment to adjust and to realise that one does not need to remain glued to one\u2019s laptop but could instead enjoy Max Porter and Bonnie Prince Billy\u2019s It\u2019s Going to Be a Bright New Day, or the Hot Singles Club DJ set while doing a spot of yoga, taking a stroll or fixing a stiff gin and tonic.\nThe key to the weekend\u2019s success was that by moving across platforms \u2014 from video streaming to Soundcloud, Twitter to Spotify to Instagram live \u2013 and providing links to explore works further (or purchase online), it managed to create both texture and a sense of companionability. Not once did it feel a flat or lonely endeavour; rather it found a great swell of congregation.\nThis is not a format that will work for every festival, but for an event like Sea Change, marked in real life by its intimacy and warmth, it proved a triumph: glimpses of a festival that might have been, certainly, but also its own entity, particular to the strange new nowhere in which we now find ourselves. As the official festival poster states: \u201cI went to Sea Change 2020.

It sets out a strategy for reshaping the present fragmented NHS systems that require women to see different nurses and doctors in a variety of specialised clinics, as well as their GP practice, for procedures that should be routine.\nA survey of 3,000 women shows that large numbers find it hard to get advice and care near home. More than a third (37%) said they could not get contraception services locally and 60% could not easily access unplanned pregnancy services, including abortion care.\nThe all-time high level of abortions is connected to the unmet contraceptive needs of women, says the report. In 2018, there were 200,608 abortions across England and Wales \u2013 an increase of 4% on the previous year.\nOver a third (34%) of women did not attend their last cervical cancer smear test, the survey shows. Only half had locally available sexually transmitted infection services, 56% struggled to get help for painful periods and 58% could not get menopause services locally.\nIt\u2019s not just special pleading for women, said Lesley Regan, president of the college. Many are carers and mothers and they influence the healthcare behaviours of everyone else. \u201cIf you get it right for women, you get it right for lots of other people,\u201d she said.\nMany of the services women need are preventive, such as cancer screening and contraception. Many are paid for from the public health budget, through local authorities, and have been cut because of the 40% reduction in that budget, said Regan.\n\u201cWomen are falling through the cracks of very basic services that should be very easy to prevent or access,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not rocket science. We are not suggesting an expensive new solution. We\u2019re just saying we need to think about women across their life course because so many of the things that affect women, for which they need the NHS, are predictable.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not delivering what women need where they need it,\u201d she said. A smear test, contraception and an STI check could all be done by the same person in 15 minutes, she said. \u201cBut at the moment, girls and women are being pushed around from pillar to post because a nurse or the health practitioner or the GP that they visit hasn\u2019t got the commission to actually do the other things as well.\u201d\nSome 45% of pregnancies are now unplanned, she said. \u201cWhat we do know is that when they\u2019re not planned, they have much more complex outcomes often, and that means they are more expensive to deliver, and we see the abortion rate is not going up in girls \u2013 the teenage-pregnancy strategy has worked very well \u2013 it\u2019s in the 40-year-olds who can\u2019t access contraception.\u201d\nWomen should not have to go back to the GP for a new prescription for the pill every three months when it has been heavily researched for the last 60 years. \u201cIt\u2019s far more dangerous to get pregnant than it is to be on the pill,\u201d she said. Girls and women should be able to get the very safe progestogen-only pill from a pharmacist or online, the report says. The morning-after pill should be sold straight off the shelf without the need to speak to a doctor or pharmacist.\nThe report says all young people should be educated from an early age about women\u2019s health, and health issues such as the support during menopause should be embedded in workplace policies.\nThe college says the changes would save money by enabling women to stay in better health. Sexual health experts from the faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) voiced support.\nGill Walton, chief executive of the RCM, backed its findings, including those on abortion, which she said should be regarded as just another medical procedure. \u201cThis is an important report that puts women at the centre of health improvement that needs governments and those running our health services to take notice. Our whole health service needs to focus much more on prevention of ill health, and to invest in our health and social services to support that,\u201d she said.\n", "label": 0}, "text-669": {"text": "April is the start of the tax year. How will the changes affect me?\nTraditionally, the beginning of a new tax year brings changes to taxes, benefits and the cost of some essentials \u2013 and despite the extraordinary conditions we are currently living in, this year is no different.\nFrom 6 April we will see changes to junior Isas, national insurance and inheritance tax (IHT), among many adjustments that will affect the pounds in your pocket. There were also a number of price changes that came into effect on Wednesday 1 April, dubbed by some as \u201cnational price hike day\u201d.\nHere\u2019s what is changing:\nNational living wage \u2013 up 6.2%\nThe national living wage for workers aged 25 and over increased by 6.2% to \u00a38.72 an hour from 1 April. Workers aged 21 to 24 saw their hourly rate increase from \u00a37.70 to \u00a38.20, while those aged 18 to 20 saw a rise of 30p to \u00a36.45 an hour.\nFor people aged 18 and under, their hourly rate went up by 20p to \u00a34.55. The minimum wage for apprentices also increased, from \u00a33.90 to \u00a34.15.\nNew two-week parental bereavement leave\nFrom 6 April, parents who suffer the loss of a child under the age of 18, or suffer a stillbirth from 24 weeks of pregnancy, will be entitled to two weeks\u2019 statutory paid leave. The new entitlement is known as Jack\u2019s Law, in memory of 23-month-old Jack Herd, who drowned in a pond in 2010. \nNational Insurance \u2013 save \u00a3104\nThe threshold for national insurance contributions is increasing from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 from 6 April.\nThe new threshold means the average full-time worker will see their tax bill cut by \u00a3104 a year, and the typical self-employed worker by \u00a378.\nPrescriptions \u2013 up by 15p\nStarting on 1 April, the price of a prescription went up by 15p, from \u00a39 to \u00a39.15, in line with inflation.\nThe cost of a prepayment certificate (PPC) \u2013 which lets you get as many NHS prescriptions as you need for a set price \u2013 also increased. A three-month PPC increased by 55p to \u00a329.65 and a 12-month PPC went from \u00a3104 to \u00a3105.90.\nTV licence \u2013 up \u00a33\nThe price of watching the BBC through buying a TV licence went up on 1 April from \u00a3154.50 to \u00a3157.50, a \u00a33 increase, or 2%.\nCouncil tax \u2013 up 3.9%\nThe average council tax for a band D property will be \u00a31,817, up 3.9%.\nJunior Isas \u2013 allowance doubled\nThere was good news for parents in the budget \u2013 the maximum amount they can save in a junior Isa for their child is increasing from \u00a34,368 to \u00a39,000 a year from 6 April. As with all types of Isa, there is no tax to pay on interest or capital gains on growth. \nState pension \u2013 up 3.9%\nThe state pension will go up by 3.9% in April, the biggest rise since 2012. This means those receiving the new state pension (who reached pension age after 6 April 2016) will see an increase of \u00a36.60 a week to \u00a3175.20.\nThose claiming the old state pension will see their basic payment increase by \u00a35.05 a week to \u00a3134.25.\nPension savings \u2013 good news for doctors\nHigh earners can save even more in their pensions from 6 April as the lifetime allowance (the maximum you can save into a pension before high tax charges apply) will rise from \u00a31,055,000 to \u00a31,073,000.\nThere is also good news for high earners hit by the pensions \u201ctaper tax\u201d that resulted in top NHS doctors receiving large tax bills.\nThe standard tax-free annual allowance on pension contributions is \u00a340,000 but this starts to taper down to \u00a310,000 for those earning more than \u00a3110,000. This allowance goes up to \u00a3200,000 from 6 April but the minimum floor will fall from \u00a310,000 to \u00a34,000.\nStudent loan repayment threshold \u2013 up \u00a3850\nGraduates will get a small boost in their take-home pay from April as the amount they can earn before starting to repay their student loan will increase from \u00a325,725 to \u00a326,575.\nThose who earn over this limit repay the loan at a rate of 9% above this figure, so the increase will mean graduates earning above the threshold will keep an extra \u00a376.50 of their pay.\nInheritance tax \u2013 homes up to \u00a31m can avoid tax\nThe nil-rate IHT band for anyone passing the family home to their direct descendants increases to \u00a3500,000 from 6 April.\nThe family home allowance has increased each year since its introduction in 2017. In the 2020-21 tax year the final increase will be up to \u00a3175,000. Combined with the standard threshold of \u00a3325,000, it means many families will not pay IHT on estates worth less than \u00a3500,000, while couples will be able to leave estates worth up to \u00a31m before IHT kicks in.\nBuy-to-let\nMortgage tax relief for buy-to-let landlords has been gradually phased out since 2017. The new tax year marks the final phase of its removal \u2013 this will affect higher and additional rate tax payers.\nLandlords can no longer deduct mortgage expenses from their rental income to reduce the tax they pay. Instead, they will receive a tax-credit, based on 20% of their mortgage interest payments. Landlords selling up will also be affected by new capital gains tax (CGT) rules, which come into effect in April.", "label": 0}, "text-670": {"text": "Boris Johnson refuses to grant Scotland powers to hold independence vote\nBoris Johnson has written to Nicola Sturgeon to formally reject her request for the transfer of powers necessary to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence.\nScotland\u2019s first minister immediately dismissed the prime minister\u2019s position as \u201cunsustainable and self-defeating\u201d, insisting: \u201cThe Westminster union cannot be sustained without consent.

It asked: \u201cShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u201d The result \u2013 the majority vote to leave \u2013 was clear but close. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has now begun to implement it and would like to pretend that the issue is done and dusted.\nThis is patently not the case. For one thing, most of the terms on which Brexit Britain will coexist alongside the EU remain to be decided. For another, it was common ground among leavers and remainers that a lot of umbilically linked questions clustered around the core EU argument. Among them were such things as austerity, business confidence, inequality, regional decline, hostility to London, nationalist narratives, resentment of elites \u2013 and immigration. Ever since 2016, these other Brexit-powered questions have helped to reshape British politics at least as much as Brexit itself has done.\nThe principal surrogate takeaway from the leave vote in the Conservative party has been immigration controls. Theresa May was a remainer. But she became Tory party leader in part because, as the former home secretary, she was identified with the strict immigration policy that leave voters were judged to be demanding in the referendum. May repeatedly made it clear that she saw border controls and curbs on migrant numbers as synonymous with the leave mandate. That baton has now passed to Johnson, whose post-Brexit immigration plans were published on Wednesday.\nThe Tory party has become a nationalist party, sustained by the tabloid press, rather than a class party\nIn this respect, Johnson is carrying on where May left off. He sees his immigration plan as second only to EU withdrawal itself in establishing the foundations of the post-Brexit Britain over which he wishes to preside. That\u2019s partly why the policy has been announced while parliament is in recess. Headlines like the Mail\u2019s \u201cImmigration Revolution: Boris\u2019s Border Blueprint\u201d on Wednesday have had a perfect launch.\nBut it is important to be clear why Johnson, like May before him, thinks this way. It\u2019s because, in the final analysis, the driving force behind this week\u2019s new curbs is primarily political, not economic. It is as much about driving a wedge into the opposition parties as it is about achieving specific migration goals. It thus underscores a crucial change in the Tory party to which its rivals may not have yet adjusted.\nBritain\u2019s immigration debate has always been about both control and the appearance of control. In political terms, it is the appearance that counts most. That has been true ever since the 1960s, when the mantra of \u201cfirm but fair\u201d immigration control as the precondition for domestic racial harmony and equality first took root. Johnson\u2019s proposals this week, fleshing out the so-called points-based immigration system proposed in the party\u2019s election manifesto, sit broadly within that tradition.\nNevertheless, the immigration issues that Britain faces in the 2020s are different in kind from those it faced in the 1960s. That is because the EU and EEA freedom of movement rights, which went with Britain\u2019s 43 years of EU membership, are due to cease on 31 December. The large rise in EU freedom of movement after 2004 did more than anything else to drive up migrant numbers in the years before the referendum, even though it was the refugee crisis in Syria and north Africa that made the issue truly toxic in 2016.\nJohnson\u2019s plan is a political initiative masquerading as an economic one. Britain\u2019s departure from the EU and its rejection of EU freedom of movement mean that new immigration rules are needed. But the governing approach in the new plan is to impress the voting public rather than to solve labour market issues that face businesses and domestic or overseas workers. The practical side takes second place to the message. Home secretary Priti Patel talked on Wednesday as though the new system would at last enfranchise 8 million UK workers to get the jobs that foreigners had been filling until now. This is total nonsense. The economically inactive are overwhelmingly students, retired or long-term sick. But it\u2019s the immigration revolution headlines that matter.\nThe details of the Johnson-Patel package matter more to businesses than they do to ministers or the public. Sectors such as construction, where 14% of the existing labour force is said to be non-UK (the figure is 54% in London) face a real hit unless the boundary between skilled (good) and unskilled (bad) migrants is better managed than the government plan implies. The knock-on effect for Johnson\u2019s ambitious infrastructure projects and hospital building pledges would be pretty dire if this does not happen. The hospitality industry will similarly be on an economic knife-edge, with destructive implications for the already struggling high street. There are likely to be many tweaks to this evolving plan once the news spotlight has moved elsewhere.\nThat is because these details pale into relative insignificance for the government when compared with the political dividends the Tories expect from the parade of tough action. Even though net migration has increased a lot in the past 20 years, public opinion routinely exaggerates its scale. It is likely to go on doing so as long as the Mail is around. The post-2016 fall in EU migration to the UK has made little difference. The polls consistently show that a majority (albeit a slowly declining one) want immigration cut. Everything Patel ever says shows that, however little she understands or cares about the detailed impact of this week\u2019s plan, she absolutely gets that this is intended to be another \u201cjob done\u201d moment for the government, just like Brexit itself.\nThe Johnson government\u2019s approach to immigration is of a piece with its general approach to Brexit. The idea that the interests of business are the government\u2019s priority, or that the modern Tory party can any longer be seen as the party of business, is largely for the birds. That internal battle was fought and lost in the Brexit battles of the last parliament. The Tory party has become a nationalist party, sustained by the tabloid press, rather than a class party sustained by traditional business interests.\nThe Tory party has also discovered, without necessarily intending to, something that centre-right parties and movements have simultaneously discovered in other parts of the world. Arguments based on national identity are proving to be tailor-made for splitting the social democratic constituencies that used to maintain parties like Labour. Social democracy\u2019s working-class voters quite like the appeal to nationhood. Its middle-class voters, on the other hand, greatly dislike it. Putting these constituencies back together gets ever more difficult.\nIn Britain, Labour does not know how to respond on immigration \u2013 and Johnson knows it. One Labour response is to criticise his immigration plans for the problems they cause for business. Johnson does not care about that. He got where he is today by saying \u201cfuck business\u201d. Another response is to accuse him of racism. Johnson sees no threat there either. He reckons he will be laughing all the way to the ballot box as long as middle-class politicians accuse him \u2013 and his voters \u2013 of such things. His immigration plans may or may not work on the ground, in the high street or at the borders, but in the end that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s not the economy, stupid. It\u2019s the politics.\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist", "label": 0}, "text-674": {"text": "Euro 2020 becomes biggest sporting event postponed due to coronavirus\nIt was billed as a glorious festival of football across 12 European cities, from Bilbao to Baku, with a final played at Wembley Stadium in July. But on Tuesday the Euro 2020 football championship became the biggest major sporting event to be postponed because of the coronavirus crisis, reset for 12 months later.\nThe decision was confirmed after European football\u2019s governing body, Uefa, held a teleconference with the leagues, clubs and players\u2019 union. Uefa\u2019s hope is that postponing the tournament will free up space in the football calendar for the backlog of previously postponed domestic matches to be played in the summer. However, that will depend on the Covid-19 pandemic being subdued.\nUefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: \u201cWe are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent. It is at times like these, that the football community needs to show responsibility, unity, solidarity and altruism.\n\u201cPurpose over profit has been our guiding principle in taking this decision for the good of European football as a whole. The thought of celebrating a pan-European festival of football in empty stadia, with deserted fan zones while the continent sits at home in isolation, is a joyless one and one we could not accept to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the competition.\u201d\nTwenty of the 24 teams due to play in Euro 2020 have qualified, including England and Wales, but play-offs set for this month to determine the remaining four places have been postponed. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland each have a chance of joining the giants of European football, including France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, in the tournament.\nUefa moved the tournament dates from 12 June-12 July 2020 to 11 June-11 July 2021, although a number of issues remain outstanding, including whether the tournament competition will still be played in 12 venues across the continent, and what will happen to next year\u2019s Club World Cup and women\u2019s Euro 2021 competitions. Uefa said later the women\u2019s tournament, planned to begin on 7 July 2021, would be rescheduled for an unspecified date.\nThere also remains uncertainty about where and when this year\u2019s Champions League final will be held, with the tournament still yet to complete its last-16 stage, and whether the European leagues will be able to finish their domestic seasons. However Gianni Infantino, the president of the sport\u2019s global governing body, Fifa, said he hoped appropriate solutions would be found by the end of April.\nInfantino also revealed that Fifa\u2019s council would discuss a $10m donation to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Covid-19 solidarity response fund, as well as setting up a separate global football assistance fund to help members of the football community affected by this crisis. The most significant sporting event of the year, the Olympics in Tokyo, is still on track, with the International Olympic Committee again insisting it was still \u201cfully committed\u201d to staging the event this summer, and that constant speculation was counterproductive.\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented situation for the whole world, and our thoughts are with all those affected by this crisis,\u201d the IOC said in a statement following a meeting of its executive board. \u201cWe are in solidarity with the whole of society to do everything to contain the virus. The situation around the Covid-19 virus is also impacting the preparations for Tokyo 2020, and is changing day by day.\n\u201cThe IOC remains fully committed to Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage; and any speculation at this moment would be counter-productive.\u201d\nThe opening events of the elite Diamond League athletics season \u2013 in Qatar and China \u2013 were moved to the autumn, while all organised grassroots athletics in the UK has been suspended until the end of April. A UK Athletics statement said that all \u201cface-to-face organised athletics activity\u201d, including races, leagues, running groups and training meetings, was now banned.\n\u201cMonday\u2019s announcements from the prime minister made it explicitly clear that non-essential travel and non-essential social gatherings should be avoided whenever possible and the sport of athletics will adhere to these guidelines,\u201d it added. \u201cHowever world class programme athletes are still being supported to train in official training environments and venues undertaking necessary precautions.\u201d\nOn Tuesday evening the UK Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said the spread of Covid-19 meant there would be a \u201csignificant reduction in our testing programme\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a difficult decision and one that has not been taken lightly,\u201d she said. \u201cOur priority is the health and welfare of athletes, and our own staff and doping control officers. Our ongoing responsibility remains to protect clean sport, but we must give precedence to health and welfare and act responsibly in line with government advice during this unprecedented time.\u201d\nThe French Open tennis was postponed from May until September, and the British Horseracing Authority suspended all racing in Britain until the end of April to protect essential emergency services and the health and welfare of staff working in the racing industry.\n\u201cThis is a national emergency the likes of which most of us have never seen before,\u201d said Nick Rust, the BHA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere will be difficult months ahead for many of us.

The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute,\u00a0calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\"\nOne aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.\u00a0\nAnother aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\u201cChevron is taking action to address climate change by investing in technology and low-carbon business opportunities that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to produce affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy to support social and economic progress.

The company has also put forward the low-carbon development objective, targeting to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of industrial value-added by 25%, compared with 2015, by 2020. By 2030, we will continue to increase the supply of natural gas and other clean energy, make sure that domestic natural gas production accounts for 55% of the company\u2019s domestic primary energy, in order to effectively control the emission of greenhouse gases.\u201d\n\u201cTotal is fully aware of the challenges represented by climate change, has acknowledged the link between greenhouse gases and climate change publicly for several decades and has never engaged in \u2018misinformation campaigns\u2019. We would be grateful if you would therefore refrain from alleging that Total engaged in misinformation campaigns as this is an entirely unsubstantiated allegation. On the contrary, and for many years now, Total has integrated climate change concerns into the development of its strategy.\n\u201cIndeed, our challenge is to increase access to affordable energy to satisfy the needs of a growing population, while providing concrete solutions that will help limit the effects of climate change and supply an energy mix that progressively decreases in carbon intensity.\n\u201cAs far as the Climate Accountability Institute\u2019s study you refer to is concerned, a distinction must be made between emissions resulting directly from our activities and those which arise from the use of the products which we make available to our customers and which we do not control.

And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan for? Carina Nicu, 27, research technician at the University of Manchester\nHi Carina, you\u2019re right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament.\nLabour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it\u2019s costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). It would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits \u2013 though of course it wouldn\u2019t just be these students who would benefit.\nLabour hasn\u2019t earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure, but its biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested. Labour says it\u2019s just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won\u2019t be high by international standards. Critics say it will deter foreign investment and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders.\nI have teenage grandchildren, one hoping to start higher education next year. Please can you clarify the Labour position on student grants \u2013 both for maintenance and tuition fees. Will there be means testing? If Labour forms a government after the election when would any new arrangements for student finances be introduced? Muriel, Preston\nHello Muriel, Labour has said it will abolish tuition fees for all students \u2013 beginning immediately, so for those starting university in autumn 2020 \u2013 and bring back maintenance grants for the children of families on lower incomes.\nAre there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? Sabrina\nHi Sabrina, yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party\u2019s longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here.\nAnd it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \u201cdeclaratory system\u201d, under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn\u2019t be a requirement for continuing to live and work here. (The manifesto doesn\u2019t say how that would work for employers wondering if a particular individual has the right to be here.) Labour would also expand the right of all migrants to bring their families to the UK.\nAs for freedom of movement, that would depend on what happens with Brexit.\nLabour has often hinted at electoral reform. Is there any commitment to scrapping the first past the post system for general elections? Daniel, 46, geologist, Leamington Spa\nI\u2019m afraid, not, Daniel. Labour\u2019s manifesto says it will \u201ctake urgent steps to refresh our democracy\u201d, and it commits to a series of specific changes including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16, but there is no mention of voting reform.\nIt does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens\u2019 assembly. It appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK, but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation? That\u2019s as close as the manifesto comes on the issue.\nWhat does the nationalisation of Openreach mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach\u2019s competitors? There seems to have been no mention of this, with the implication being that given there will be no need for competitors of British Broadband, that their job losses will be the price to pay for \u201cfree\u201d broadband. Sam, West Midlands\nGood question Sam. My colleague Peter Walker actually asked about the fate of those companies at the launch event for the broadband policy. The answer he was given was that they could continue to provide add-on services, such as subscription TV packages. But you\u2019re right, the expectation would be that their broadband operations would wither away (while BT Openreach \u2013 renamed British Broadband \u2013 would expand its operations significantly, presumably).\nJust how radical is the Labour party manifesto \u2013 when compared to both traditional British politics, and to other European countries? Tom Bacon, freelance journalist in the entertainment sector, Ormskirk\nHi Tom, Jeremy Corbyn was right when he told my colleague Kate Proctor this week that his plans wouldn\u2019t put the UK significantly out of line with other European countries in terms of tax and spending and the size of the state.\nBut it\u2019s the speed of the transformation that is so striking: the manifesto envisages a radical transformation of the economy and the role of government in just five years. As the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, put it, \u201cthis would be the biggest set of spending increases and the biggest set of tax increases and the biggest set of borrowing increases we\u2019ve seen in peacetime history.\u201d\nI\u2019m aware that Labour are planning to decriminalise abortion \u2013 which I am wholly supportive of. However, I\u2019m not clear on whether this also changes the law on the latest a woman can legally terminate? Many Tory supporters I know are posting pro-life website claims that abortion will be made legal at any point during pregnancy even when the baby is fully developed. I do not believe this to be true but I\u2019m struggling to find the details on the changes Labour intend to make to abortion law and would like clarification. Nicole, Hertfordshire\nHi Nicole, I\u2019m really interested (and concerned) to hear that that\u2019s out there, because it\u2019s not true. The only reference to abortion policy in the manifesto says: \u201cWe will uphold women\u2019s reproductive rights and decriminalise abortions.\u201d There is no reference to any plan to review the current policy. Thanks for asking that one.\nHas Labour made any indication that it would have a gender-balanced cabinet? Eric Ekong, 28, software engineer, London\nI haven\u2019t seen Jeremy Corbyn make that commitment explicitly, Eric, but he has repeatedly highlighted the gender balance in his shadow cabinet and contrasted that with the Conservatives\u2019 more male-dominated top team. So while he hasn\u2019t committed to keeping everyone in the same jobs if he got into Downing Street, I think it\u2019s highly likely he would maintain a balance.\nHave Labour published any deeper details on what the \u00a31bn public health investment might break down into? Health inequalities presumably need to be a focus. Joel, 30, working in the charity sector, Essex\nHi Joel, yes, the manifesto says a Labour government would make reducing health inequalities a clear target of public policy.\nThe \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and Labour says it would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses \u2013 and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity.\nTo try to make the target stick, the party also says it would introduce a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act \u2013 a law aimed at forcing the government to check the impact of all new policy on health inequality \u2013 and a new obligation on NHS agencies to cooperate with directors of public health.\nNext up will be the Guardian\u2019s in-house election psephologist, Dan Sabbagh, who is also the defence and security editor. He has plenty of experience of political journalism, having previously worked as a lobby reporter during the Theresa May phase of the Brexit crisis. Prior to that he was home editor, helping to run the Guardian\u2019s domestic coverage, including its politics team, from the news desk over two other elections and two referendums.\nHe will be answering any questions you may have about polling at 12.30pm on Friday.

Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes five and six.\nThis week reveals added layers of complexity on the money-laundering scheme. Soizic from the fraud squad explains how drug dealers needing to launder cash hook up with white-collar guys \u2013 like building contractor Pierre Solignac \u2013 to dodge tax or pay an illegal workforce. Supply meets demand. Gears within gears.Team Gilou don\u2019t care about any of that, of course. They police primarily on instinct, and hastily drawn crime infographics from fraud squad wonks simply won\u2019t cut it. They want summary justice for Herville, and frustration with the investigation\u2019s glacial pace leads them \u2013 as so often before \u2013 off\u2013the\u2013books and off\u2013the\u2013rails. In an unauthorised operation, JP and Tom run interference on Fouad so Laure can identify the client waiting for his cash delivery as Aline Lecomte MP. Further digging connects Lecomte to assets manager David Cann, currently represented by his old school buddy Edelman.\nThat intel comes at a heavy cost, though. Fouad is discovered shot through the head with the same gun that killed Wang and Herville. An exasperated Beckriche takes Laure and Gilou off the case before an apoplectic Roban trumps him, pulling both CID and the fraud squad and calling in homicide. Will this crew ever respect the chain of command?\nEmotionally, it\u2019s a bumpy ride for Commander Escoffier this week. Things heat up with Laure, as they have a fake makeout session to avoid being spotted by Fouad. Going rogue, commandeering a moped and chasing down a bad guy only intensify the mood. Adrenaline, close physical proximity and a fraught shared history are a heady cocktail.\nThat all changes though when Gilou hears that Laure has given custody of Romy over to the Br\u00e9monts. It brings back being dumped in the hospital car park all too keenly. \u201cI\u2019m getting out,\u201d he tells her, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you\u201d. He may even mean it, but who will ever understand him better than Laure?\nQuite apart from all the Gilou drama, Laure takes a battering this week. On medication for her depression and still reeling from losing custody of Romy, being taken off the Herville case is the last thing she needs. We know she doesn\u2019t do well without work. It could just be for the best when that other renegade fallen on hard times, Jos\u00e9phine, shows up on her doorstep, looking for a place to stay. Laure could do with the company, and it could be a long night when these two start comparing war stories. Speaking of Jos\u00e9phine\u2026\nHe\u2019s tried leaning on the president of the Law Society, witness tampering and a crooked reconstruction, but in the end it\u2019s just a few words whispered by Edelman in Vern\u2019s ear that gain Jos\u00e9phine\u2019s freedom. We may never know what he said, but it has Vern backpedalling away from his original testimony like it\u2019s radioactive waste. Edelman even offers her a job with him while she waits to get her license back.\nIt\u2019s enough to make a girl\u2019s heart melt, but all Jos\u00e9phine can think of is Lola. She insists that Edelman\u2019s firm take on her case, moved by the plight of a woman whose only crimes were blackmail, extortion and driving a young teacher to suicide. The press called Lola and her co-conspirator She Devils and Jos\u00e9phine absolutely likes the sound of that. A hint of gendered demonisation, a fight against the odds and a still-at-large accomplice to pursue? Ms Karlsson is all about that life.\nThey say that hospitals are some of the most dangerous places in the world and we\u2019re seeing plenty of evidence of that this year. We\u2019ve already had Mr Vouters\u2019 untimely death in the operating theatre, and now Fran\u00e7ois suffers a brutal head trauma when he walks into a sliding door, leaving him with a bloodied snozz and some tarnished pride. Still, he manages to score a dinner date with Dr Micaleff while he\u2019s recovering, having exonerated her from sole culpability in Vouters\u2019 death. It ends with a kiss, and the hope that Roban can waltz into retirement with a good woman on his arm.\n\u201cNo, hang on, you can\u2019t go behind Beckriche\u2019s back.\u201d Ali, showing some touching naivety. Gilou gives him a pep talk about the importance of being a team player and he reluctantly goes along, his objections noted for the record. He truly is the new Tintin.\nLaw enforcement want to identify an intermediary the network will need between the cash rich and the cash poor \u2013 someone who can easily navigate high and low society. Sounds a bit like Edelman?\nPity poor Rayan \u2013 his brother murdered, his mother barely acknowledging him and a prison stretch surrounded by predators awaiting him. The kid\u2019s dumb as a box of rocks and isn\u2019t tough enough to make up for it.\nThere\u2019s the hint of something romantic brewing between Gilou and the fraud squad\u2019s Soizic as she helps him decode the text messages. If he\u2019s looking for a way out from the folie \u00e0 deux he shares with Laure, this might be it.\nHow much does Edelman know? Can Laure bounce back? Is Gilou really getting out?

They sent the children to an aunt on Monday. Li and her mother-in law have developed symptoms and both have confirmed lung infections, which some doctors say should be reason enough to be quarantined. Li has been vomiting and had diarrhoea.\nThey have had no instructions from Wuhan\u2019s centre for disease control, nor from the neighbourhood committee, which is in charge of communicating with health authorities and hospitals to arrange for treatment and follow-ups. Li posted on the microblog Weibo pleading for help, one of hundreds of posts in the last few days. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I will collapse. I have called almost every number, everywhere,\u201d Li said. \u201cWherever we go, no one cares about us.\u201d\nMore than 24,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus, which has killed almost 500 people. The bulk of infections and deaths have been in China\u2019s central Hubei province, population 50 million, which has been in a state of lockdown for the last two weeks.\nInfected residents and their relatives interviewed by the Guardian described a sense of helplessness and mounting outrage as they tried to get help for sick family members and shield healthy ones, often children.\nOne woman said she had taken her elderly parents to three hospitals searching for space for them. By the time they reached the last one, which had no free beds, her parents were so feverish they were unable to make the journey home. She put blankets on the floor outside the observation ward and they slept there. Her mother died this past week, having never made it to a hospital.\nThe majority of deaths have been among people over the age of 60, but the virus has also affected the middle-aged and young, with symptoms ranging from coughing, fevers and body aches to fainting, coughing up blood, extreme difficulty breathing, chest pain and weakness.\nFor some, the hardest part has been the isolation. It has been nine days since Yan, 37, last saw her husband and two children, an 11-month-old girl and an 11-year-old boy. After Yan developed a fever in late January, she separated herself from them and moved into her mother\u2019s apartment.

As Li\u2019s husband\u2019s condition gets worse and she worries about her own health, she has become increasingly frustrated about being bounced between different government institutions.

Hardly \u2013 they are in the thick of it and being called out\nIf there was one thing that united the founders of today\u2019s tech giants in their early days it was contempt for politics, manifested as suspicion of government and a pathological aversion to regulation (not to mention paying taxes). In part, this was a product of their origins in the counterculture of the 1960s. But the aversion endured as the companies grew. One saw it, for example, in the US poet and cyberlibertarian John Perry Barlow\u2019s 1996 Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace. \u201cGovernments of the Industrial World,\u201d it began, \u201cI come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.\u201d\nFor many years, Silicon Valley companies didn\u2019t even bother to have lobbyists in Washington. As late as 2015, Eric Schmidt, then the executive chairman of Google, was predicting that authoritarian governments would wither away in a comprehensively networked world, which made some of us wonder what exactly Dr Schmidt was smoking.\nDuring that period, governments generally played along with this myth of their irrelevance. Presidents and prime ministers queued up for invitations to the campuses of the Silicon Valley giants. And insofar as the tech moguls paid any attention to presidential politics, it was to support the Democrats. Schmidt, for example, played a big role in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for the presidency.\nUnsurprisingly, the valley was thunderstruck by the election of Donald Trump. One of his first acts as president-elect was to summon the tech bosses to a \u201csummit\u201d in the White House. And most of them came, slinking in like frightened schoolboys summoned to the headmaster\u2019s study for smoking behind the bike sheds. The only attendee who seemed genuinely relaxed to be there was PayPal\u2019s co-founder Peter Thiel, but then he was the only one of them who had actively supported Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency.\nFrom the beginning, Trump in the White House was bad news for the companies. Google, for example, was roiled by dissent among its staff, many if not most of whom abhorred the president. Last week, Wired published an extensive cover story chronicling three torrid years of culture wars inside a company that had resolutely projected an air of chippy, creative progress towards world domination. Over those years, the report claims, \u201cthe company would find itself in the same position over and over again: a nearly $800bn planetary force seemingly powerless against groups of employees \u2013 on the left and the right \u2013 who could hold the company hostage to its own public image\u201d.\nGoogle\u2019s bosses were running a secret project to build a search engine that would be acceptable to Xi Jinping and co. Eventually, it was scrapped\nFour issues in particular emerged to cause trouble, Wired claims. One was the discovery that among Google geeks there was a vocal minority of rightwingers who were unimpressed by their employer\u2019s vaunted commitment to gender and ethnic diversity. Another was the revelation that Google had apparently given favourable treatment to senior male staff who were accused of sexual harassment. (One such was given a fond farewell and $90m to ease the pain of departure.)

It transpired that Google\u2019s bosses were running a secret project to build a search engine that would be acceptable to Xi Jinping and co. Eventually, it was scrapped, but not before a lot of damage had been done to internal morale. And then, recently, Thiel put the boot in, via an op-ed piece in the New York Times, in which he asked why Google was starting a new AI lab in China while ending an AI project with the Pentagon. Whose side is the company on in the new cold war opening up between the US and China?\nThis is the kind of overtly political question \u2013 about patriotism \u2013 that Silicon Valley companies are not accustomed to being asked. The fact that it is posed by the founder of Palantir, a $20bn big-data company that was set up with the help of $2m from the CIA\u2019s investment arm, is ironic. Especially when one remembers that Palantir has a $38m contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that implements the Trump administration\u2019s detention, deportation and family-separation policies.\nInterestingly, Thiel himself has so much faith in the US that he has become a citizen of New Zealand. \u201cI believe in New Zealand,\u201d he declared, \u201cand I believe the future of New Zealand\u2019s technology industry is still underrated.

Bosses, he insists, must commit to fighting inequality and tackling the climate emergency.\n\u201cWe are about to commit the biggest intergenerational crime in the history of mankind. We need to bring us together not drive us apart,\u201d said the 63-year-old Dutchman, who won plaudits for pushing the benefits of sustainable business long before it became fashionable.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t address inequality and climate change, to keep it simple, a lot more people are going to be dissatisfied, feel not included or left behind, and making these choices of rejection at the ballot box. The fact we are having these issues of populism and schisms in society is exactly because we are not addressing the underlying issue to evolve capitalism and make sure it works for everybody,\u201d he said. \nHe believes the starting point is \u201cheroic chief executives willing to step up and move outside of the comfort zone and take personal risks. I tried to do the same with Unilever. It\u2019s a matter of willpower.\u201d\nPolman has backed his words with cash by investing in Imagine, a foundation to push the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals. But he has several other projects on the go, including helping the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the boss of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner Kering, to develop a fashion-industry deal to cut waste and carbon emissions that is set to be announced at the G7 meeting in Biarritz next month. Polman said the aim is to get a fifth of the industry on board. He his hoping that signatories including the Calvin Klein owner PVH, H&M and Inditex, the owner of Zara, will inspire others.\nPolman is also backing an initiative that adopts similar tactics to advance disability rights, Valuable 500. The campaign, which is aiming to recruit 500 chief executives of major companies who commit to putting disability on their board agenda this year, has just won the backing of seven major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, HSBC and Lloyds. The banks join existing signatories, including Barclays, Accenture, Microsoft, Virgin Media and Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\u201cWe are trying to create tipping points on a sectorial level. The premise is that chief executives in the private sector need to drive major change in the absence of politicians doing it right now. Not exclusively but actively helping de-risk the political process,\u201d Polman said.\n\u201cOver the next 10 years more responsibility will be put on business to move faster to implement the [UN\u2019s] sustainability goals simply because of financial flow that needs to happen that cannot come right now from government.\u201d\nWith only 100 companies responsible for 71% of carbon emissions , persuading a handful of these bosses to see the economic and moral benefit of changing their ways can create a race to the top, according to Polman.\nThe boss who has publicly backed the young people behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of the teenage activist Greta Thunberg, said businesses that do not embrace issues of diversity, sustainability and equal rights will also struggle to attract talented young workers.\n\u201cMillennials want to work for companies that stand for more than just making money.\u201d\nPolman said he is no longer ridiculed for suggesting that tackling climate change makes business sense and that companies are also beginning to see that addressing equal rights is just as important.\n\u201cWe are now at a point in society where the cost of not acting in these areas is higher than acting. It is becoming mainstream. It comes down to humans, that\u2019s the missing element,\u201d Polman said.\nCaroline Casey, the founder of the Valuable 500 campaign, hopes that persuading key business leaders, such as Richard Branson, who has dyslexia, to be more open about their own disabilities and take action to make their companies more inclusive will demonstrate change is \u201cgood for business, good for people with disability and good for society in general\u201d.\nShe points out that there are about 13m people with disabilities in the UK who, together with their families, have a spending power of \u00a3249bn. However, businesses pay them far less attention than vegans, for example, who number less than one million.\nPeople with disabilities are also valuable employees who may be concealing non-obvious conditions such as autism, mental health problems or even blindness in the workplace.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cost to exclusion because we\u2019re not releasing potential,\u201d Casey said.", "label": 0}, "text-689": {"text": "Macron wants not just reform but to change the way France thinks\nPensions reform in France is like the rumbustious games of proto-football played by whole towns in England and Scotland of the past. At regular intervals \u2013 most recently in 1993, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2010 \u2013 the French government competes against a large part of the country\u2019s population. After days or weeks of confused conflict the two teams retire, exhausted. Small concessions of ground are made. No clear goals are scored by either side.\nThe only exception was 1995 when the France v Jacques Chirac and Alain Jupp\u00e9 game went into prolonged extra time (three weeks of transport strikes) before the government caved in more or less completely. A rare, undisputed goal for \u201cthe people\u201d.\nThe other recent pensions battles, from 1993 to 2010, have ended in draws, with radical reforms withdrawn or avoided in favour of patch-up jobs to keep the country\u2019s sprawling, Kafkaesque state pensions system limping along for another few years.\nEnter, stage centre, an ambitious young man, more visionary than politician, who decides that he can succeed where his feeble predecessors have failed.\nThere is no especially pressing reason to reform the system \u2013 or the 42 different systems \u2013 right now. The jumble of regimes, supposedly funded by levies on workers and employers, are not losing too much money. The \u20ac8bn in annual subsidies from the taxpayer are more or less affordable (even the \u20ac3bn that goes on allowing railway workers to retire in the prime of life).\nBut Emmanuel Macron wants not just to reform France. He wants permanently to change the way that France thinks. His other social reforms, including more flexible employment laws, have been a success. The country is creating jobs hand over fist. He has, more or less, fought off the gilets jaunes movement without doing a great deal for the struggling small towns and outer suburbs where it began.\nA sensible, practical politician might decide that he should drift prudently to the presidential election in 2022, tilting at the broken windmills in Europe and Nato but leaving domestic policy alone.\nNot Macron. He has declared holy war on the pensions system in his election campaign in 2022. The jumble of conflicting rights (in which the poor sometimes subsidise the well-off) is an offence to his abstract sense of order and justice.\nHe also disapproves of the fact that France, overall, works less hours than any other OECD country. Early retirement is a principal reason. The official pension age is 62 but railway, electricity and some other workers retire on generous pensions in their early or mid-50s.\nIn any case, pensions reform has become the great symbol of a supposedly immovable France. It is, Macron believes, a dragon that must be slain if the country is to be prepared for the opportunities and cruel tests of the 21st century.\nMacron\u2019s government produced the broad outline of its pension plan in July. There would be a single system instead of 42. Each employee would build up a personal fund of \u201cretirement points\u201d, which could be transferred from job to job and would be based on an average of earnings. No one would get less than \u20ac1,000 a month. The new system would take effect fully in 2025.\nThe result was cacophony. Everyone was angry. Rail workers and others were going to lose their sweetheart deals. Teachers, nurses, doctors, lawyers, police, civil servants and others would lose the deals by which pensions are calculated on final earnings not a career average.\nFor months, the government\u2019s efforts to sell the proposals were strangely half-hearted and disjointed. The moderate unions, who accept the principal of reform, became angry and confused. The militant unions smelled blood \u2013 and a route back to influence and power. The gilets jaunes, in their original anti-political form, had rejected France\u2019s much divided trades unions movement as useless and corrupt.\nMilitant unions and left-wing and hard-right politicians pummelled the proposed reforms with attacks ranging from the reasonable to the fictitious: Macron wanted people to work longer (true) and wanted to cut everyone\u2019s pension, including those already retired (not true).\nAnd so with the transport strikes starting last Thursday there began a new round of pensions proto-football, \u201cthe government v a large part of the people\u201d. Will anyone win this time? Macron and his government are already looking for ways to declare a draw in talks with the unions tomorrow. The prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, will offer to delay the de facto start of the new system to 2035 or maybe even 2039. That would be three or four presidential elections away.\nWhat would be the point of such a slow-motion reform? A faint symbolic victory for Macron. What would be the point of the unions refusing such a slow-motion reform? To defeat Macron and to be seen to defeat him.

Does even Paltrow take herself seriously?\nIn a speech, Stevens referenced Goop as he criticised \u201cquacks, charlatans and cranks\u201d in the wellness industry. While making serious points about the dangers of the anti-vaccination movement, he railed against \u201cdubious wellness products and dodgy procedures\u201d, going on to mention \u201cjade eggs and unusually scented candles\u2026 and a new TV series in which [Paltrow] and her team test vampire facials\u201d. Quite. Goop is infamous for its ludicrous, expensive quackery. But since when did it masquerade as a viable alternative to the NHS?\nI doubt I\u2019m in Goop\u2019s target market \u2013 I\u2019m too old and cynical. When I had a quick peek at The Goop Lab with Gwyneth Paltrow on Netflix, it was just as I\u2019d expected \u2013 a bunch of earnest yoga-hippies in overpriced stretchy clobber with too much Me!-time on their hands, to whom you could probably sell Tower Bridge if you dabbed enough patchouli oil on it. This kind of thing adheres rather too closely to the \u201ceat, pray, embrace your narcissism\u201d belief system, but if people are absolutely determined to shove jade eggs where the sun doesn\u2019t shine, then how are we to stop them?\nFor all that some of us recoil at the excesses of Goop (I will doubtless thrash about on my deathbed, hallucinating and screaming: \u201cNo, Gwynnie, please don\u2019t steam my vagina!\u201d), is anyone actively being misled? Goop is clear that it covers \u201cemerging topics that may be unsupported by science\u201d. That it sells fantasy, entertainment, indulgence, diversion \u2013 as opposed to, say, a fully functioning A&E department. Arguably the saving grace of the Zen hard sell of Goop is its modicum of self-awareness; it knows it has naff all to do with health. It\u2019s just a wellness brand \u2013 expecting it to hold to scientific/medical criteria is like expecting a lip gloss to do a handstand.\nStevens was right to blast Goop products and philosophies, but did he think the rest of us hadn\u2019t noticed? Add those prohibitive prices into the mix and it becomes yet clearer that Goop is far too expensive and elitist to have too much impact on the real world. This is what makes Stevens\u2019s attack seem a little overheated, though perhaps I should cut him some slack. It must be simpler and easier for a chief executive to rail against Goop than to give a speech about all the huge, real and complex problems (not least under-funding and dismantling) facing the NHS.\nAs for Paltrow, it\u2019s doubtful she\u2019d be alarmed by the criticism. Her recent marketing wheeze, the instantly notorious \u201csmells like my vagina\u201d candle, confirmed my long-held suspicion that, never mind the acting background, or even the multizillion-dollar wellness brand, Gwyneth Paltrow, a woman clearly not without humour, should be congratulated on yet another successful career as a world-class provocatrice.\nOh no, part of President Trump\u2019s wall has blown over in the wind. One of his key electoral promises was to build a wall between Mexico and America. \u201cI would build a great wall,\u201d he said Trump.. \u201cAnd nobody builds walls better than me.\u201d Psst, Donald, when you said \u201cnobody\u201d there, did you mean pre-schoolers armed only with Play-Doh and lollipop sticks?\nThe affected section of wall was about 130ft long, and fell on to trees on the Mexican side. I say \u201cwall\u201d, but Trump\u2019s plans have been repeatedly scaled back. It appears to have been downgraded to iron panels slapped on to gaps in the existing border \u2013 a bit like when you put a bin against a hole in the fence to stop the dog getting out. Elsewhere, the \u201cwall\u201d turned into 14 miles of wooden slatted fencing, which suggests there must have been one hell of a sale going on at whatever passes for Homebase now in America.\nSo far, on the Build a Wall scoreboard, I make that Mexicans 1, Trump 0. Trump hasn\u2019t built a wall, he\u2019s just patched up the old barrier. While the cost has been criticised (Trump just tried to divert a further $7.2bn from the Pentagon\u2019s budget), the result has been mocked, not least by an eight-year-old girl who was videoed breezily climbing an 18ft replica of Trump\u2019s \u201cvirtually impenetrable\u201d wall, built in a rock-climbing park in Kentucky. Another man climbed the replica wall while juggling with one hand.\nIt\u2019s reported that the wall fell because the cement holding it failed to stiffen. So the plot thickened but the cement didn\u2019t? As Trump is enduring all kinds of nightmarish structural collapses at the moment, it would be unseemly to mock.

In this regard, the delay with which the wealth of knowledge made available by the world of research is used to reduce the anthropogenic pollutant emissions widely present in both continental and marine environmental systems is deplorable.\nBut we must be aware that CARBON DIOXIDE IS ITSELF NOT A POLLUTANT. On the contrary, it is indispensable for life on our planet.\nIn recent decades, a thesis has spread that the heating of the Earth\u2019s surface of around 0.9\u00b0C observed from 1850 onwards would be anomalous and caused exclusively by human activities, in particular by the emission of CO2 from the use of fossil fuels in the atmosphere.\nThis is the thesis of anthropic global warming [Anthropogenic Global Warming] promoted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations, whose consequences would be environmental changes so serious as to fear enormous damage in an imminent future, unless drastic and costly mitigation measures do not are immediately adopted.\nIn this regard, many nations of the world have joined programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and are pressed, even by a throbbing propaganda, to adopt increasingly demanding programs whose implementation, which involves heavy burdens on the economies of the individual member states, it would depend on climate control and, therefore, the \u201csalvation\u201d of the planet.\nHowever, the anthropic origin of global warming IS AN UNPROVEN HYPOTHESIS, deduced only from some climate models, that is complex computer programs, called General Circulation Models .\nOn the contrary, the scientific literature has increasingly highlighted the existence of a natural climatic variability that the models are not able to reproduce.\nThis natural variability explains a substantial part of global warming observed since 1850.\nThe anthropic responsibility for climate change observed in the last century is therefore UNJUSTIFIABLY EXAGGERATED and catastrophic predictions ARE NOT REALISTIC.\nThe climate is the most complex system on our planet, so it needs to be addressed with methods that are adequate and consistent with its level of complexity.\nClimate simulation models do not reproduce the observed natural variability of the climate and, in particular, do not reconstruct the warm periods of the last 10,000 years. These were repeated about every thousand years and include the well-known Medieval Warm Period , the Hot Roman Period, and generally warm periods during the Optimal Holocene period .\nThese PERIODS OF THE PAST HAVE ALSO BEEN WARMER THAN THE PRESENT PERIOD, despite the CO2 concentration being lower than the current, while they are related to the millennial cycles of solar activity.\u00a0These effects are not reproduced by the models.\nIt should be remembered that the heating observed since 1900 has actually started in the 1700s, ie at the minimum of the Little Ice Age , the coldest period of the last 10,000 years (corresponding to the millennial minimum of solar activity that astrophysicists call Maunder Minimal Solar ). Since then, solar activity, following its millennial cycle, has increased by heating the earth\u2019s surface.\nFurthermore, the models fail to reproduce the known climatic oscillations of about 60 years.\nThese were responsible, for example, for a warming period (1850-1880) followed by a cooling period (1880-1910), a heating (1910-40), a cooling (1940-70) and a a new warming period (1970-2000) similar to that observed 60 years earlier.\nThe following years (2000-2019) saw the increase not predicted by the models of about 0.2 \u00b0 C\u00a0 [two tenths of a degree] per decade, but a substantial climatic stability that was sporadically interrupted by the rapid natural oscillations of the equatorial Pacific ocean, known as the El Nino Southern Oscillations , like the one that led to temporary warming between 2015 and 2016.\nThe media also claim that extreme events, such as hurricanes and cyclones, have increased alarmingly. Conversely, these events, like many climate systems, have been modulated since the aforementioned 60-year cycle.\nFor example, if we consider the official data from 1880 on tropical Atlantic cyclones that hit North America, they appear to have a strong 60-year oscillation, correlated with the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s thermal oscillation called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .\nThe peaks observed per decade are compatible with each other in the years 1880-90, 1940-50 and 1995-2005. From 2005 to 2015 the number of cyclones decreased precisely following the aforementioned cycle. Thus, in the period 1880-2015, between number of cyclones (which oscillates) and CO 2 (which increases monotonically) there is no correlation.\nThe climate system is not yet sufficiently understood. Although it is true that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, according to the IPCC itself the climate sensitivity to its increase in the atmosphere is still extremely uncertain.\nIt is estimated that a doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2, from around 300 ppm pre-industrial to 600 ppm, can raise the average temperature of the planet from a minimum of 1 \u00b0 C to a maximum of 5 \u00b0 C.\nThis uncertainty is enormous.\nIn any case, many recent studies based on experimental data estimate that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is CONSIDERABLY LOWER than that estimated by the IPCC models.\nThen, it is scientifically unrealistic to attribute to humans the responsibility for warming observed from the past century to today. The advanced alarmist forecasts, therefore, are not credible, since they are based on models whose results contradict the experimental data.\nAll the evidence suggests that these MODELS OVERESTIMATE the anthropic contribution and underestimate the natural climatic variability, especially that induced by the sun, the moon, and ocean oscillations.\nFinally, the media release the message according to which, with regard to the human causeof current climate change, there would be an almost unanimous consensus among scientists that the scientific debate would be closed.\nHowever, first of all we must be aware that the scientific method dictates that the facts, and not the number of adherents, make a conjecture a consolidated scientific theory .\nIn any case, the same alleged consensus DOES NOT EXIST. In fact, there is a remarkable variability of opinions among specialists \u2013 climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, astrophysicists \u2013 many of whom recognize an important natural contribution to global warming observed from the pre-industrial period and even from the post-war period to today.\nThere have also been petitions signed by thousands of scientists who have expressed dissent with the conjecture of anthropic global warming.\nThese include the one promoted in 2007 by the physicist F. Seitz, former president of the American National Academy of Sciences, and the one promoted by the Non-governmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), whose 2009 report concludes that \u201cNature does not the activity of Man governs the climate \u201d.\nIn conclusion, given the CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE THAT FOSSIL FUELS have for the energy supply of humanity, we suggest that they do not adhere to policies of uncritical reduction of the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere with THE ILLUSORY PRETENSE OF GOVERNING THE CLIMATE.\nPROMOTING COMMITTEE:", "label": 1}, "text-692": {"text": "China's young climate heroes fight apathy \u2013 and the party line\nOne is a student engineer who became obsessed after watching an incendiary film about air pollution.

Solar power attracted around half of the total investment in renewables over the last decade and has grown from 25GW at the beginning of 2010 to an expected 638GW by the close of 2019.\nJon Moore, the chief executive of BloombergNEF, said the sharp falls in the cost of electricity from wind and solar over recent years has \u201ctransformed the choice facing policymakers\u201d.\n\u201cThese technologies were always low carbon and relatively quick to build.

Don't be\nWhat are Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s politics? Based on recent events, one might assume the young billionaire favors American conservatism, even explicit Republican positions.\nOn Thursday, NBC News revealed that the CEO of Facebook had a secret dinner at the White House in October with President Donald Trump. Zuckerberg was accompanied by Facebook board member and long-time mentor Peter Thiel. Thiel is notorious among Silicon Valley billionaires for explicitly endorsing Trump in 2016 and speaking at the Republican National Convention that year. Thiel, a libertarian who runs a company that enhances government surveillance efforts, has also questioned the value of women voting.\nThat October dinner was the second in two months at which Zuckerberg dined with Trump. It followed a series of dinners at Zuckerberg\u2019s home in California with conservative pundits and activists like white supremacist Tucker Carlson of Fox News.\nRecently, Zuckerberg has warned his employees that the potential election of liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren to the presidency would be an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to his company. And when Senator Bernie Sanders suggested taxing his fellow billionaires to fund essential government programs, Zuckerberg responded that billionaires might know better than government-sponsored scientists how to deploy resources as precious as funds for research.\nBut if I had asked that question about Zuckerberg\u2019s politics in 2016, I could have listed such incidents as his full embrace of immigration reform and an increase in the sort of visa that allows immigrants to work for US technology companies in large numbers. Zuckerberg used to march in pride parades and Facebook was among a number of companies that filed briefs supporting the court case to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States.\nPresident Barack Obama and Zuckerberg were close throughout the eight years of the Obama presidency. They appeared together at several public events and Zuckerberg even called the president after the revelations from Edward Snowden showed that the US government had tapped Facebook\u2019s system to surveil private communications.\nAnd, despite all the panic about Cambridge Analytica allegedly using Facebook user data to help Republican electoral efforts, Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign also exported data on millions of voters and deployed them to target get-out-the-vote efforts.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Zuckerberg\u2019s politics are issue-specific and generally party-agnostic. He has always wanted US immigration policy to supply his company with exploitable foreign labor. He wants his taxes to be low so he and his buddies can decide how to fund schools and efforts to fight climate change.\nZuckerberg generally takes the sort of libertarian view toward the free movement of people around the globe. His social milieu has always been elite, educated, multicultural, and wealthy. He has learned his politics from mentors who take a \u201cnoblesse oblige\u201d attitude toward the world.\nZuckerberg dropped out of Harvard after two years. Zuckerberg has enrolled for the past decade at the University of Davos, where rich people pretend they are smart and smart people pander to the rich. If someone chooses to study world politics from Henry Kissinger, you can assume that he will have some twisted views of how the world works.\nZuckerberg\u2019s politics favor two things: the interests of Facebook and people like him. So it\u2019s no wonder Zuckerberg got close to the two American presidents who have served over his company\u2019s history. Since the the world abandoned its mindless worship of Facebook and Silicon Valley in recent years, Zuckerberg has been on a constant if unsuccessful campaign to save face and stem efforts to regulate or fracture his company.\nSo the problem with Zuckerberg\u2019s politics is not just that they seem to have turned to the right. His politics have not changed at all. The world has. The problem is that by choosing an amoral set of principles and positions he has become deeply immoral.\nFacebook placed staff in the offices of Rodrigo Duterte when he ran for president of the Philippines in 2016, even though Duterte ran on an explicit platform of vigilante violence and extrajudicial killings \u2013 a pledge he has kept since riding Facebook\u2019s communicative power to victory. Zuckerberg had business reasons to help Duterte, and did not let Duterte\u2019s brutality get in the way.\nZuckerberg has hugged Narendra Modi, who has ruled India since 2014 by stirring up Hindu nationalist sentiments and crushing the interests of Muslims. Zuckerberg has never expressed misgivings about that alliance, and Modi, like Duterte, rode Facebook and WhatsApp to victory in his elections.\nFacebook placed staff with the 2016 Trump campaign as well, even though Trump made racist statements in his campaign launch speech in 2015 and his administration has proceeded to kidnap children from their parents by the thousands and to brutalize those who seek asylum in the United States. Zuckerberg\u2019s most dangerous political belief is his firm conviction that what\u2019s good for Facebook is good for the world.\nAt the very moment when the US House of Representatives reveals overwhelming evidence that Trump used his power as president to support his re-election campaign and bolster his friend Vladimir Putin by withholding support from Ukraine, Zuckerberg continues to treat the Trump White House as just another potential regulator who must be charmed.\nDemocracy is in retreat around the world. Ethnic and racial violence \u2013 often state-supported \u2013 is on the rise. The social fabric is fraying. Our ability to think clearly about our great problems recedes a bit farther every day. Facebook has played a part in all of that. Yet the company\u2019s leader, who was until recently lauded as a role model for the young, stays out of the fray.\nZuckerberg\u2019s unwillingness to take a stand for basic human decency, his insistence that all politics are merely instrumental to the fortunes of his company, and his belief that he knows best, show him to be political in the most craven ways.\nSiva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and the author of Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy", "label": 0}, "text-696": {"text": "Sports Direct's Mike Ashley apologises for poor Covid-19 actions\nMike Ashley has issued a public apology after his spat with the government about trying to keep his Sports Direct chain open when non-essential businesses were ordered to close.\nAshley\u2019s Frasers Group, which includes House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, had intended to keep Sports Direct open as other non-essential retailers closed, on the basis that selling sporting and fitness equipment made the company a vital asset as Britons were forced to stay at home.\nHe eventually bowed to government pressure and shut his stores on Tuesday but is continuing to operate online via the group\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse, where the company has admitted it is struggling to enforce the government\u2019s Covid-19 regulations for thousands of workers. \nPeople in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:\nPolice will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

By harnessing air quality data from a range of sources, they were able to estimate PM2.5 levels for each patient based on their home zip code.\nThe team then compared air pollution levels for each patient during the two days around their hospital visit with levels from other points in time. \nThis approach essentially takes into account factors such as age, socioeconomic status and even obesity, since it uses each patient as their own reference. Fluctuations in air temperature and other factors were taken into account separately.\nThe results back up previous studies showing a link between short-term exposure to dirty air and conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia and heart attack.\nIndeed, the analysis suggests even a small average rise in PM2.5 of 1 micrograms per cubic metre over a two-day period is linked to an increase of 68 older people per billion being taken to hospital with heart failure the next day.\nPut another way, that increase in air pollution raises the risk of such people being hospitalised with heart failure by 0.14% .\nHowever, the team also found diseases including septicaemia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and urinary tract infections were associated with poorer air quality. For the latter, the team estimate the short-term rise in PM2.5 is linked to a further 39 older people per billion being taken to hospital the next day.\nWhile the increases in risk might look small, the team say a 1 micrograms per cubic metre rise in PM2.5 levels occurred on more than 122 days in each year within each zip code.\nThe team\u2019s analysis further reveals air pollution is linked to more than just hospital visits: the data shows short-term increases in PM2.5 were linked to an average annual increase of 634 deaths, and about $100m in costs for inpatients and post-acute care.\nEven when the team looked at days when the air quality was within the limits set by the WHO, they found the trends remained.\nYaguang Wei, first author of the study, said the research suggested the health effects of PM2.5 were not restricted within individual organs. \u201cIt has a more systemic effect on multiple pathophysiological processes such as inflammation, infection, and water electrolyte balance,\u201d he said, although the details remain unclear.\nWhile the study cannot prove that air pollution causes the diseases, the team say it adds weight to calls for air pollution guidelines to be reviewed. \nDr Ioannis Bakolis, of King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study, agreed. He said: \u201cThese guidelines needs to be revised, as even the 9% of the population that lives within the WHO limits may be substantially by affected by air pollution concentrations and its associated costs, according to the findings of the study.\u201d\nHowever, the study has limitations, including that it looked only at one component of air pollution and only considered outdoor air pollution near patients\u2019 homes.\nWhat\u2019s more, it does not account for short-term changes in behaviour that might have varied with air pollution levels \u2013 such as physical activity levels \u2013 while it is not clear if the results would hold in those not enrolled in Medicare, including younger people.\nWriting in an accompanying editorial, a team of experts from the University of Southampton say the study suggests figures for the number of early deaths down to air pollution \u2013 put at 800,000 a year in Europe \u2013 are likely to be considerable underestimates, and stressed action is needed.\n \u201cClearly, there is much still to learn, but we should not mistake knowledge gaps for paucity of evidence,\u201d they write. \u201cThe sooner we act, the sooner the world\u2019s population will reap the benefits.\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-698": {"text": "Brexit can pave the way to a new politics\nGary Younge (A party not fit for power, and a system not fit for purpose, 29 March) is spot on in identifying the crisis in our constitution that Brexit has unfolded, but he prescribes the wrong medicine.

Some of that money will be redistributed to lower-income earners, some will be given back to small businesses as a reduction in Alberta\u2019s small business tax, but at the end of the day, the government expects to net $6 billion to fund a giant green energy spending spree.\n\nAccording to estimates in the Edmonton Journal, the new tax scheme will cost a family of four about $338 extra in 2017, rising to $508.00 in 2018 in direct energy costs, and another $70 to $105 in \u201cindirect costs,\u201d that is, when products and services have to increase in price as a result of the tax on producers and service providers.\n\nThe legislation at about 100 pages long includes three acts, one to establish the carbon tax, one to allow for reductions in small business taxes, and one to create a new Crown corporation to spend the tax revenues, called \u201cEnergy Efficiency Alberta.\u201d\n\nThe mandate of this corporation is: (a) to raise awareness among energy consumers of energy use and the associated economic and environmental consequences, (b) to promote, design and deliver programs and carry out other activities related to energy efficiency, energy conservation and the development of micro-generation and small-scale energy systems in Alberta, and (c) to promote the development of an energy efficiency services industry.\n\nBut as we pointed out in a recent study by the Fraser Institute, this approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions has been tried\u2014and failed\u2014repeatedly in both the United States and Canada. Ontario has done a masterful job at avoiding transparency with regard to the benefits of its \u201cdemand-side management programs,\u201d despite spending some $400 million on efficiency programs in 2013 alone.\n\nThe most rigorous study of a home efficiency program in the United States, the $5 billion Weatherization Assistance Program, looked at 34,000 homes, where some were aggressively offered weatherization assistance and some were not. The study, conducted at uber-environmentalist University of California, Berkeley found that of the households aggressively offered assistance with weatherization, only six per cent actually followed through to participate in the weatherization program. Only one per cent of the non-outreach households did so. And the households that participated did reduce energy consumption by some 20 per cent, but\u2014and it\u2019s a big but\u2014they spent twice as much money on the retrofits than they saved in reduced energy spending. And that 20 per cent reduction was far below the economic models used to promote the program.\n\nAnd as researchers at the Breakthrough Institute have found, efficiency programs are subject to the \u201crebound effect,\u201d also known as the Jevon\u2019s Paradox. That is, if you actually do make things more energy efficient, people tend to buy more energy-consuming products, wiping out any potential reductions in either energy consumption or emissions related to it. They point out that in developed countries, the rebound effect eliminates 40-60 per cent of potential emission reductions.\n\nAlberta\u2019s new climate plan, by the government\u2019s own admission, will not lead to significant greenhouse gas reductions for many years, if it ever does. The tax is far too low to have significant impacts on consumer behaviour, which is further proof that it is not \u201cmarket-based carbon pricing,\u201d it\u2019s simply a funding mechanism for bureaucratic expansion of failed efficiency programs, a mechanism for redistributing the wealth of Albertans, and a green fig leaf for an Alberta government that wants to look as if it\u2019s proactively promoting \u201csocial license\u201d for the continued development of Alberta\u2019s oilsands.", "label": 1}, "text-700": {"text": "'Politics off the front page' is part of Scott Morrison's bid to dial down the volume\nWhen Sky News opened its new Canberra studio in Parliament House late last year, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly was jokingly asked where his office would be.\nThe \u201cmember for Sky\u2019s\u201d regular appearances had become a running joke in Canberra, particularly as the outspoken conservative helped hammer the final nails into Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministerial casket.\nThe ability of a relatively unknown backbencher to have exerted such influence through pay TV was particularly remarkable given Sky has so few viewers.

It\u2019s also an attempt to make federal politics less personal, lest the Morrison government become yet another dreaded leadership story.\nIf Morrison\u2019s mission is Let\u2019s Make Politics Boring Again, then this week he chalked up a win. The issue of a flammable cladding taskforce, being spearheaded by Andrews, became a four-day news story. This came after news of a shake-up of the Australian prudential regulator managed to stay in the headlines for two days running. What a time to be alive.\nBut while the \u201cpolitics off the front page\u201d pitch is part of the strategy, Morrison also seems determined to bypass the media and talk directly to voters as much as possible.\nFollowing the well-trod path of Donald Trump and Pauline Hanson before him, Morrison has declared war on the \u201cCanberra bubble\u201d, taking to social media to directly communicate to voters while accusing the media of being out of step with the concerns of everyday Australians.\nIt is the same bubble that Morrison declared he had \u201cpopped\u201d with his election win (which he observed, perhaps somewhat ironically, on Sky News the day after his victory), and one which he is attempting to starve of some oxygen by reining in his most loquacious MPs.\nThere is some merit in his criticisms of federal political reporting.\nMost participants are happy to acknowledge its shortcomings: there is too much focus on conflict, too little interest in policy, and an unfortunate culture \u2013 cultivated by politicians, Morrison included \u2013 of \u201cdropping\u201d stories to friendly media.\nBut if Morrison is genuine about wanting to reform the culture of the derided \u201cbubble\u201d to ensure that journalists and MPs both share a laser-like focus on the Australian people, then there should be some acknowledgment that successive governments have made the job of public interest journalism more difficult.\nFurthermore, he could show the Australian people that he is genuine in wanting to get the best results for them by ensuring journalists can do their job of holding them to account, properly.\nThe list for reform is long. So-called Freedom of Information is a farce. Whistleblower protections are rubbish. Defamation laws are a mess. And raids on journalists show the government\u2019s national security laws now criminalise public interest reporting.\nSo while no one is expecting politics to stay dull for long \u2013 it never does \u2013 Morrison could certainly help make it worthier.\nThat way everyone could get on with doing their jobs.", "label": 0}, "text-701": {"text": "No great escape: Tory scales bins and fence to exit climate hustings\nIt is a common dilemma for any hard-bitten politician faced with a hostile crowd: how best to make a sharp exit to avoid embarrassment?\nFor one 63-year-old Tory councillor confronted with a less than receptive audience during a climate crisis debate the answer was to clamber over some bins and scale a fence.\nNancy Bikson was a last-minute replacement for the Conservative prospective MP Maria Caulfield, who was too \u201cbusy\u201d to attend climate hustings for candidates in the key marginal seat of Lewes, East Sussex, at a school on Monday evening.\nExplaining that she was afforded little time to prepare for the event organised by local groups, including a branch of Extinction Rebellion, Bikson said she would not be sticking around for questions after making a short speech. She attracted groans from the crowd, with one man heckling her before she even began speaking, asking: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go now?\u201d\nBikson said she cared deeply about the environment and that she \u201cdid her bit\u201d but concluded, to further groans: \u201cIt\u2019s all about us, there is no such thing as government. Government is just people.\u201d\nThough she eventually gained polite applause, Bikson left the stage after other candidates made speeches and the event was opened to questions from the audience.\nHowever, when she left via the fire escape she found herself outside in a dead end as the school gates were locked. Rather than trudging back through the packed hall to get out, she pondered her predicament for up to 45 minutes before opting to climb over the fence.\nBikson\u2019s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school.\nThe teenager, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cI left about an hour early and about half an hour after she [Bikson] left the stage. I came outside and I was about to cycle off and she was behind the gate next to our school canteen which was locked and said, \u2018excuse me, can you help me?\u2019 She sounded quite desperate. I said the only way back out is through the auditorium and she said she didn\u2019t want to go back through the auditorium because of everyone. She said \u2018they all despise me \u2026 and they don\u2019t want me to go back in there\u2019.\u201d \nExplaining that she felt sorry for the stranded politician, the teenager added: \u201cI went back into the canteen to try and open the door from the inside [allowing her a route of escape] but it was locked. Then I got a caretaker. I said a caretaker is coming but she said, \u2018don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll just climb over the gate\u2019. And she got up on the school bins and climbed over the gate. She\u2019d been out there for a while.\u201d\nAfter hearing the tale, the schoolgirl\u2019s mother, who runs a business managing composers, brought the councillor\u2019s ordeal to a wider audience, posting on Facebook: \u201cLewes Tory MP Maria Caulfield failed to show for tonight\u2019s climate hustings. Her last-minute replacement left the hall before the questions, having first explained that she knew nothing about climate or the environment.\n\u201cShe was spotted by my daughter 45 minutes later still trying to find her way off the premises without having to go back through the hall. She ended up climbing the fence via the bins. Ignominious.\u201d\nBikson apparently admitted her actions later, telling the Evening Standard on Tuesday \u201cIt was only because there wasn\u2019t any other way and I didn\u2019t want to disrupt everybody. It was either that or sit outside for a couple of hours.\u201d\nBut when the Guardian rang to get her version of events she was tight-lipped, replying: \u201cI can neither confirm nor deny, thank you.\u201d\nLewes was previously held by the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker for nearly two decades before being won by Brexiter Caufield in 2015. But the Conservatives only have a majority of just over 5,000, meaning the constituency, which narrowly voted remain during the EU referendum, is a top target for the Lib Dems.\n", "label": 0}, "text-702": {"text": "Sports quiz of the week: Premier League, Eden Hazard and sore feet", "label": 0}, "text-703": {"text": "No more 'man up': the push for better mental health at Hinkley C\nAngie Young, the health and wellbeing manger at the Hinkley Point C (HPC) site, does not hesitate when asked what the main cause of mental health issues there is. \u201cIt\u2019s loneliness. You\u2019re living away from home, living without your family. Loneliness is the big thing.\u201d\nBut a major complicating factor is that tough men who build stuff are not always great at talking about feelings. \u201cOur guys are construction guys \u2013 they are macho. The average age is 45-55. They haven\u2019t got someone nagging them to go and see someone. We\u2019re trying to address that.\u201d\nYoung is a veteran of major construction projects in the UK including the Channel tunnel, the Olympic Park and Terminal 5. \u201cMental health has always been the thing that has been brushed under the carpet,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the old days workers wouldn\u2019t cry. They would be told to man up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to generate an environment of openness. It\u2019s OK not to be OK. If we can get people to talk about mental health then we will have achieved something.\u201d\nThe construction industry has long had a challenge helping its workers through mental health issues. At a site such as HPC the challenge is particularly acute. More than 4,000 people \u2013 the majority of whom are men \u2013 are working on the site. Half live away from home.\nThe site is remote and conditions can be tough. Weather extremes can be sapping. Shifts can be long and the vastness of the project hard to take in.\nHPC and Duradiamond Healthcare, which runs the in-house health service, commissioned a business psychologist to undertake a site-wide mental health risk assessment.\nThe assessment highlighted that death from suicide among construction workers is 10 times more frequent than from accidents, and 25% of construction workers have considered taking their own lives. It also showed that 60% of workers did not tell their employers if time off was related to mental health, while 42% of workers were living with or trying to cope with mental health issues.\nDuradiamond accepts that the nature of HPC \u2013 the fact that so many are away from home \u2013 makes workers particularly vulnerable. In a press release issued after it won an industry award for its work on mental health, it said: \u201cSpecifically, people felt lonely, disconnected and not part of the community and this is particularly prevalent at HPC.\u201d\nA tour of the site gives glimpses into the work that is taking place to combat the problem. On the fence next to the main pedestrian entrance is a sign that reads: \u201cWe have 200 mental health buddies\u201d on site.\nThe mental health buddies \u2013 also known as mental health first aiders \u2013 undergo a two-day course recognised by the charity Mind. \u201cThey\u2019re not there to treat,\u201d said Young. \u201cThey are there to be a listening ear. Part of the training is to recognise signs that are red flags and to signpost people into help.\u201d There are male and female \u201cbuddies\u201d from a range of occupations, ages and levels of seniority.\nOne mental health buddy, who asked not to be named, said people talked about issues ranging from work-related stress to family issues. \u201cI speak to people every week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be a brief chat over a cup of tea in the canteen or I can spend an hour or couple of hours with them and give them time to open up.\u201d\nHe said it might appear that more people were suffering because they were now prepared to come forward. \u201cNow that people know they can speak up, the cases of people calling in pretending to have a bad back when they are just feeling low is going down. The culture has changed from people feeling they can\u2019t ring in with mental health problems.\u201d\nMental health awareness training is provided for managers and supervisors to try to create a supportive environment and help identify potential signs to allow early intervention. HPC is also in the process of recruiting a chaplain for the site \u2013 another person for people in crisis to talk to.\nDotted inside the site are \u201ctime to talk\u201d rooms \u2013 private spaces for conversations and to find contact details for help. A \u201ctime to talk\u201d day was held on site to encourage more openness.\nSpeakers are brought in to try to help. About 800 workers listened to the former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno talk about his own battle with mental health.\nWhen workers sit down to meals in the canteens, notices about mental health flash up and a mental health awareness page has been created on the TeamHinkleyC website and app.\nHelp and advice for apprentices is provided at on-site drop-in sessions in the apprentice and skills hub, which works with a local mental health charity, In Charley\u2019s Memory. A programme of support for apprentices, including advice on gambling, money management, healthy eating and life skills has been set up.\nThe HPC construction director, Rob Jordan, said much had been achieved but accepted there was more to do. \u201cWe have a thirst to do more; we\u2019re on a journey,\u201d he said. Jordan, an Australian, works away from his family. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like. People make sacrifices to be here. We want to take it to the next level.

The recent United Nations Climate report equally stressed socialist economic planning while the Paris Accord, from which President Trump withdrew, included $100 billion per year of aid from wealthy nations to Third World ones in compensation for past environmental damage to the world. That\u2019s why most of them voted for the accord.\nClimate change is happening in parts of the globe. It has been warmer in the Arctic, oceans are rising at the rate of about one foot per century, and there\u2019s been record cold in central Asia and in the Southern hemisphere, e.g . Argentina and Australia. Also indeed some record cold weather in the U.S.\nWhat the Warmers (climate changers) need to prove are three major points.\nUnfortunately, events are not being properly analyzed but rather have triggered a cascade of billions of Washington dollars to certain industries with effective lobbies. Global warming became climate change but the supposed remedies for the latter (limiting C02 gas) are claimed to be the same as for the former.\nThe movement\u2019s overwhelming control of Big Media leaves those calling for rational debate and plain common sense overwhelmed. Every excessive weather event is blamed on global warming and met with demands for new subsidies for some and obstructive regulations for traditional energy producers, i.e. more centralized planning from Washington. Typical of the scare stories which defy common sense was a recent scary front page report in the New York Times was \u201cOcean Temperatures Rising Faster \u2013new analysis suggests dire effect on food and weather.\u201d The article reports that \u201coceans are heating up 40% faster than a United Nations panel estimate five years ago.\u201d Yet typical of almost all the stories The Times almost never reports a word about the actual number of temperature degrees involved. Obviously, the reason is because it is infinitesimal. It turns out to be about one tenth of one degree centigrade (0.09 to 0.13 degrees) per decade over the past 40 years. That equals less than two tenths of one degree Fahrenheit. Similarly An EPA report shows in a graph 1 degree Fahrenheit increase in ocean surface temperature since 1980 and 1.5% increase since 1880. All these reports are also within the margin of error.\nScaring us about oceans rising is vital for the warmers because they can\u2019t really scare people with just two or three degrees of warmer air temperatures. Oceans are a vast temperature equalizer. They also absorb C02 gas from the air. Oceans can absorb incredible amounts of atmospheric heat and the deep ocean has not had temperature increases.\nThe Washington Post in a typical report to stoke up fear, headlined, Melting Arctic Ice now pouring 14,000 tons of melting ice into the oceans. The report states that this \u201cnow adds well over a millimeter to the level of the ocean every year.\u201d It no doubt assumes that most Americans don\u2019t know how long a millimeter is and the Post does not clarify that this equals about one foot per century, a recognized measure.\nThen there\u2019s the Antarctic. For years there was little media reporting that it was gaining more ice. Then some media discovered that much of the ice was on top of an ice shelf partly floating on the ocean. So then it reported that the seas were \u201cwarming\u201d (see below) and that the ice shelf might break off, melt and raise ocean levels several feet.\nThe most brazen assaults on common sense are typified by another NY Times article, \u201cWhy half a degree of warming is a big deal,\u201d with totally unproven or unprovable assumptions. I am reminded of an old joke from Soviet times about a commissar visiting a peasant village with a truck load of new shoes. He told the villagers about the glories of socialism and how all Russians would soon have new shoes compared to the torn, worn and ragged ones they wore. Then an old peasant woman dares to tell him that none of the shoes fit her or her friends\u2019 feet. The commissar looks down scowling, \u201cThese are the latest, newest wonderful socialist shoes, it is your foot that is the wrong size!\u201d I often think of this story when scare mongers tell us \u201cfacts\u201d which are contrary to all observations, reason and logic, that they just can\u2019t be true, and yet most people finally believe the constant propaganda.\nThe importance of media concentration on ocean warming and rising seas is because it is a way to get Americans\u2019 agreement to spend hundreds of billions of dollars upon it. Most of us can\u2019t be overwhelmed with fear because the atmosphere is warming by some 2 degrees. But we can be terrorized with fear of rising oceans inundating our great cities. It is preposterous to argue about 1.5 vs. 2 degrees centigrade difference in atmospheric warming; one is reminded of medieval scholars arguing about how many angels could stand on the head of a pin. Yet even The Economist reports that an extra half degrees would kill all coral reefs and \u201cwash away the livelihoods of millions more people.\u201d (10/13/2018)\nCarbon dioxide (C02) in the air is only one of the factors affecting weather. Most particularly is simple water vapor which is a much more potent \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d that C02. Weather is also affected by sun spots, volcanic activity, ocean currents, atmospheric reflectivity, and even the alignment of planets and their gravity. C02 is much less than one tenth of 1% of the atmosphere, actually .04% meaning 400 parts per million. All the global warming fuss is because it went up from .03% to .04%. If decreasing carbon dioxide is the cure for global warming, why do they promote the same solution for climate change when parts of the world are getting record cold weather?\nBelow are several arguments to stress if arguing with a global warmer. Remember though that for many leftists climate change has become almost a religion and so is little subject to rational argument. Most of us can\u2019t know all the details of each new lie or exaggeration. The only way to fight this is just to concentrate on a few arguments. Most global warmers can\u2019t explain or justify much of what they claim so they just smear those who question them or repeat the canard that \u201c97% of climate scientists agree than human beings are responsible for warming or climate change.\u201d The 97% figure has been effective rebutted. All the early models forecasts about weather and warming have been proved vastly exaggerated or even totally wrong. Why trust them now?\n\u201cFollow the climate money\u201d is the way to track much of the distorted science. Fear of climate change has generated tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars for some commercial interests. Think of tens of billions of subsidies for windmills and solar energy and even for selling expensive cars; in the case of Tesla $7,500 each for the first 200,000 buyers of electric automobiles equals over a billion dollars for one company. Billions more will soon be paid to other companies now starting to make electric cars.\nFor continuing information on this subject see the sites of Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute and CFact. They\u2019re all loaded with information to rebut and explain media scare stories. Their source of funding does include independent oil companies, a very few foundations and many individuals concerned with the overwhelming billions being spent by our government to respond to \u201chuman made\u201d climate change.", "label": 1}, "text-705": {"text": "Could America's wokest sport really be ... fencing?\nIf you think fencing, you may think of a sport practiced by the upper classes everywhere from elite universities to the denouement of Hamlet. Or you may picture Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, a film that put Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes through rigorous training to play the chivalrous duelists who became allies after a breathtaking scene that name-dropped actual fencing masters Bonetti, Capo Ferro, Thibault and Agrippa.\nBut, in the United States at least, fencing isn\u2019t just a pastime for the ossified, insular gentry. The American fencing community is relatively diverse and worldly. So it\u2019s no surprise that someone from this cosmopolitan community, Race Imboden, has taken athlete protests to the next level by kneeling on the podium after winning gold at the Pan-Am Games.\nImboden listed several reasons for his actions, including racism in the States and \u201ca president who spreads hate\u201d. He also mentioned gun control, a timely comment after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, and the equally timely issue of the US government\u2019s treatment of immigrants.\nThe 26-year-old Imboden, a two-time Olympian and bronze medalist in the 2016 team event, isn\u2019t the first athlete to kneel during the national anthem, a means of protest popularized by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. He\u2019s not even the first to kneel while wearing a US uniform, as Megan Rapinoe did at women\u2019s soccer friendlies in 2016. And Imboden himself took a knee, along with teammate Miles Chamley-Watson, at a World Cup event in 2017.\nBut kneeling at the Pan-Am Games has raised the stakes. It\u2019s not the biggest event on US television in August, but it\u2019s still an important event for America\u2019s Olympians. Imboden had company as well \u2013 American hammer thrower Gwen Berry raised a fist on the podium in a move reminiscent of John Carlos and Tommie Smith\u2019s iconic moment at the 1968 Olympics.\nImboden has support from his fellow fencers too. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see any athlete with a platform stand up for equality and against the rising hate in America, whether they are a soccer player, fencer or football player,\u201d says Becca Ward, who won two saber bronzes in the 2008 Olympics. \u201cWe all have a part to play saying this isn\u2019t acceptable and demanding more from our country and fellow citizens.\u201d\nThe fencing community has long drawn from elite universities with progressive-minded students. Columbia University, which won its 16th national championship in March, has been rated among the most liberal colleges in the country. Other schools in fencing\u2019s top 12 included Harvard, Yale, Duke, Princeton, Penn, Northwestern and Stanford, none of which would be likely to have a majority of students voting for Donald Trump.\nImboden is one of the exceptions who did not pass through college fencing at an elite or large state university, but there\u2019s a catch. He was set to fence at St John\u2019s but decided against it rather than give up income from his modeling career.\nThe US fencing community has benefited from racial diversity, starting with the breakthrough of Peter Westbrook, the son of an African American father and Japanese mother living in housing projects, who won bronze in men\u2019s saber at the 1984 Olympics.\nWestbrook has since started a foundation, based in the fencing hotbed of New York, which has produced plenty of collegians and Olympians. One of those fencers, Ibtihaj Muhammad, is the first American to participate in the Olympics while wearing a hijab despite reporting some institutional resistance along the way.\n\u201cThe Peter Westbrook Foundation does great work bringing fencing and the benefits of athletics to underserved communities, and athletes like Ibtihaj Muhammad, and many PWF athletes before her, are changing people\u2019s conception of what fencers look like and who the sport includes,\u201d says Ward, who competed at Duke a few years after Muhammad.\nThe diversity effort helped to invigorate USA Fencing and propel the country from also-ran status to perennial medal contender. Westbrook\u2019s bronze in 1984 was the only medal US fencers earned between 1960, when Albie Axelrod won bronze, and 2004, when Mariel Zagunis won gold and Sada Jacobson won bronze in women\u2019s saber. In 2008, Zagunis, Jacobson and Ward swept the women\u2019s saber individual medals and took team bronze.\nAlso in 2008, the US men\u2019s saber team broke through on the strength of a couple of Westbrook-educated fencers \u2013 Keeth Smart and Tim Morehouse. Smart\u2019s sister, Erinn, took silver in team foil to round out the USA\u2019s total of six medals in Beijing. Two more Westbrook fencers, both African American, medaled in 2016 \u2013 Muhammad in the team saber and Daryl Homer in the individual saber.\nMorehouse went on to start his own outreach program, Fencing in the Schools. And Smart, who got the US team to the 2008 final with two last-ditch rallies, was impressed with Imboden\u2019s gesture. \u201cRace is a friend and very intelligent person who also happens to be an incredible athlete,\u201d Smart says. \u201cI am not surprised by his action as he is very thoughtful and caring based on his experiences growing up in Brooklyn.\u201d\nBut Ward warns that the sport still has institutional barriers. \u201cDiversity does not necessarily equal inclusion, and with an extremely high-cost and subjective sport controlled by a small set of coaches, there is much more work to be done to ensure new athletes are welcomed and supported,\u201d Ward says.", "label": 0}, "text-706": {"text": "Global climate emergency: Which issues should we focus on next?\nAt the Guardian, we believe the climate emergency is the defining and most urgent issue of our time, and we know it\u2019s the issue our readers feel most passionately about.\nCovering the climate crisis is a priority for all our editors and in the last month, we have published the Polluters project \u2013 an in-depth investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures behind it \u2013 which has gained much attention from readers and news organisations around the world.

Reconstructions that suggest every next year is hotter than the last the world over. Except that Jaco Vlok began with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s temperature datasets without first undertaking adequate quality assurance (QA).\nRemember the infamous Climategate emails, and in particular the \u2018Harry read me files\u2019? Harry, working at the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia,\u00a0wrote:\nGetting seriously fed up with the state of the Australian data. so many new stations have been introduced, so many false references \u2026 so many changes that aren\u2019t documented. Every time a cloud forms I\u2019m presented with a bewildering selection of similar-sounding sites, some with references, some with WMO codes, and some with both. And if I look up the station metadata with one of the local references, chances are the WMO code will be wrong (another station will have it) and the latitude/longitude will be wrong too.\nFor years, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has been capitalizing on the mess that by its very nature throws up \u2018discontinuities\u2019 that can subsequently be \u2018homogenized\u2019 \u2026 so Blair Trewin is obliged to apply algorithms, to ensure every reconstruction shows steadily rising temperatures in accordance with theory.\nAs Christopher Booker explained some years ago:\nWhat is tragically evident from the Harry Read Me file is the picture it gives of the CRU scientists hopelessly at sea with the complex computer programmes they had devised to contort their data in the approved direction, more than once expressing their own desperation at how difficult it was to get the desired results.\nIn short, Phil Jones at the Climatic Research Unit in the UK, Gavin Schmidt at GISS NASA in New York, and even David Jones at the Australian Bureau in Melbourne have overseen the reworking of climate data until it fits the theory of catastrophic anthropogenic climate change (AGW).\nThey have, in fact, become the masters of Wiener\u2019s Law, without actually knowing the first thing about AI.\nThey have overseen the use of algorithms \u2013 independently of the checks and balances routinely applied in the mainstream AI community \u2013 to recreate past temperatures.\u00a0 In the process the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the temperature extremes of the late 1930s, so evident in the raw data for both Australia and also the US, have been removed from our historical temperature records. Thus, we have the Paris Accord, and a federal election in Australia where both candidates for future Prime Minister are committed to saving the environment from rising temperatures even if it means ruining the economy.\nThe history of science would suggest that disproving a failed paradigm is always more difficult than replacing one, and so I have thought beginning afresh with the latest AI techniques had merit.\u00a0\u00a0 But this work is only likely to succeed if the Australian raw temperature database \u2013 known as ADAM \u2013 is reworked from the beginning.\u00a0 Otherwise artificial warming from both the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and also the Bureau\u2019s new electronic probes in Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), that record hotter for the same weather, will keep creating hockey sticks as inescapably as Groundhog day.\nWhile artificial intelligence, and in particular ANNs, are now considered a mature technology used for a variety of tasks that require pattern recognition and decision making and forecasting \u2013 their capacity is denied by mainstream climate scientists.\u00a0 One of the reasons is that leading climate scientists claim the natural climate cycles have been so perturbed by carbon dioxide that the patterns no longer persist.\u00a0 This is of course little more than a hypothesis, which can be tested using ANNs as a research tool.\nIt has been my experience that the raw measurements of any variable associated with weather and climate, when arranged chronologically, show a pattern of recurring cycles.\nThese oscillations may not be symmetrical, but they will tend to channel between an upper and lower boundary \u2013 over and over again.\u00a0Indeed, they can be decomposed into a few distinct sine waves of varying phase, amplitude and periodicity.\u00a0 It could be the case that they represent actual physical phenomena, which drive continuous climate change.\nIf this is the case,\u00a0it may be possible to forecast the climate including temperature, wind speed and direction and even rainfall, by understanding its component parts. \u00a0As long as the relationships embedded in the complex oscillation continue into the future, a skilful weather and climate forecast is theoretically mathematically possible using ANNs\u00a0\u2013\u00a0despite chaos theory.\nSkilful weather and climate forecasts using ANN represent a new application for an existing technology.\u00a0 Indeed, if only a fraction of the resources spent applying this technology to mining social media data for advertising, could be diverted to the goal of better climate forecasting I\u2019m sure more major advances would be made very quickly. \u00a0But in the case of Australia, the databases will first need to be reworked to install some integrity.\nIn particular, every time there is a significant equipment change (for example, a change from a mercury thermometer to an electronic probe in an automatic weather station) then that temperature series needs to be given a new ID.\u00a0 In this way the ANN has some hope of finding the real patterns in climate change from the artificial warming embedded with the new equipment \u2026 or the growth of a city.\nInnovation, while usually technological, often has a real political implication.\u00a0 For example, with the invention of the printing press in the 1430s, suddenly there was an efficient way of replicating knowledge \u2013 it became harder to control the information available to the masses.\nSince the printing press, there have been many other inventions that have dramatically improved our quality of life including the invention of the steam engine in 1712, the telephone in 1876, penicillin in 1928 and personal computing as recently as the 1970s.\u00a0 Today more people are living longer, healthier and more connected lives thanks to these and other innovations.\u00a0 But when we consider the history of any single invention we find that it rarely emerged easily: there was initially confusion, followed by resistance.\nThe history of innovation (and science) would suggest that only when there is opportunity for competition do new and superior technologies take hold.\u00a0 Of course, this does not bode well for the adoption of AI for weather and climate forecasting by meteorological agencies because they are government-funded monopolies.\u00a0Furthermore, they are wedded to general circulation modelling that is a completely different technique \u2013 based on simulation modelling and next year being hotter than the last.\nTo be clear, there is the added complication that simulation modelling is integral to demonstrating anthropogenic global warming, while ANN rely exclusively on assumptions about the continued existence of natural climate cycles.\u00a0 To reiterate, it has been said that because elevated levels of carbon dioxide have perturbed weather systems, ANNs will not work into the future because the climate is on a new trajectory.\u00a0Conversely, if ANN can produce skilful climate forecasts then arguably anthropogenic climate change is not as big an issue as some claim. \u00a0Clearly, as with the printing press, there are political consequences that would follow the widespread adoption of AI in climate science for historical temperature reconstructions and also weather and climate forecasting. \u00a0I\u2019m hoping this could begin with more funding for the important work of Jaco Vlok \u2013 but perhaps not at the University of Tasmania or with Australian temperature data.\nThe new report by Jaco Vlok \u2018Temperature Reconstruction Methods\u2019 can be downloaded here, and my explanation of its importance and limitations \u2018New Methods for Remodelling Historical Temperatures: Admirable Beginnings Using AI\u2019 can be downloaded here.\nThe feature image (at the very top) shows Jaco Vlok (left) then Jennifer Marohasy, John Abbot and JC Olivier.\n**********",

climate change? And if world demand for coal wasn\u2019t declining, would we still want to stop the Adani coalmine being built? After 30 years of democratic failures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the last five we\u2019ve witnessed technological leaps succeed where elections could not. But what does it say about Australia if we are only willing to save ourselves, and our kids, if we can get a good deal on the price of renewables?\nImagine if the Australian and UK governments declined to participate in the war in Iraq because the price of bombs was a bit high. Imagine if the US waited for the price of nuclear missiles to fall before participating in an arms race with Russia. Or imagine if we criticised people for spending more on their cars, clothes or food than was \u201cnecessary\u201d.\nThe idea that we need to weigh the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the benefits of doing so is so widespread in Australia that it\u2019s difficult to see how absurd \u2013 and uncommon \u2013 such an approach is. While economics textbooks suggest that we should solve all problems in such a manner, the simple fact is we solve almost no problems that way. Take cars for example.\nCars are a very expensive way to move around a city. The private costs of buying, fuelling and maintaining a car are relatively high, and then there are the social costs. Without massive public investment in roads, tunnels and bridges, cars are virtually worthless. And then there are the costs of noise pollution, air pollution and congestion that car drivers impose on other citizens.\nCars do not provide anything close to \u201cleast cost transport\u201d, and the fact that most people who buy cars don\u2019t simply buy the cheapest available car makes a mockery of textbook economic descriptions of rational decision making. But strangely, I have never heard the oil industry demand that countries pursue least cost transport policy. Indeed, I\u2019ve never seen a car company determined to only sell the cheapest possible cars.\nImagine if the airline industry pursued \u201cleast cost travel\u201d. No more high prices, high-margin business class seats. That would be irrational and inefficient. Let\u2019s just pack people in the plane three high, coffin-style, and feed them with tubes. It\u2019s not hard to see why the airline industry doesn\u2019t push harder for all this least cost, economically efficient stuff that we keep hearing is so important when it comes to electricity.\nIf we wanted to reduce emissions, we could. And if we wanted Australian industries to have cheap gas, they would have it\nAustralians spend far more on superannuation fees each year than they do on electricity. In fact, the average Australian household spends more on coffee and takeaway but, for reasons that make no sense to me, we are told that we must minimise the cost of producing electricity, and that to do otherwise would be economically inefficient or harmful to Australia\u2019s competitiveness.\nIs Australians\u2019 desire to spend billions of dollars per year on bottled water harmful to the economy? Or our desire to drive large 4WD vehicles around in our crowded cities? Or our fascination with ripping out perfectly good bathrooms and replacing them with slightly different ones? Why is it \u201cgood for the economy\u201d for people to spend $100,000 on a big car, but \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d to spend $20,000 on a big solar array?\n\u201cBut what about the competitiveness of our manufacturing industry?\u201d I hear the Twitter trolls ask. \u201cWhy should we drive up the cost of energy for Australian manufacturing?\u201d Why indeed!\nLeaving aside that it was the Abbott government that scrapped assistance to the car industry and (successfully) taunted them into leaving our shores, the biggest threat to our manufacturing industry\u2019s energy costs comes from the decision by the gas industry to spend $70bn building three gas export facilities, right next to each other in Gladstone, Queensland. The whole point of that enormously expensive exercise was to lift the domestic gas price from the $3 per gigajoule it once was to the $11 per gigajoule it is today.\nMany of the same business and political groups that say we need to ignore climate change in order to keep energy prices low, enthusiastically support the fact that we now export huge amounts of gas at high prices rather than supply it to local manufacturers at low prices. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re having a laugh when they talk about competitiveness.\nAustralia is one of the richest countries in the world. Many Australians seem to be too rich to care about the fact they pay the big banks much higher interest rates than they could get at a credit union or building society. We seem to be too rich to care that we pay more to download Australian music from iTunes than a US citizen pays for the same song. And millions of Australians think that spending $10 per litre for bottled water is part of their \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d. How good is Australia?\nBut when it comes to avoiding dangerous climate change, we get told again and again that we need to watch our pennies and focus on \u201cleast cost abatement\u201d. Apparently our Defence Department can afford 12 new submarines to replace the six we never used and our treasurer believes we can afford to give away $300bn worth of tax cuts \u2013 but we can\u2019t afford to invest heavily in renewable energy. Yeah, right.\nI know, I know \u2013 I\u2019m falling into the \u201ctrap\u201d of accepting that there is a trade-off between the economy and the environment. And yes, I know that renewables are cheaper than coal and that building renewables will push energy prices down, not up.\nBut I don\u2019t care.\nI know that it\u2019s cheap to tackle climate change, but I\u2019d be willing to do so even if it was expensive. The fact that it is cheap isn\u2019t the reason to do it. Offal is cheap, and I haven\u2019t eaten it in 40 years.\nAustralia\u2019s national income is about the same size as Russia\u2019s, a country that can afford one of the world\u2019s largest military forces. We don\u2019t have a fleet of nuclear submarines, but we do have one of the lowest tax rates in the developed world. If we wanted to reduce emissions, we could. And if we wanted Australian industries to have cheap gas, they would have it.\nBut we don\u2019t. Our elected governments want to subsidise new coalmines and coal-fired power stations, and they don\u2019t ever claim that doing so will be \u201cefficient\u201d or \u201cleast cost\u201d. They just want to do it, so they do. It\u2019s only progressives that fall for the least cost claptrap.\n\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute", "label": 0}, "text-709": {"text": "Labor has to shame the Coalition into action on climate change\nThis week was a pretty big one for climate change, the drought and the ALP, and they were all somewhat intertwined.\nOn Wednesday an article published in the journal BioScience, co-signed by 11,000 scientists, warned \u201cclearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency\u201d.\nThe authors noted that, despite 40 years of solid scientific research pointing to the dangers of climate change, \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions are still rapidly rising, with increasingly damaging effects on the Earth\u2019s climate\u201d, and that \u201can immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.\u201d\nThis of course is pretty horrific news but at least there was some good news here in Australia, because the next day, for the first time ever, the national energy market produced more than half of its electricity via renewable sources.\nOf course no one in the government thought it worthy of celebrating or even mentioning \u2013 mostly because it happened in spite of the government\u2019s policies, not because of them.\nAnd it is possible to come up with effective national, bipartisan policy on climate change.\nWe saw it this week when on Thursday  New Zealand passed legislation committing the nation to achieving zero net carbon emission by 2050.\nThat same day our Department of Agriculture released a report into droughts by the coordinator-general for drought, Major General Stephen Day. It was pretty upfront about what is happening.\nThe fourth paragraph of the forward stated: \u201cAs a consequence of climate change, drought is likely to be longer and more severe in some regions and over broader areas. It means that farmers and communities in some regions are likely to see drought more often\u201d.\nAnd just in case you needed it underlined, it continued: \u201cultimately, the nation could see some areas of Australia become more marginal and/or unproductive\u201d.\nThat very same day (it really was a busy Thursday) the prime minister and the leader of the Nationals released the government\u2019s drought package. At no stage during the press conference was climate change raised once. That was despite Day\u2019s report finding \u201cclimate change, and the increased frequency and severity of drought in some regions, is considered the most serious threat to land management\u201d.\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAnd just to top it all off, also released that same day was the ALP\u2019s review into its election loss, in which the politics of climate-change policy was given a very strong focus.\nThis in effect is politics in Australia \u2013 the LNP is at best expected to pretend to look like it cares, while receiving barely any heat for doing nothing, while the ALP is expected to actually come up with a real policy and at the same time receive all the heat for attempting to do something.\nLast week Katharine Murphy and Adam Morton revealed the government had quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with a climate change policy that will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nIt would be nice to have some hope that this might actually lead to a policy that does something substantial, but watching LNP climate change policy over the past 30 years forces one to assume the result will be a policy that looks like the government is doing something while in reality it is just another lie that somehow greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without any economic pain to anyone.\nMeanwhile the ALP report noted that the Coalition sought to \u201cassert Labor\u2019s climate change policy was not costed\u201d. And that \u201cLabor\u2019s inability to respond effectively played into the Coalition\u2019s characterisation of Labor as a risk\u201d.\nThis is true to an extent. The assertion that it was not costed was false, but the reality was the media in large parts fell for the Liberal party line. And the reason they fell for it was an underlying assumption that we could (nay, should!) somehow compare the costs of a 45% cut in emissions as recommended by scientists with the cost of a 24% cut in emissions which once carryover credits were included was really closer to a 15% cut.\nIt meant that the ALP needed (and as the report noted, largely failed) to \u201ceffectively discuss the cost of not acting on climate change.\u201d\nThis is hard enough to do alone, it is nigh on impossible when few in the media are bothering to challenge the LNP with those costs as well.\nInstead we remain trapped in a cycle where we find yet another drought assistance package presented all the while the government\u2019s own documents state climate change will cause more of them.\nAnd it means we\u2019re trapped in a cycle where effectively promising to keep doing the short-term response indefinitely is viewed as a long-term policy.\nMurphy was right to note that the crucial element of the ALP\u2019s review is squaring the often countervailing forces of traditional blue-collar workers and wealthier inner-city-dwelling progressives.\nThe answer is not to put up the white flag on climate change, and the report makes that clear, noting: \u201ca modern Labor party cannot deny or neglect human-induced climate change. To do so would be wrong, it would cause enormous internal instability and it would be a massive electoral liability\u201d.\nIt also notes the need to focus on the employment and economic positives of the change.\nThis is absolutely a must.\nThe transition to zero emissions will be tough \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t we would already have done it. But it needs to be enticing, exciting and desired.\nThe US Democratic party has its Green New Deal, and the UK Labour under Corbyn has very much linked the switch to renewables with jobs.\nIt really is a no-brainer for Australia to be a world leader in renewable production and technology.\nAnthony Albanese has rightly set off on this path \u2013 his speech in Perth a week ago made this a key issue. But it will need more than just a few speeches. It is going to need a policy and a campaign that inspires people, because that is what great progressive policy does.\nAnd as with other progressive policies such as Medicare it also shames the conservatives into supporting it.\nThis will be tough because, as we have long seen, the conservatives in this country have no shame when it comes to ignoring climate change. But it needs to be done.\n\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia", "label": 0}, "text-710": {"text": "England's vile and disturbing night in Sofia will live long in sporting infamy\nWelcome to the new world. We came expecting a football match. What we got was a miserable occasion on a miserable night in a miserable stadium against miserable opposition played out to a miserable backdrop of recrimination and bad blood.\nBy the end this did not feel like a sporting event at all. It felt like an open sore, an affront to the basic idea of nations coming together to exchange flags, in a stadium transformed into a well of poison.\nEngland\u2019s players were racially abused by sections of the home crowd throughout. There were Nazi salutes in the stands, this in a nation that was an ally of the Third Reich within living memory.\nIn the middle of which there were also strange, grisly little details. As England walked off at half-time Bulgaria\u2019s captain, Ivelin Popov, could be seen leaning into fencing to appeal to the home fans to stop the racist chanting that threatened to curtail this sorry spectacle.\nAs a statement threatening to abandon the match was read out over the PA a woman in the home section laughed and made mock thumbs-down gestures, as though this was all a rave, a lark, a pantomime.\nAn hour after the final whistle, just as Greg Clarke, the chairman of the FA, had talked about, among other things, England\u2019s backroom staff being deeply upset by events on the pitch, Bulgarian journalists could be seen laughing and joking, greeting this horror show not with shame or remorse, but as though it was, at worst, an inconvenience.\nThe statement from Bulgaria\u2019s manager, Krasimir Balakov, that he had not noticed anything, that he just wanted to talk about football, was an anatomy of cowardly dissembling. Balakov had a responsibility to his sport and to basic human decency. He failed on both counts.\nSomehow England played brilliantly in the middle of all this, a game that fell apart around them at times and against opponents who barely played at all. Who knows, perhaps this might come to seem like a righteous occasion.\nRacist abuse in football stadiums has been a source of unhappiness for as long as there has been racist abuse and football stadiums. There was at least some sense of action being taken in the enforcement of the under-enforced Uefa protocols at the fag end of so many inadequate fines and decisive measures never put in place. By the end, the spectacle of England playing on felt, rightly or wrongly, like a kind of resistance.\nA kind of history was made as for the first time football made a live intervention. The half\u2011time break was the third stoppage of the game. The first came just after England\u2019s second goal. As the England end celebrated the sounds of joy and exhilaration were replaced by chants of \u201cYou racist bastards, you know what you are\u201d. Provocative perhaps but also prescient and entirely accurate. The first monkey chants from the home crowd were heard shortly after.\nThey were directed at Tyrone Mings, who took the ball by the touchline and was greeted by a small group of Bulgarians making the hated, hateful noises. Mings made his pass then turned and stared at the crowd. In that moment your heart broke slightly. Here was a man on his England debut, fielding with the utmost grace and composure not just vile abuse but a moment that will echo far beyond this shabby\u2011looking pitch.\nMoments later, Gareth Southgate could be seen talking to the Uefa official Danilo Filacchione, pointing over at the far side where the noise had come from. Filacchione spoke into his walkie-talkie. The game paused. And so we waited. Finally, the PA announcement came, a thin, anxious, hectoring voice that drew boos and shrieks from the home crowd.\n\u201cBecause of racist behaviour among spectators which is interfering with the game the referee has indicated he may have to suspend the match.\n\u201cPlease be under no mistake the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if the racist behaviour continues.\u201d\nWe crawled on, horribly. At 40 minutes there was more of the same as Mings took the ball. A three-way discussion followed between manager, referee and Filacchione. There were whistles, jeers, objects thrown from the ultras in black at the far end close to the Bulgaria goal.\nEngland shuffled together protectively. Finally, they walked back out to restart when they might have chosen to walk off, a decision that drew boos and whistles from the home crowd. Six minutes of stoppage time for racism, the board flashed up.\nThere was time for more abuse and time also for another goal as Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane (playing a wonderful hand as a creator in the middle of all this poison) set up Raheem Sterling for 4-0.\nThe second half felt like a wake, and not just for the idea of the game as a competitive exercise, as England scored six and might have had 10.\nBulgaria had played like a rabble. Their fans had disgraced their country and deeply embarrassed (it is to be hoped) their president, Boris Mikhailov. Presumably his apologies will be just as heartfelt as his complaints on Friday that Tammy Abraham had been wide of the mark in assuming all this would indeed come to pass in Bulgaria\u2019s national stadium.\nWill England ever want to come here again? Before kick-off their fans had filled their corner-slice of this sallow concrete bowl with the usual travelling pageantry of St George\u2019s flags. The rest of the stadium was a half-empty husk. No great hardship shutting parts of this ground: the end opposite the banned area remained a sea of empty seats.\nThere will be a reckoning for the Bulgarian Football Association. Perhaps the protocols will now be used more often. What is a protocol anyway? A mode of behaviour, an attempt to civilise. What protocol did we see here? It isn\u2019t enough. For now, no other European nation should be asked to play in Sofia. Lock the gates. Let the plastic seating moulder, the concrete crack.\nYet, beyond this, the idea Uefa can realistically staunch this kind of performative racist protest is laughable. These Bulgarians were not having a moment or allowing their usual high standards to slip. They were gleefully taking the opportunity to abuse black footballers and to demonstrate in some cases that they are fascists.\nOne thing is certain: the England team can be hugely proud of their grace under pressure. There was something majestic about those red shirts, still abused periodically but determined to see this through. Football carried on.

The failure of cashflow is the single biggest cause of small business closure and consequent loss of employment,\u201d the group said.\n\u201cGiven the flow-on effects, assistance to small businesses impacted by Covid-19 must seek to underpin cashflow so that businesses continue to remain viable and retain staff in the face of any dramatic falls in revenue.\u201d\nThe group is calling for direct cash grants, tax breaks, wage assistance and regional stimulus.\nThe Australian Tourism Industry Council is also pushing the government for immediate financial support for affected businesses, and extra funding for Tourism Australia to spend on promoting domestic tourism.\nFollowing the release of the December quarter figures, the Oxford Economics chief economist, Sarah Hunter, said the 0.5% growth recorded for the three months to the end of December was better than expected \u2013 but it was likely that there would be no growth, or a shrinking economy, recorded for the first three months of the year.\nShe said the coronavirus outbreak increased the chance of a recession \u2013 two or more consecutive quarters in which the economy shrinks.\n\u201cPre all of this, at the end of last year, I would have said the chance of a recession is very, very low,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut now obviously everything is changing and we\u2019re only just getting some data points through to get an idea of the size of the shock.\u201d\nShe said the \u201cbest case\u201d for the first three months of the year was zero growth in gross domestic product.\n\u201cI think though we could easily see a contraction in the economy, in economic activity, just based on the hit to services ... the tourism channel of course and the business channel.\n\u201cAs we go through March we\u2019re going to see more and more of the supply chain issues coming through.\u201d\nSpending on retail and eating out would also fall, she said.\n\u201cAnd also, not to forget, it does get lost at the moment, the bushfires.

He says drawing attention to climate crisis and emissions reduction policies during the bushfire season is an attempt to \u201cscore [political] points\u201d during a disaster.\nHe says the government is considering calls to pay volunteer firefighters but notes that is \u201cin the first instance\u201d a matter for state governments.\nMorrison says calls to reduce carbon emissions are \u201creckless\u201d and that Australia doesn\u2019t need to do more on tackling climate crisis. He rejects calls from the opposition to bring forward a meeting with state governments to address the bushfire crisis.\nMorrison agrees to compensation payments made to NSW volunteer firefighters who have lost income due to fighting bushfires, but he sees no further role for the commonwealth. \u201cWe\u2019re there to help the states and territories as they address these crises. The states are the ones, as premier knows all too well, who are directly responsible for the funding of their fire services and all the other things that are done.\u201d\nA third NSW RFS volunteer, Samuel McPaul, is killed when his truck rolls during extreme conditions at a fire near Jingellic, on the NSW/Victoria border.\nMorrison releases a statement through social media offering condolences to McPaul\u2019s relatives and emphasising the leading role of the state and territory firefighting authorities in the bushfire crisis. He says the commonwealth will continue in its role of providing \u201csupport\u201d to those efforts.\nMorrison shares his new year message urging Australians to celebrate living \u201cin the most amazing country on earth\u201d and remember \u201cthere\u2019s no better place to raise kids anywhere on the planet\u201d. He does not make any connection between the bushfires and global heating, suggesting that Australians had faced similarly terrible ordeals throughout history.\nLater that day, Morrison hosts the annual New Year\u2019s Day Cricket Australia-McGrath Foundation reception with the Australian and New Zealand teams at Kirribilli in Sydney. In his address to the teams, he says forthcoming Sydney Test match will be \u201cplayed out against terrible events\u201d but that \u201cat the same time Australians will be gathered whether it\u2019s at the SCG or around television sets all around the country and they\u2019ll be inspired by the great feats of our cricketers from both sides of the Tasman and I think they\u2019ll be encouraged by the spirit shown by Australians\u201d.\nAt a press conference, Morrison says he\u2019s \u201calways acknowledged the link \u2026 between the broader issues of global climate change and what that means for the world\u2019s weather and the dryness of conditions in many places\u201d but that \u201cno response by any one government anywhere in the world can be linked to any one fire event\u201d.\nMorrison reiterates he has no plans to change Australia\u2019s emissions reduction policy. He defends his government\u2019s response to the fires by saying he doesn\u2019t want state and federal governments \u201cto be tripping over each other in order to somehow outbid each other in the response\u201d.\nNavy ships and army aircraft are dispatched to help fight bushfires in Victoria.\nWhile initially saying it was \u201cstill the plan\u201d to go to India later in January for trade and defence talks, at which Australia\u2019s coal exports were expected to feature heavily, Morrison says only hours later that he is \u201cinclined not to proceed\u201d with the visit, which has now been postponed.\nThe army reserve is called in to assist with firefighting efforts.\nMorrison says the federal government will agree to a request made 18 months ago to permanently increase funding to Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting capacity.\nThe prime minister\u2019s office releases an ad spruiking its firefighting efforts, backed by a jaunty jingle.\nWe\u2019re putting more Defence Force boots on the ground, more planes in the sky, more ships to sea, and more trucks to roll in to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery as part of our co-ordinated response to these terrible #bushfires pic.twitter.com/UiOeYB2jnv", "label": 0}, "text-713": {"text": "Fossil fuel production on track for double the safe climate limit\nThe world\u2019s nations are on track to produce more than twice as much coal, oil and gas as can be burned in 2030 while restricting rise in the global temperature to 1.5C, analysis shows.\nThe report is the first to compare countries\u2019 stated plans for fossil fuel extraction with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which is to keep global heating well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5C. It exposes a huge gap, with fossil fuel production in 2030 heading for 50% more than is consistent with 2C, and 120% more than that for 1.5C.\nScientists have warned that even the difference between 1.5C and 2C of heating will expose hundreds of millions of people to significantly higher risks of extreme heatwaves, drought, floods and poverty.\nThe report was produced by the UN Environment Programme and a coalition of research organisations. It complements an earlier UN analysis showing the current Paris agreement pledges to cut emissions would still lead to a catastrophic 3-4C rise.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a deep hole \u2013 and we need to stop digging,\u201d said M\u00e5ns Nilsson, executive director of the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), which was part of the analysis. \u201cDespite more than two decades of climate policymaking, fossil fuel production levels are higher than ever.\u201d\nMost action to tackle the climate crisis involves reducing emissions, but Inger Andersen, head of the UN Environment Programme, said a focus on fossil fuel production was long overdue. Most of the action pledges made by countries under the Paris deal do not even mention changes to production.\nThe UK is a \u201cstriking\u201d example of this mismatch, said Cleo Verkuijl, at the SEI\u2019s centre in Oxford, UK. It was the first major economy to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, she said, but also subsidises fossil fuel production at home and abroad and intends to extract \u201cevery drop of oil and gas\u201d from its North Sea fields. In recent years, the UK oil and gas industry has received \u00a3176m more annually in government support than it paid in taxes, the report said.\nThe Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:\n\u2022 Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.\n\u2022 Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.\n\u2022 Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u00a0 \n\u2022 Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier.\n\u2022 A fifth of all farmland \u2013 15% of the UK \u2013 being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes.\n\u2022 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.\n\u2022 Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. \nThe UK Oil and Gas Authority said in a statement: \u201cOil and gas will remain an important part of our energy mix for the foreseeable future, including under net zero scenarios. Maximising the economic recovery from the UK remains vital to meet those energy demands as long as they exist, and to reduce reliance on imports.\u201d\nThe report\u2019s warning was strongly backed by senior figures. \u201cEnsuring a liveable planet for future generations means getting serious about phasing out coal, oil and gas,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, at Mission 2020 and is the person who delivered the Paris agreement in 2015 as the UN\u2019s top climate official. \u201cCountries such as Costa Rica, Spain and New Zealand are already showing the way forward, with policies to constrain exploration and extraction \u2013 others must now follow their lead. There is no time to waste.\u201d\nProf Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cThis important report shows planned levels of coal, oil and gas production are dangerously out of step with the goals of the Paris agreement.\u201d\nThe report highlights the nations that are taking some action, including the closure of most coal mines in Spain and some in China, along with the end of new offshore oil and gas exploration licences in New Zealand and some parts of the Arctic governed by Canada, the US and Norway.\nVerkuijl said a global agreement to phase out production would be ideal but is difficult at present with the US under President Donald Trump, as the country is due to withdraw from the Paris agreement. But she said many Democratic presidential candidates have promised to cut fossil fuel production by restricting extraction on public land, for example, or removing subsidies. She said such a candidate beating Trump in the 2020 election would be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d.\nThe report said it was crucial that workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new employment as production ramped down. \u201cLeaders need to [talk with] workers and their unions to plan a just transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d said Sharan Burrow, head of the International Trade Union Confederation.\nThe analysis is based on the published national plans of eight key producers: Australia, Canada, Russia, US, China, India, Indonesia and Norway, which account for 60% of global fossil fuel production. The plans of other big producers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not publicly available. The researchers assumed these and other producers would maintain a similar share of global production to today at around 40%.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2019 to clarify the description of the methodology. The researchers did not assume that producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran would follow \u201csimilar paths\u201d as the eight countries that were covered, but that those producers would maintain a similar share of global production as the eight countries that were covered.", "label": 0}, "text-714": {"text": "Iran's deputy health minister: I have coronavirus\nIran\u2019s deputy health minister said he has contracted the coronavirus and placed himself in isolation, a day after appearing feverish at a press conference in which he downplayed its spread in the shrine city of Qom and said mass quarantines were unnecessary.\nIraj Harirchi posted a video on social media on Tuesday acknowledging he had caught the virus, which appears to be taking rapid hold in parts of Iran.

The fourth of an eight-point checklist informed them they would not be allowed to take ham or any pork product, \u201ceven if it is vacuum packed\u201d. A couple of days later one Barcelona fan told the radio show El Larguero that he would be doing so anyway but not many will defy the rules \u2013 if only because not many will travel at all.\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid have sold 50 tickets, according to one fans\u2019 group. El Mundo calculated that Valencia have sold 27, Barcelona around 300 and Madrid almost 700, although most of those are to people who happened to be near the King Abdullah Sports City stadium in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the competition is being held. When it comes to supporters travelling specifically for the games, it said there were fewer than 200, paying upwards of \u00a32,000, and \u2013 according to AS \u2013 as few as 40 Madrid fans making the journey for the semi-final. Of the tickets the clubs had available they have sold less than 10%, although most have not been sold at all. They have been given away.\nBarcelona v Atl\u00e9tico is sold out, with the Spanish football federation (RFEF) proudly announcing a day before kick-off that there are \u201conly\u201d 10,000 tickets left for Valencia v Madrid. \u201cExcitement is through the roof in Jeddah,\u201d the RFEF communiqu\u00e9 claimed. In Spain, it is a different matter.\nIt is not hard to guess what it was that attracted the RFEF to the fabulously wealthy absolute monarchy of Saudi Arabia, signing a three-year deal worth \u20ac40m (\u00a334m) a year, half of which goes to the participating clubs, and that decision has met criticism from many sides, focusing on everything from format to human rights.\nFor a start Luis Rubiales is the RFEF president who blocked La Liga\u2019s attempts to take a game per season to the US, only to take three games to Saudi Arabia, just as he took last season\u2019s one-off Super Cup to Morocco. He insists the Super Cup is different \u2013 which in terms of competition integrity, it is \u2013 and claims the competition, traditionally played between the cup and league winners over two legs in August, was dying. The new final-four format, moved to January and opened up to include the next two highest finishers in the league, has largely if not unanimously been welcomed. But little else convinces.\nValencia insisted that as cup winners they should automatically play the final and threatened legal action over the fact that they were due to receive \u20ac3m, compared with the \u20ac8m each promised to Madrid, Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico. The money was adjusted to \u20ac6m for Barcelona and Madrid, \u20ac3m for Atl\u00e9tico and \u20ac2m for Valencia, with a further \u20ac1m for each of the finalists. Happily for the organisers the draw set up a potential cl\u00e1sico in the final.\nThe league, which is at loggerheads with the federation, questioned the choice of Saudi Arabia, which it accuses of being at the heart of systematic state\u2011sponsored piracy of the TV signal for Spanish games. Saudi Arabia has denied this.\nOther reservations are more profound. Few Spaniards are going to Saudi Arabia; until recently, even fewer seemed likely to watch it on television after the state broadcaster, TVE, refused to bid for the rights, arguing it did not want to contribute to the whitewashing of the regime. At the start of December it was announced that Movistar would show the games.\nAmnesty International sent an open letter to the RFEF alerting it to human rights violations, \u201cincluding discrimination against women, freedom of speech restrictions \u2026 extensive use of the death penalty and torture of prisoners\u201d. In September the Spanish education minister, Isabel Cela\u00e1, questioned the suitability of Saudi Arabia, citing gender equality concerns, a position supported by the minister for sport. An El Pa\u00eds editorial described taking the Super Cup to Saudi Arabia as making sport an \u201cinstrument of tyranny and obscurantism\u201d, the female footballer Vero Boquete calling it a \u201cstab in the back\u201d. In El Mundo Orfeo Su\u00e1rez wrote: \u201cIf the woman is Spanish and a footballer, we run to her defence. If she\u2019s Arabic and anonymous, we look at our current account.\u201d\nUefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, had advised its 55 members not to play games in places where women\u2019s access to stadiums is restricted and \u201cbasic rights\u201d are not respected but the federation insisted this was different: that rather than block football being played there, they would use this competition to open doors. Rubiales claimed the money made would be handed to the women\u2019s game and even called this \u201cthe Super Cup of equality\u201d. He insisted: \u201cWe had a chance to help. We\u2019re going to be a tool of social change that benefits men and women.\u201d Women will be allowed into the stadiums and, unlike in the Italian Super Cup also played there, in all areas of the ground, not segregated by sex.\n\u201cWe\u2019re different to 10 years ago,\u201d the Saudi minister of sports, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki, told reporters from the RFEF\u2019s Las Rozas HQ. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about politics; I talk only about sport,\u201d he said, as if they were not intertwined, as this competition has shown. \u201cI hope Spanish women buy tickets and enjoy the Supercopa.\u201d\nBut hardly any Spaniards are buying tickets at all, let alone likely to enjoy it.", "label": 0}, "text-717": {"text": "Sports quiz of the week: Rugby World Cup, cars, cuts and players going nuts", "label": 0}, "text-718": {"text": "Australian bushfire crisis: global figures and media react to 'climate emergency'\nPoliticians and climate change activists around the globe have expressed horror at the unfolding Australian bushfire crisis, saying the devastation is an urgent reminder of the climate emergency.\nFormer US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said the fires \u2013 which began during Australia\u2019s hottest ever year \u2013 left no room to question the effects of climate change.\n\u201cWith Australia on fire and the Arctic in meltdown, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re in a climate emergency,\u201d Clinton said, going on to detail her support for the Earthshot prize, described by Sir David Attenborough as \u201cthe most prestigious environment prize in history\u201d.\nBernie Sanders, in the race to become the Democrats\u2019 US presidential nominee, said the scenes in Australia would become \u201cincreasingly common around the world\u201d and issued a call to action.\n\u201cWhat is happening in Australia today will become increasingly common around the world if we do not aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.

The greatest prize this summer has been the wonderfully named Clifden nonpareil \u2013 literally meaning \u201cbeyond compare\u201d.\nOne of our largest and most spectacular moths, with a 12cm wingspan and a bright blue flash on its underwings, it was once considered extinct in Britain. Yet this summer, after an absence of many years, the Clifden nonpareil has been turning up in moth traps all over southern England and Wales.\nIts day-flying counterpart, the hummingbird hawkmoth, has also had a good year, as has one of our most mysterious and sought-after species, the death\u2019s-head hawkmoth.\nMade famous \u2013 or perhaps that should be infamous \u2013 by the novel and film The Silence of the Lambs, several death\u2019s-head caterpillars and pupae have been found in potato patches in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip.\nBrought indoors by local naturalists, they were successfully hatched out, the adult moths revealing the sinister skull pattern on the back of the thorax that gives the species its name. When I went to see this extraordinary insect, it emitted its famous \u201csqueak\u201d, which adds to its terrifying reputation.\nIt\u2019s not just these new arrivals that indicate the effects of climate change \u2013 or as we now more correctly call it, the climate emergency. Many resident bird species are rising in numbers; as are short-distance migrants such as the blackcap and chiffchaff. These small, neat warblers are now overwintering in Britain (instead of Spain and north Africa), thanks to milder winters, and the consequent wider availability of their insect food.\nSo, in Voltaire\u2019s ironic comment, all is surely for the best, in the best of all possible worlds. For the moment, that may indeed be true. Yet as long ago as 1990, the German ornithologist and migration expert Peter Berthold warned that during the initial warming period many bird species would benefit from \u201cheavenly conditions\u201d. This, he explained, was a kind of honeymoon period in which warmer springs and summers, and milder winters, would allow them to expand their numbers and range.\nBut if the global climate becomes hotter still, with more frequent and extreme weather events such as droughts, storms and floods, reality will inevitably begin to bite, and all but the most adaptable species will start to decline. Their fall might also be hastened by an increase in populations of parasites and diseases, which flourish in warmer climates.\nIronically, the long-tailed blue butterfly I watched sunning itself in August cannot survive Britain\u2019s winters \u2013 at least not yet. As Neil Hulme explains, it would need a rise in average temperatures of several degrees, enough to banish winter frosts that kill their larvae, to colonise Britain permanently. But if that did happen, we would have reached a climatic tipping point, and probably lose not just much of our wildlife, but even jeopardise our own long-term existence on the planet.\nRapid environmental change is likely to hit some creatures harder than others. On a recent edition of the Radio 4 series The Life Scientific, Professor Anne Magurran of St Andrews University talked about what she calls \u201cthe shopping mall effect\u201d. She noted that wherever you go in the world nowadays, from London to Los Angeles, Madrid to Melbourne, shopping centres tend to have the same outlets \u2013 well-known international brands whose names we all recognise.\nLikewise, in response to a panoply of environmental pressures, ecosystems are tending to become more homogenous, with a few highly adaptable species beginning to dominate to the exclusion of less successful ones. As Magurran warns, if environmental conditions become more and more extreme, homogenisation will start to occur, and there will inevitably be species loss.\nHowever, as Magurran points out, there is still time for us to take action to help safeguard the earth\u2019s biodiversity. At the moment, she says, the dominant signal is change rather than loss. But unless we take swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change, while at the same time preventing habitat destruction, the rate of extinction will start to accelerate. Given that many governments appear to be heading in the opposite direction, with increased deregulation and a weakening of environmental protection back on the agenda, this is a very real concern. If we fail to act, the consequences for Britain\u2019s wildlife are that successful generalists will do well, while specialists will not.\nWhen it comes to making predictions, we also need to take into account the unusual nature of the British Isles, which stretch from Shetland, just a few degrees of latitude short of the Arctic Circle, to Scilly, which has its own \u2013 almost subtropical \u2013 microclimate.\nSo, while we enjoy the short-term benefits of climate change in the south, problems are already beginning to occur at the other end of Britain. On the Cairngorm plateau, our sole example of the arctic-alpine biome, the ptarmigan \u2013 the only British bird that turns white in winter \u2013 is gradually declining, with just a few thousand pairs remaining.\nUntil the start of the 19th century, the ptarmigan could be found across a wide swathe of northern Britain, south to the Lake District; but today it survives only in the Highlands. Its decline has been caused by a number of factors, including crows attracted by the rubbish left by visitors, which prey on the ptarmigan\u2019s eggs and chicks. But a more long-term factor is the warming climate, which is altering the habitat and food supply of these highly specialised birds.\nShould the climate emergency continue to worsen, and temperatures keep rising, the ptarmigan \u2013 along with other highland specialists such as the dotterel and snow bunting \u2013 looks set to disappear as a British bird in my lifetime.\nI recall many years ago hearing someone talk about saving the planet \u201cfor our children, and our children\u2019s children\u201d. At the time, this felt like an abstract notion; even a rather sanctimonious platitude. Now that I have children and step-grandchildren of my own, who may well live to witness the 22nd century, that phrase feels far more relevant and urgent. If the worst predictions for the climate emergency come true, with devastating consequences for human and animal life on this planet, then I do not envy them living that long.\nSo, much as I enjoy seeing cattle egrets on my local patch, or catching up with a new species of butterfly on the south coast, my pleasure is more than ever tinged with concern.\nMy fear is that these pioneering colonists are not something to be celebrated, but a phenomenon to warn us of impending disaster in this new age of extinction.\n\u2022 Stephen Moss is a naturalist and author based in Somerset, where he is president of the Somerset Wildlife Trust; he also runs an MA in travel and nature writing at Bath Spa University", "label": 0}, "text-720": {"text": "Australia's fossil fuel industry should pay climate disaster levy, thinktank says\nAustralia\u2019s fossil fuel industry would stump up for a national climate disaster fund levy to help cover the costs of escalating natural disasters, under a new thinktank proposal.\nThe Australia Institute has released a plan to have some of the nation\u2019s biggest polluters pay a $1 levy per tonne of carbon pollution from fossil fuel production, which it estimates would raise at least $1.5bn per year.\nPutting the nation back together again after flood, storm or fire is an increasingly costly exercise, as climate change exacerbates the strength and duration of events, draining local, state and federal coffers.\nMark Ogge, the principal adviser at The Australia Institute, said with costs only forecast to increase, the nation needed to look at new ways to cover them, while also holding fossil fuel producers responsible.\n\u201cThe frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as bushfires and floods will keep increasing while we keep pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAustralia urgently needs a dedicated, independently administered fund to cope with the ever-increasing costs of these disasters.

Low prices might diminish the intensity, but GOP voters will still want America to be energy independent regardless of oil prices.\u201d\nOn February 12, Politico held a gathering called \u201cCaucus Energy South Carolina\u201d that featured several of the SC \u201cinsiders\u201d among whom the host said are \u201cinfluential voices,\u201d who offer \u201ckeen insight into what\u2019s going on on the ground.\u201d\nThere,\u00a0Mike McKenna, who has consulted a wide variety of political and corporate clients with respect to government relations, opinion research, marketing, message development and communications strategies, and who has served as an external relations specialist at the U.S. Department of Energy, declared: \u201cEnergy is a second tier issue. Climate change is fifth tier. Nobody cares about it. It is always at the bottom.\u201d\nThe climate change agenda has been the most expensive and extensive public relations campaign in the history of the world. Gallup has been polling on this issue for 25 years. Despite the herculean effort,\u00a0fewer people are worried\u00a0about climate change today than 25 years ago. Pew Research Center has repeatedly found that when given a list of concerns regarding the\u00a0public\u2019s policy priorities, respondents put jobs and economy at the top of the list, with climate change at the bottom.\u00a0Polling\u00a0done just before the UN climate conference in Paris, found that only 3% of Americans believe that climate change is the most important issue facing America.\nEven Democrat Jane Kleeb, an outspoken opponent of the Keystone pipeline, acknowledged that climate change, as an issue, doesn\u2019t move people to act.\nDavid Wilkins, a former U.S. Ambassador to Canada who has worked on issues such as energy, national security, and the environment, said that voters are \u201cnot going to let the environment trump the economy.\u201d He believes there will be a reapplication for the Keystone pipeline and that eventually it will be built. Another insider, Democrat Inez Tenenbaum, disagreed, saying: \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to be energy dependent.\u201d To which Wilkins quipped: \u201cAll the more reason to get oil from our friends.\u201d\nWhen it comes to energy, there are clearly differences between the parties, but strangely both agree that climate change isn\u2019t \u201ca major issue for voters.\u201d\nBut don\u2019t tell Steyer\u2014or Senator Bernie Sanders. Steyer has praised Sanders for his public stand on climate change saying that he\u2019s brought it up \u201crepeatedly,\u201d calling it a \u201cnational security issue\u201d and \u201cthe number one issue facing Americans\u201d\u2014despite the fact that polling indicates otherwise.\nAs if he were channeling Steyer, in his New Hampshire victory speech, Sanders\u00a0declared: \u201cWe will not allow back into the White House a political party \u2026 that cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe debate is over. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating problems in this country and around the world. We have a moral responsibility to work with countries throughout the world to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\u201d\nSince nobody cares about climate change in the 2016 presidential campaign, except for Sanders and influential Democrat billionaire donor Steyer (who stands to gain financially from his advocacy), unfortunately one can easily guess where a chunk of his millions will go.

The scandal should have ended climate catastrophism. Instead, it was studiously buried by politicians, scientists, activists, and crony capitalists, raking in trillions of dollars from the exaggerations and fakery while exempting themselves from the damage they are inflicting on other people.\nFew people know the inconvenient facts about the supposed manmade climate crisis. For example, since 1998, average global temperatures have risen by a mere few hundredths of a degree. For a time, they even declined slightly. Yet all we hear is fearmongering about manmade carbon dioxide causing global warming and climate changes that pose existential threats to humanity, wildlife, and the planet. Based on this, we are told we must stop using fossil fuels to improve living standards. This is bad news for Africa and the rest of the developing world.\nWe keep hearing rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels cause rising global temperatures, but satellite data show no such thing. Computer model predictions for 2019 are almost a half degree Celsius (0.9 degrees F) above actual satellite measurements. Yet, whenever a scientist raises questions about the alleged crisis, he or she is denounced as a \u201cclimate change denier.\u201d\nA major source of data supporting the human-caused carbon-dioxide-induced warming proposition came from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.\nOn the morning of November 17, 2009, a Pandora\u2019s box of embarrassing CRU information exploded onto the world scene. A hacker penetrated the university\u2019s computer system and took 61 megabytes of material showing the CRU and outside scientists it worked with had been manipulating scientific information to make global warming appear to be the fault of mankind, particularly industrial carbon dioxide. Among many other scandals, the leaked emails showed then-CRU-director Prof. Phil Jones boasting of using statistical \u201ctricks\u201d to remove evidence of observed declines in global temperatures.\nIn another email, Jones advocated deleting data rather than providing it to scientists who did not share his view and might criticize his analyses. Non-alarmist scientists had to invoke British freedom of information laws to get the data. Jones was later suspended, and former British Chancellor Lord Lawson called for a government enquiry into the embarrassing expos\u00e9.\nThe affair became known as Climategate. A group of American University students even posted a YouTube song, \u201cHide the Decline,\u201d mocking the CRU and climate modeler Dr. Michael Mann, whose use of the phrase \u201chide the decline\u201d in regard to temperatures had been found in the hacked emails.\nSince California became a state, the measured global rise in atmospheric temperature has been less than 1.0 degrees Celsius, with much of this increase occurring prior to 1940. Average planetary temperatures fell from around 1943 until about 1978, leading to a global cooling scare. Temperatures rose slightly until 1998, then mostly remained stable, even as carbon dioxide levels continued to rise. Changes in carbon dioxide levels and temperature variations do not correlate very well.\nDuring the well-documented Medieval Warm Period (MWP) from about 950 to 1350 A.D., warmer global temperatures allowed Vikings to raise crops and tend cattle in Greenland. The equally well documented 500-year Little Ice Age (LIA) starved and froze the Vikings out of Greenland, before reaching its coldest point, the Maunder Minimum of 1645 through 1715, when England\u2019s River Thames regularly froze over, Norwegian farmers demanded compensation for lands buried by advancing glaciers, and priests performed exorcism rituals to keep alpine glaciers away from villages. Paintings from the era show crowds of people ice skating and driving horse-drawn carriages on the Thames.\nIndustry and automobile emissions obviously played no role in either the MWP or the LIA.\nThese dramatic events should ring warning bells for any competent, honest scientist. If the Medieval Warm Period occurred without industrial carbon-dioxide emissions driving it, why should industrial carbon dioxide be causing any observed warming today? Europe\u2019s great plague wiped out nearly a quarter of its population during the Little Ice Age. The warm period brought prosperity and record crops, whereas cold years brought misery, famine, and death.\nTen years before Climategate, Mann released a computer-generated graph purporting to show global temperatures over the past 1,500 years. His graph mysteriously made MWP, LIA, and Maunder extreme cold years disappear, and it showed planetary temperatures spiking suddenly in the last couple decades of twentieth century. The graph had the shape of a hockey stick, was published worldwide, and became a centerpiece for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nMany scientists were highly suspicious of the hockey stick claims. Two of them, Steven McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, completely discredited the computer program Mann used to generate the hockey stick\u2019s revisionist history. That did not stop former U.S. vice president Al Gore from using the discredited graph in his doom-and-gloom climate change movie An Inconvenient Truth.\nThe hacked CRU emails also showed exchanges in which Mann and Jones discussed how to intimidate editors who wanted to publish scientific views contrary to theirs, to suppress any contradictory studies. In one email, Jones expressed his desire to get rid of the \u201ctroublesome editor\u201d of the journal Climate Research for daring to publish differing views. The editor was sacked.\nWhen University of Colorado Professor Roger Pielke Jr. asked CRU for its original temperature readings, he was told the data had been lost. Lost! Do professionals lose something as valuable as original data? Many observers suspected the Climategate perpetrators just didn\u2019t want anyone to expose their clever manipulations and fabrications.\nPossibly worse, when Climategate broke, \u201cclimate justice\u201d campaigner for Friends of the Earth Emma Brindal said bluntly, \u201cA climate change response must have at its heart a redistribution of wealth and resources.\u201d Not protecting Earth from manmade carbon-dioxide emissions or natural and manmade climate change, but redistributing wealth and resources, presumably according to formulas self-appointed ruling elites like herself decide are \u201csocially just.\u201d\nClimate campaigners oppose building modern homes for Africans, with some even saying Africans must continue living in mud huts and avoid the use of electricity and modern farming technologies. Actor Ed Begley has said, \u201cAfricans should have solar power where they need it most: on their huts.\u201d These activists and their opinion leaders such as Al Gore, Phil Jones, and Mike Mann are exempted from these restrictions, of course.\nReal social justice and human rights mean everyone has access to abundant, affordable, and reliable energy, especially electricity, and not from expensive, weather-dependent wind turbines and solar panels, but from fossil fuel, hydroelectric, and nuclear power plants.\nWe in the developing world will no longer let the climate delusion promoted by loud, radical activists put the brakes on African economic development, jobs, and improved health and living standards.\n\u2014\u00a0Guest essayist Kelvin Kemm, Ph.D., is a nuclear physicist and CEO of Nuclear Africa.\nSOURCES: Climate Etc.; Economics\nIN THIS ISSUE \u2026\nPolar bear increase threatens climate icon status \u2026 WMO head breaks with climate crisis narrative\nPODCAST OF THE WEEK\nDebunking the Hockey Stick, Part Two (Guest: Steve McIntyre)\nSteve McIntyre, founder and editor of the blog dedicated to analysis of climate data Climate Audit, discusses with Heartland Senior Fellow Anthony Watts how he first became interested in climate discussion.

Stossel produced a fantastic piece on the event that debunks the alarmist claims of environmentalists.\nPOLAR BEAR INCREASE THREATENS CLIMATE ICON STATUS\nZoologist and top polar bear researcher Susan Crockford, Ph.D., was let go by the University of Victoria, where she had taught for 15 years, even though her research showing polar bear populations were thriving despite purported climate change has been proven correct. Crockford says the university bowed to \u201coutside pressure\u201d in deciding not to renew her contract.\nCrockford is one of the most widely cited researchers on polar bear biology and the threats to their populations. Her research challenged climate alarmists\u2019 assertions that polar bears are being threatened with extinction due to climate change, claims which were based on limited or no data and instead relied on computer model projections and speculative assumptions about the relationship between polar bears and sea ice. Crockford\u2019s research showed polar bear populations were largely healthy, with bears finding plenty of food and having good numbers of babies. Their population is at record highs, which has been measured scientifically. Crockford also explained why polar bears were thriving and, at least for the foreseeable future, should be expected to continue to flourish.\n\u201cWhen push came to shove, UVic threw me under the bus rather than stand up for my academic freedom,\u201d the Washington Times reports Crockford as saying about the University\u2019s decision not to renew her contract.\nThe university\u2019s display of cowardice comes as other research confirms Crockford is right about the health of polar bear populations, forcing climate delusion hucksters to seek out a new charismatic species as the poster child for the alleged dangers of climate change to wildlife.\nCourt documents filed by native Inuit groups, the people living in closest proximity to and most often interacting with polar bears, show climate change is not having much of an impact on them.\n\u201cInuit have not noticed a significant decline in the health of the polar bears,\u201d the Toronto Sun reports a court affidavit submitted by the director of wildlife management for the Nunavik Marine Region Wildlife Board saying. \u201cIn fact Nunavik Inuit report that it is rare to see a skinny bear and most bears are observed to be healthy, [and Nunavut residents have seen an] increase in the polar bear population and a particularly notable increase since the 1980s.\u201d\nThe court case involves a federal lawsuit filed by Inuits to overturn a decision by Environment Canada to reduce hunting quotas for polar bears. Evidently bowing to pressure from outside climate activist groups and international bureaucrats, Environment Canada reduced the number of polar bears native peoples could take this year, despite an unrefuted report from its own Wildlife Board stating \u201cAll interviews conducted in the Southern Hudson Bay communities shared the view the population grew somewhat from the 1960s until the 1980s, and that a continued increase has been very noticeable since that time.\u201d\nPolar bear populations are so healthy they aren\u2019t listed as threatened or endangered by the federal panel monitoring Canadian wildlife under the Species At Risk Act, which notes their numbers have increased, not declined, in recent decades.\nSOURCE: Toronto Sun; The American Mirror; Washington Times\nA lead scientist working closely with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recently come out against the most alarming climate claims being made by other scientists and pushed by the mainstream media.\nIn a recent interview in the Finnish financial newspaper Talouselama (\u201cThe Journal\u201d), Petteri Taalas, Ph.D., secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), says climate change is happening, but it doesn\u2019t mean the end of the world or that people must stop having children or give up modernity. Taalas says doomsday climate scenarios are not justified by the science, and scientists and climate activist groups, such as Extinction Rebellion, pushing them and demanding people live like religious ascetics, resemble religious zealots.\n\u201cThe IPCC reports are read like the Holy Book, where certain sentences are sought to justify their own extreme positions. It has the features of religious extremism,\u201d said Taalas. \u201cExperts are under attack for not being radical enough. There are threats and extremists in all corners of the world.\u201d\nIn a separate statement on the WMO\u2019s website, Taalas says \u201cthe science-based approach is undermined when facts are taken out of context to justify extreme measures in the name of climate action. Action should be based on a balanced view of the science available to us and not on a biased reading of reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, of which WMO is one of the parent organizations.\u201d\n\u201cThis world will not end. \u2026 The living conditions of some people on the planet are getting harder, but people have been living under difficult conditions for a while,\u201d Taalas said in Talouselama.\nTaalas says there is no justification for demanding an end to fossil fuel use in the short term, because it would bring about unnecessary hardships. In most respects, people around the world are better off now than they\u2019ve ever been, Taalas says.\n\u201cIf we look at the state of the world, excluding climate change and population growth, then we are at the best of mankind\u2019s time in many ways: the economy, health and, for example, the position of women will never be better,\u201d Taalas said.\nSOURCES: CO2 Coalition; World Meteorological Organization", "label": 1}, "text-723": {"text": "Much has been written about the admission by alarmist scientists that the temperature increases have not gone to plan.

Coal and gas are 70 per cent.\nRenewable energy and people\u2019s willingness to pay for it\nMany surveys point to people wanting government action on climate change. Last week, an Australian poll had three quarters of people supporting a cleaner climate.  A recent US survey showed that most Americans favor policies that would help the country lower its emissions.  But such surveys have different outcomes if respondants are asked to pay the costs.  Thus in the recent US survey, half the respondants were unwilling to pay even one dollar, and only 18 percent are willing to pay at least $100 per month.\nIn that respect, Ronald Bailey asks \u201cHow much are we willing to spend in order to make those living in 2100, who will likely be at least nine times richer than us today, $2,000 better off?\u201d Not much is the answer.\nTo ensure costs are more accurately accounted for, the US Energy Department is seeking to ensure wind pays for the costs it imposes on reliability; the Department points out, \u201cWholesale electricity prices vary from day to day and reflect a power plant\u2019s marginal cost of generating energy. That means wind and solar power have a distinct advantage over fossil fuels since it costs them virtually nothing to produce an extra unit of power.\u201d\nAustralian energy policy and developments\nUnder pressure to reverse its stated intent of closing its Liddell coal generator, champion subsidy farmer, AGL, now has alternative plans to disconnect customers and build a massive battery; it claims this would provide \u201cfirm\u201d power of 150 MW \u2013 perhaps a tenth of that from its neglected Liddell ($) plant.

Let\u2019s hope 2020 is the year sanity makes a comeback. There have long been three groups occupying the climate issue. To avoid pejoratives, I will call them A, B and C.\n\nThe A group are the doubters. They don\u2019t believe greenhouse gases (GHGs) do much harm and they don\u2019t support expensive climate-policy interventions. If we must choose between climate policy and the continued use of inexpensive fossil energy, they readily choose the latter.\n\nThe C group think the opposite; they fear a climate catastrophe, they foresee a crisis, and they want urgent action, regardless of cost, to stop it.\n\nThe B group are in the middle. They believe, or say they believe, that GHG emissions are a problem and must be reduced. They are vague on the question of how much and when, but in general they try to balance environmental goals with the provision of inexpensive energy and robust economic growth. The leaders in business, government and the bureaucracy tend to be in this group. They have spent the last 20 years verbally acknowledging the concerns of group C, and even borrowing their slogans, while quietly letting the A agenda mostly win out, which the underlying economics pretty much necessitates. This uneasy compromise fell apart last year.\n\nDespite A being a more natural ally for B, the B group long ago marginalized the A crowd and instead tried to ingratiate themselves with the Cs. They funded them, welcomed the more congenial elements into their circles, and adopted their rhetoric about sustainability, the low-carbon transition and the imperative for climate leadership. To the B crowd these were just nice-sounding sentiments; a bit of green window-dressing to help sell the growth agenda. But their new friends in the C crowd meant every word.\n\nThanks to 20 years of patronage and endorsement from the B crowd, group C is now in control and has dropped any pretense of commonality with B. They raised a generation convinced the apocalypse is nigh, and they proved over the past year they can dictate terms of surrender to politicians everywhere. To take one example, the decision by the European Investment Bank to phase-out all investments in fossil fuel projects\u2014even natural gas\u2014by 2022, and redirect a trillion euros into \u201cclimate action and environmental sustainability\u201d is a clear signal that the Cs are not only at the table, they run the show. Likewise, the worldwide declarations of a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and the embrace of net-zero targets means the B group is officially sidelined, at least in the west.\n\nThe exception among developed countries is the United States, where the Bs long ago recognized the true aspirations of the Cs and aligned themselves with the A crowd, realizing in the process that it\u2019s a surprisingly large and energetic constituency, thus creating a coalition capable of keeping the U.S. energy sector alive and the economy growing. Other exceptions include the developing powerhouses of China, Russia (who both must relish the prospect of their democratic western rivals abandoning world economic and energy leadership for climate\u2019s sake) and India.\n\nTo those in the B group who are bewildered by the turn of events, I say this\u2014you must win this fight, and right now you are losing badly. At stake are the livelihoods of millions of ordinary people whose jobs and living standards will be destroyed if C prevails, not to mention the hopes of billions of people who want to rise out of poverty.\n\nThe old compromise is dead. Stop using C jargon in your speeches. Start learning the deep details of the science and economics instead of letting the C crowd dictate what you\u2019re allowed to think or say. Figure out a new way of talking about the climate issue based on what you actually believe. Learn to make the case for Canada\u2019s economy to survive and grow. You, and by extension everyone who depends on your leadership, face an existential threat. It was 20 years in the making, so dig in for a 20-year battle to turn it around. Stop demonizing potential allies in the A camp; you need all the help you can get.\n\nClimate and energy policy has fallen into the hands of a worldwide movement that openly declares its extremism.

Setting a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is vital, but her government\u2019s plans are too little too late.\nYes, Britain may be the first G7 country to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, but others have shown greater ambition. Finland committed to be carbon-neutral by 2035, Norway has a 2030 target and eight EU countries have asked for all members of the bloc to commit to net-zero by 2050 and dedicate a quarter of the EU\u2019s next budget to projects fighting climate change. Britain wasn\u2019t among them.\nWhat really matters is action, not words. For all her claims of leadership on climate, May\u2019s record in office has been pitiful: support for fracking (against the wishes of local communities), blocking onshore wind (the cheapest renewable energy source) and displaying unlimited enthusiasm for new roads and runways.\nAs a result, it\u2019s not surprising that the government\u2019s official adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has repeatedly warned that the UK is not on track to meet its near-term carbon targets in the 2020s and 2030s.\nLegislation will only deliver what\u2019s intended if it is watertight, and this law falls well short. For example, there was no mention of aviation or shipping in the government\u2019s announcement, and it\u2019s not clear if they will be included. Yet aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of UK emissions, doubling since 1990.\nMoreover, there is a very clear \u201cget-out\u201d clause after five years, giving the UK the option of abandoning the target if other countries are not taking similarly ambitious action. The justification for this is that UK industries would face unfair competition if others continued with their carbon emissions.\nThis is wrong on two counts. It undermines business certainty, which will affect long-term investment decisions. And it fails to give the spur to the UK\u2019s low-carbon sector. The CBI has already said some sectors will need clear pathways to enable investment in low-carbon technologies. This law doesn\u2019t provide them.\nBut the more egregious loophole is the decision to retain the ability to use international carbon credits to offset Britain\u2019s emissions. This goes directly against the recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change, which said only last month that it was \u201cessential that the commitment [to net-zero] was comprehensive [and] achieved without use of international credits\u201d.\nUsing international credits allows Britain to carry on emitting greenhouse gases while offsetting those emissions by planting trees in other countries or helping pay for low-carbon energy projects. These things need to happen but they should not be instead of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, they should be in addition.\nThe UK cannot claim credit by grabbing the low-hanging fruit of easy wins in the global south, particularly when it slows the rate of decarbonisation in Britain. If we are really serious about net-zero emissions, they must not be achieved with dodgy loopholes and cynical greenwash.\nI am also left with the suspicion that, for all the declarations of a climate emergency, the government\u2019s approach is still incremental, based on making green-tinged tweaks to business as usual, in the vain hope that we will somehow creep towards our target of net-zero.\nWe won\u2019t. A carbon-free economy must deliver climate justice, focus on deindustrialised communities, provide good quality jobs for workers up and down the country, and support the global south.

Fearing he had picked up Covid-19 in South Africa and infected all his fellow travellers, the guards sent everyone to a hastily built quarantine centre for 14 days.\nThe man had died of other causes but Malawi, which is well used to devastating diseases like HIV and Aids, cholera and malaria, is taking no chances. Along with S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Comoros, South Sudan and Burundi in Africa, it is one of the last countries in the world not to have confirmed a single Covid-19 case yet.\nIn Malawi only 20 people a day can be tested for the virus, and there are just 25 intensive care unit beds and seven ventilators in the country of more than 18 million people. Since February, however, the government has been racing to curb Covid\u2019s arrival.\nIt has wheeled out a \u00a324m preparedness plan, suspended international flights, banned weddings and gatherings of more than 100 people, closed schools and universities, and is making anyone arriving from Europe, China, or the US self-isolate. According to the ministry of health, 4,603 people who have entered the country in the past few weeks are \u201cunder surveillance\u201d.\nAs an extra precaution, Malawi\u2019s president, Peter Mutharika, has reduced the number of people he meets to 10-20 a day.\n\u201cWe have been told to regularly wash hands using soap or alcohol sanitiser. But because there have been no confirmed cases, people are not yet too frightened. Business is going on as usual, people are still making huge gatherings at some places like markets,\u201d says Blantyre accountant James Gomani.\nWhile warnings about Covid-19 are widely heard in jingles and public health announcements in cities like Blantyre and Lilongwe, they have barely reached the remote rural areas where nearly 90% of Malawi\u2019s population live and farm, and few people have access to TV, radio or electricity, says Patrick Kamzitu, a heath worker in Nambuma.\nIf Covid-19 gets in, it will spread rapidly across the country and many people will die. The health system is very weak\n\u201cWe fear that it will come. If it does, it will overwhelm us, and be worse than cholera, which we had badly in 2013, and hunger in 2002. People will die in large numbers,\u201d he says.\nKamzitu cycles from village to village warning of what may come and telling people to take precautions, but rural health centres have few drugs. Many people don\u2019t even have soap or running water and are already weakened with malaria, HIV or tuberculosis.\nMalawi has plenty of experience of handling contagious diseases but is barely prepared for a disease that can spread so fast, says Oxfam\u2019s international head of inequality policy, Max Lawson, a former resident of Malawi who is now based in Nairobi.\n\u201cIf Covid-19 gets in, it will spread rapidly across the country and many people will die. The health system is very weak and poorly resourced. The population is young, which may be in Malawi\u2019s favour with a disease like Covid-19, but there is a lot of untested TB and HIV in the country.\n\u201cThe UK government and other donors have not been supporting Malawi like they used to. They should immediately suspend the country\u2019s debt payments. It would cost very little and help a lot. As it is, Malawi will be hit very badly economically by Covid-19.\u201d\nHealth professionals fear it is only a matter of time before the pandemic reaches Malawi. \u201cIt has only been in the past few weeks that it has been spreading across Africa. So most people feel it will get here at some point. We may not be 100% ready but government is gearing up,\u201d says Dr Bridget Malewezi of the Society of Medical Doctors.\nAfrica has confirmed only 6,473 cases, many of which were brought into the continent by people working in China or Italy. But the numbers of confirmed cases have quadrupled in the past week, and South Africa has started to identify internal infections. There has been little testing outside economic centres like South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt. \nJoyce Banda, the former Malawi president, this week accused the government of hiding the real figures. On her official Facebook site she said Malawi needed to be transparent in order to access international disaster relief funds. \u201cThe global community cannot assist us when we are hiding our statistics and our challenges to fight the pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere is some reason to hope Africa will be able to avoid the extreme level of disruption that affected east Asia and Europe. The experience of Ebola has taught important lessons about engaging communities in dealing with infectious diseases. And many African governments are well ahead of the curve in introducing restrictive measures,\u201d said Nick Westcott, director of the Royal African Society in London, in a blogpost. \nSince the publication of this article, the Guardian has learned that the government of Malawi has confirmed the first three cases of coronavirus in the country.", "label": 0}, "text-727": {"text": "We need to protect nature to stand any chance of tackling climate chaos\nIt has been heartening to see how the climate emergency has finally risen up the political agenda in recent months. What has had much less attention, but is equally urgent, is the catastrophic decline in our nature and wildlife. The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, and the situation is getting worse. A 2019 report into the state of British nature paints a bleak picture: nearly half the species assessed showed strong or moderate decline over the last decade; 15% of the UK\u2019s wildlife species are threatened with extinction. Birds and animals that were familiar to our parents and grandparents, such as the curlew, water vole, adder or common toad, are now rare sights.\nWe have hundreds of wonderful conservation organisations in this country such as the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, Plantlife, the Marine Conservation Society and more. They do important work, aided by people\u2019s generosity and committed volunteers. But they have not been able to halt the precipitous decline in our wildlife. The Green party has always had the most ambitious policies on nature of any political party, with more than 70 such proposals in our current manifesto, from reducing pesticide use to repurposing our economy. But it is not enough to have strong policies: we need to be constantly challenged to go further. That is why, earlier this year, I commissioned a report from five of the leading conservationists and nature writers in Britain to produce a blueprint for how we ensure nature\u2019s survival. It is called A New Deal for Nature.\nIts proposals address individual, public and government action. They cover national parks, farming, biosecurity, the marine environment and more. They also focus on education: how to give children access to nature so that they recognise the natural world, grow to love it and feel the need to protect it. Among the recommendations are a GCSE in natural history (which I have championed for several years) and introducing an hour of outdoor learning every day in every primary school.\nWe are lucky to have a number of magnificent national parks in Britain, but they were originally founded to preserve landscape beauty and give public access to green space. There was no requirement to protect wildlife. That needs to change.\nNature reserves are often islands of biodiversity. If they are cut off from each other, there is little opportunity for wildlife populations to spread. They need connecting corridors to create a network throughout Britain \u2013 another of the report\u2019s recommendations. Most of us \u2013 83% \u2013 live in towns or cities. This has helped foster a sense that nature is what happens elsewhere, in the countryside, so we don\u2019t recognise wildlife in our own neighbourhood. Peregrine falcons can already be seen in some of our cities. More species could thrive if we helped; and creating greener, more biodiverse cities would improve our wellbeing too.\nThere are many ways to do this, beginning with casting off the obsession with tidiness in parks and gardens and making more wild areas. Also, some of our best wildlife areas are old industrial brownfield sites. The report suggests giving them \u201cpop-up\u201d status as sites of special scientific interest, and incentivising developers to leave derelict land for wildlife for 10-year periods.\nThe authors say their aim is to be radical, aspirational and inclusive \u2013 guided by the best science available. Some of their proposals are controversial and challenging. But we need to be pushed out of our comfort zone of weekend walks in the country, occasional visits to national parks, or curling up on the sofa in front of Countryfile \u2013 which give the impression that all is well. It isn\u2019t. I have said over the past few weeks that this general election is the climate election, but nature and the climate crisis are inextricably linked.

Nevertheless, the home secretary\u2019s insistence that the police always make decisions based on the \u201crisk to the public, security risks, security threats\u201d does inevitably lead to an obvious, unanswered question. If she is right, how exactly did Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE), which wrote and published the guide, manage to make what even it admits was a significant \u201cerror of judgment\u201d?\nThe answer lies in how alleged risks posed by protest groups are assessed. To begin with, it may surprise many that there is no legal definition of what \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d even means, leaving the police with complete discretion in deciding what it covers. \u201cExtremism\u201d and \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d are used interchangeably by the police to differentiate from terrorism. The current criteria is so broad and ambiguous that David Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, has described it as \u201cmanifestly deficient\u201d and last summer, the Home Office finally confirmed it had stopped using such terms. The police, as we have seen, have not.\nIn practice, decisions about who is labelled an \u201cextremist\u201d are made in secret by police units concerned more about their ideas of security and defending public order than about human rights and by officers who are often deeply antagonistic towards protesters challenging the corporate and political orthodoxies of the day.\nThe full extent of such hostility was set out in a Policy Exchange report on XR co-authored last year by Richard Walton, the former head of the Metropolitan police\u2019s counter-terrorism command. Walton claimed, extraordinarily, that what he saw as \u201cthe underlying extremism of the campaign\u201d had been \u201clargely obscured from public view by what many see as the fundamental legitimacy of their stated cause\u201d.\nIt is hardly surprising, therefore, that assessments of alleged \u201crisk\u201d are never neutral. Invariably, as the CTPSE guide claimed, just having an \u201canti-establishment philosophy\u201d, taking part in entirely non-violent direct action and even participation in \u201cplanned school walkouts\u201d is enough for the police to classify individual campaigners as a threat.\nIn turn, this classification provides police with the justification for intensive surveillance, which can be extremely intrusive and intimidating.\nXR is far from the first environmental campaign to receive this kind of police attention. More than a decade ago the anti-aviation group Plane Stupid was targeted and it is nine years since Mark Kennedy was exposed as an undercover police officer who infiltrated annual climate camp gatherings.\nHowever, the most recent targets have been opponents of fracking, with sustained surveillance from regional counter-terrorism units. Netpol, the organisation I run to monitor public order, protest and street policing, has documented the experiences of the anti-fracking movement for five years and these provide an important reminder of why no matter what promises are made now, there are no guarantees the police will stop categorising XR as \u201cextremists\u201d in the future.\nIn December 2016, negative media coverage forced the Home Office to declare that \u201csupport for anti-fracking is not an indicator of vulnerability\u201d to extremism. This followed reports about City of York council and a school in North Yorkshire including anti-fracking campaigns in their Prevent counter-terrorism advice. However, months later, leaked \u201ccounter-terrorism local profiles\u201d \u2013 again the work of the regional police unit in the south-east of England \u2013 identified protests in Sussex as a \u201cpriority theme ... where increased tensions or vulnerabilities may exist\u201d. \nAs recently as October 2019, there was evidence of Surrey county council claiming local police had advised it that anti-fracking activities were among their \u201cmain extremist areas of concern\u201d (alongside the far right) and that any protest, no matter how peaceful, was \u201cextremist\u201d.\nIt is clear that once the current controversy dies down, it will be only a matter of time before XR and other climate activists are again labelled as an \u201cextremist risk\u201d. The group has indicated it may bring legal action to have its name removed from any list but perhaps XR would be better served by putting its weight behind the call for the complete abolition of the \u201cdomestic extremist\u201d label for everyone.\nTo protect freedom to protest, the government also needs to completely separate secretive counter-terrorism units from the policing of non-violent protests. They have no business involving themselves in legitimate political activity.\nUntil this happens, it seems unlikely anyone will ever be held to account for \u201cerrors of judgment\u201d, no matter how potentially damaging the consequences are for those labelled a safeguarding risk. Officers will simply carry on, as they have for decades, trying to find imagined threats in any new and emerging protest movement and then spying on and disrupting their campaigns. It\u2019s time this finally stopped for good.\n\u2022 Kevin Blowe is coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring", "label": 0}, "text-729": {"text": "Why don\u2019t we treat the climate crisis with the same urgency as coronavirus?\nIt is a global emergency that has already killed on a mass scale and threatens to send millions more to early graves. As its effects spread, it could destabilise entire economies and overwhelm poorer countries lacking resources and infrastructure. But this is the climate crisis, not the coronavirus. Governments are not assembling emergency national plans and you\u2019re not getting push notifications transmitted to your phone breathlessly alerting you to dramatic twists and developments from South Korea to Italy.\nMore than 3,000 people have succumbed to coronavirus yet, according to the World Health Organization, air pollution alone \u2013 just one aspect of our central planetary crisis \u2013 kills seven million people every year. There have been no Cobra meetings for the climate crisis, no sombre prime ministerial statements detailing the emergency action being taken to reassure the public. In time, we\u2019ll overcome any coronavirus pandemic. With the climate crisis, we are already out of time, and are now left mitigating the inevitably disastrous consequences hurtling towards us.\nWhile coronavirus is understandably treated as an imminent danger, the climate crisis is still presented as an abstraction whose consequences are decades away. Unlike an illness, it is harder to visualise how climate breakdown will affect us each as individuals. Perhaps when unprecedented wildfires engulfed parts of the Arctic last summer there could have been an urgent conversation about how the climate crisis was fuelling extreme weather, yet there wasn\u2019t. In 2018, more than 60 million people suffered the consequences of extreme weather and climate change, including more than 1,600 who perished in Europe, Japan and the US because of heatwaves and wildfires. Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe were devastated by cyclone Idai, while hurricanes Florence and Michael inflicted $24bn (\u00a318.7bn) worth of damage on the US economy, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\nAs the recent Yorkshire floods illustrate, extreme weather \u2013 with its terrible human and economic costs \u2013 is ever more a fact of British life. Antarctic ice is melting more than six times faster than it was four decades ago and Greenland\u2019s ice sheet four times faster than previously thought. According to the UN, we have 10 years to prevent a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial temperature but, whatever happens, we will suffer.\nPandemics and the climate crisis may go hand in hand, too: research suggests that changing weather patterns may drive species to higher altitudes, potentially putting them in contact with diseases for which they have little immunity. \u201cIt\u2019s strange when people see the climate crisis as being in the future, compared to coronavirus, which we\u2019re facing now,\u201d says Friends of the Earth\u2019s co-executive director, Miriam Turner. \u201cIt might be something that feels far away when sitting in an office in central London, but the emergency footing of the climate crisis is being felt by hundreds of millions already.\u201d\nImagine, then, that we felt the same sense of emergency about the climate crisis as we do about coronavirus. What action would we take? As the New Economic Foundation\u2019s Alfie Stirling points out, a strict demarcation between the two crises in unwise. After all, coronavirus may trigger a global slowdown: the economic measures in response to this should be linked to solving the climate crisis. \u201cWhat tends to happen in a recession is policy-makers panic about what the low-lying fruits are; it\u2019s all supply chains and sticking plasters,\u201d he tells me. During the 2008 crash, for example, there was an immediate cut in VAT and interest rates, but investment spending wasn\u2019t hiked fast enough, and was then slashed in the name of austerity. According to NEF research, if the coalition government had funded additional zero-carbon infrastructure, it would not only have boosted the economy but could have reduced residential emissions by 30%. This time round, there\u2019s little room to cut already low interest rates or boost quantitative easing; green fiscal policy must be the priority.\nWhat would be mentioned in that solemn prime ministerial speech on the steps of No 10, broadcast live across TV networks? All homes and businesses would be insulated, creating jobs, cutting fuel poverty and reducing emissions. Electric car charging points would be installed across the country. Britain currently lacks the skills to transform the nation\u2019s infrastructure, for example replacing fuel pumps, says Stirling: an emergency training programme to train the workforce would be announced. \nA frequent flyer levy for regular, overwhelmingly affluent air passengers would be introduced. As Turner says, all government policies will now be seen through the prism of coronavirus. A similar climate lens should be applied, and permanently.\nThis would only be the start. Friends of the Earth calls for free bus travel for the under-30s, combined with urgent investment in the bus network. Renewable energy would be doubled, again producing new jobs, clean energy, and reducing deadly air pollution. The government would end all investments of taxpayers\u2019 money in fossil fuel infrastructure and launch a new tree-planting programme to double the size of forests in Britain, one of Europe\u2019s least densely forested nations.\nThere is a key difference between coronavirus and climate crisis, of course, and it is shame. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know coronavirus was coming,\u201d says Stirling. \u201cWe\u2019ve known the climate crisis was on the cards for 30 or 40 years.\u201d And yet \u2013 despite being inadequately prepared because of an underfunded, under-resourced NHS \u2013 the government can swiftly announce an emergency pandemic plan.\nCoronavirus poses many challenges and threats, but few opportunities. A judicious response to global heating would provide affordable transport, well-insulated homes, skilled green jobs and clean air. Urgent action to prevent a pandemic is of course necessary and pressing. But the climate crisis represents a far graver and deadlier existential threat, and yet the same sense of urgency is absent. Coronavirus shows it can be done \u2013 but it needs determination and willpower, which, when it comes to the future of our planet, are desperately lacking.\n\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "label": 0}, "text-730": {"text": "I\u2019ve never known a sport to be on a knife edge like rugby union is in Japan\nThere have been some wonderful stories in the first week of the World Cup and some fantastic rugby played but it is unfortunate that the leading topic is the high tackle and refereeing controversies that are dominating the agenda in Japan.\nWorld Rugby is not solely to blame, even if I disagree entirely with the decision to go public with a statement slamming the referees. The more I think about it the less I can see why that statement was released. I do not understand what the intention was, other than perhaps to appease the public. The team of officials was selected by World Rugby so I don\u2019t see why the governing body has not backed its team. If it needs to, do the autopsy after the tournament but do everything you can to alleviate the stress on them at this stage.\nTo dig deeper into the debate however, we need to look at various stakeholders: World Rugby, the referees, the players, the broadcasters and the media and supporters. Looking at World Rugby first, there is a huge disparity between what it has said in public and how matches are being refereed.\nI was in favour of World Rugby coming out with its clampdown on high tackles before the start of the tournament. The World Cup has been taken to Japan, there are more eyes on the game than ever before so it was an important statement to make. But it only works if those goals are aligned in practice with how the referees operate and it is clear that has not been the case in the opening matches.\nSo where does the responsibility lie? Some of the referees have just missed things. It happens, that\u2019s human error. There has never been a harder time to be a referee and we can\u2019t expect them to get every single decision right but they are under so much scrutiny. So many supporters have an in-depth knowledge of the laws nowadays. They can find clips of incidents, post them on social media and it is almost as if the citing takes place on Twitter first.\nI look to what Steve Hansen said before the New Zealand v South Africa game. He criticised Rassie Erasmus for trying to get into the ear of the referee and urged him to lay off because they have a hard enough job as it is. If Hansen is saying that even before the storm was whipped up, why on earth is World Rugby cranking up the pressure?\nAfter most rugby matches, the top international coaches will put their hands up and say that they themselves didn\u2019t quite get it right if their team underperforms. It\u2019s very rare that a coach will come out and say that the players just didn\u2019t perform. They may say it behind closed doors but not usually in public and that\u2019s what I felt World Rugby did.\nWith regards to the players, it is of course really tough for them, the game is speeding up, the ball is in play a little longer, players are getting tired and having to adapt techniques that have been drummed into them. That isn\u2019t an excuse, it is just the reality. The margin for error is incredibly small. Look at the Reece Hodge and Rey Lee-Lo incidents \u2013 chalk and cheese but the same outcome. I feel sorry for Hodge. It\u2019s a stone cold red card but he is chasing across, Peceli Yato is stepping really late and Hodge is having to adjust at the last second. Is there sympathy for Lee-Lo almost taking someone\u2019s head off? Or for John Quill on Owen Farrell? No. That was thuggish. We have to set a strong example that those techniques are no longer acceptable.\nPiers Francis has now been cited; it wasn\u2019t malicious \u2013 the adrenaline was pumping, he wanted to set his stall out. We\u2019re talking inches. If he hits him on the chest it\u2019s a yellow card but he struck him on the chin and he could well be going home. I\u2019ve never known a sport to be on such a knife edge.\n\u2022\u00a0Fixtures, tables and results\n\u2022 Top try and points scorers\n\u2022\u00a0Stadium guide\n\u2022\u00a0Referee guide\n\u2022 Our latest minute-by-minute live reports\n\u2022\u00a0Sign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter\nTeam guidesPool A: Ireland, Japan, Russia, Samoa, ScotlandPool B: Canada, Italy, Namibia, New Zealand, South AfricaPool C: Argentina, England, France, Tonga, USAPool D: Australia, Fiji, Georgia, Uruguay, Wales\nSo what are the solutions? With rugby we really led the way with TMOs. We\u2019ve seen things such as Hawk-Eye and Snickometer follow. A fluid game was made even better and sharper. You could hear the TMOs in commentary, you had the introduction of ref links but I feel like now it has gone back in time. We\u2019re not talking about the technology, we\u2019re talking about the referee\u2019s ability and I\u2019m not quite sure there is another sport where the referees are scrutinised as much. We have the technology but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s used as well as it could be.\nIt\u2019s so important that there is a consistency between what is being said, what is being refereed and on top of that how pundits and broadcasters are dealing with it too. We ask referees and TMOs to do their jobs and it\u2019s really important that we do our jobs as well. This is my first World Cup as a commentator. If I was working back home I would have a direct line to the TV director where I can call for replays, have a look at things and the TMO can hear our commentary. This World Cup is very different and that is unfortunately out of our control. It\u2019s not only referees and their assistants missing things, but TMOs as well. Directors need to be better at finding angles and replays for everyone to be able to help guide that decision-making process.\nUltimately, I believe that referees need as much help as possible. They are not robots and we should fully accept that they will not get everything right all the time. All we should be expecting is that they get the big decisions right and if there\u2019s a way to assist referees to make those decisions better and sharper we should look at every option available.", "label": 0}, "text-731": {"text": "Why Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads isn't as good as it sounds\nThis week, Twitter\u2019s founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey, announced the company\u2019s plan to ban all political ads on the platform. The ban encompasses paid tweets from candidates as well as \u201cpolitical issues\u201d ads. The announcement received widespread applause, in particular from leading Democratic figures, but far less enthusiasm from those who create, run or research political advertising.\nTwitter\u2019s ban on political ads is unnecessarily severe and simplistic, disadvantages challengers, and is likely unenforceable \u2013 but it was a great PR move for the company, for now.\nAs others have pointed out, there is lots of room for nuanced digital ad policy between Facebook\u2019s \u201ceverything goes\u201d model and Twitter\u2019s blackout. But Twitter\u2019s new policy is simplistic and likely will have unintended effects.\nAfter Dorsey tweeted the new policy, the Trump campaign released a statement decrying the move, pointing to the ban as more \u201cevidence\u201d for supposed anti-conservative bias. But the last person who needs Twitter ads is Trump. My research indicates that upwards of 80% of Trump tweets end up in news stories, earning him massive amounts of media exposure. The move by Twitter all but ensures a repeat of 2016, when Trump\u2019s Twitter tactics helped gain his campaign an estimated $2bn of earned media coverage.\nChallenger campaigns use low-cost digital ads to build lists of supporters, solicit donations, and mobilize volunteers\nMoving beyond Trump and the US presidential election, Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads disadvantages challengers and political newcomers. Digital ads are much cheaper than television ads, drawing in a wider scope of candidates, especially for down-ballot races. Though much of the public debate about digital ads focuses on hyped-up fears of nefarious persuasion, many more digital ads are used as an organizational tool. Challenger campaigns use low-cost digital ads to build lists of supporters, solicit donations and mobilize volunteers. Digital ads also allow political newcomers to introduce themselves \u2013 a tactic that often only breaks through with paid promotion.\nAs a smaller platform, Twitter brings in far less revenue in political ads than, say, Facebook. According to Twitter\u2019s CFO ,Ned Segal, the company brought in less than $3m from political ads during the 2018 US midterms. But Twitter offers political newcomers the ability to communicate to a crucial population: journalists and political elites. From Twitter, journalists infer what is newsworthy and tweets that get high engagement on the platform can lead to news coverage. Twitter\u2019s ban on political ads will make it harder for challengers and newcomers to break into the news cycle.\nA move to ban political ads still puts Twitter in the position of arbitrating political speech, as it must decide what is \u2013 and what is not \u2013 political. Identifying candidate ads is relatively straightforward, but identifying political issue ads is anything but. Though the full policy won\u2019t be public until 15 November, Twitter\u2019s policy and legal lead, Vijaya Gadde, offered a working definition: \u201cAds that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as: climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security, taxes).\u201d These broad categories are open to vast interpretive flexibility. And like Facebook and Google, Twitter has struggled to categorize ads and arbitrate their content at scale.\nPerhaps even more important is, from what perspective(s) will \u201cpolitical issues\u201d be defined? Advocating a certain healthcare policy may be political, but what about advertising locations of healthcare centers? What about women\u2019s healthcare centers? What about women\u2019s healthcare centers like Planned Parenthood? Can they advertise about breast exams? Birth control? Abortions? The broad category of \u201chealthcare\u201d gets fuzzy fast. Of course, defining anything as not political tends to come from a privileged point of view.\nWith the end of political ads, does that mean the end of the Twitter ad archive? The archive had problems, to be sure, but it did provide a measure of transparency. With a ban policy in place, Twitter should continue to embrace transparency and implement some method for showcasing what ads are rejected for being deemed political. Furthermore, Twitter should establish clear and specified mechanisms to contest these decisions. My research, with Daniel Kreiss, suggests that tech firms\u2019 vagaries around political ad guidelines, decisions and processes leave political users frustrated and leaves tech firms open to charges of conservative bias.\nFrom a PR perspective, though, Twitter\u2019s announcement was a slam dunk. The policy announcement via subtweet \u2013 itself pre-emptive and without details \u2013 took advantage of the negative focus on Facebook\u2019s everything-is-welcome perspective. Twitter backed Facebook into a moral corner, all to applause from the likes of AOC and HRC. But the messy work of defining political issue ads still makes Twitter an arbiter of political speech \u2013 a job they\u2019re not likely to perform well.\nFor those worried about the impact of digital political advertising on the health of democracies, a far better focus than the content of and the presence of the ads is the means by which they are targeted.\nShannon C McGregor researches political communication, social media, and public opinion as an assistant professor in the department of communication at the University of Utah.", "label": 0}, "text-732": {"text": "the world isn't going to halve co2 emissions by 2030; now what?\nU.S. climate analyst Roger Pielke writes at Forbes magazine: \"The bottom line of this analysis should be undeniable: There is simply no evidence that the world is, or is on the brink of, making 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society' that would be required for the deep decarbonization associated with a 1.5\u00b0C temperature target.

It\u2019s a band of strong winds, high up in the atmosphere that keeps bitterly cold air locked around the Arctic region. This circulation isn\u2019t considered a single storm, or even a weather pattern as such.\nOccasionally, the vortex can become distorted and meander far further south than normal. The phenomenon became widely known to Americans during a particularly frigid spell in 2014, when the media first started using the term \u201cpolar vortex\u201d. It was also a factor in the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d that battered the US east coast last year.\nThis time, the polar vortex has broken in two, bringing the coldest conditions in decades to the midwest US. On Wednesday, Chicago was 10 degrees F colder than Antarctica.\n\u201cAt the moment the vortex looks like two swirling blobs of cold air, one settled over North America, the other over Eurasia,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, the senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. \u201cIt splits up when there is sudden stratospheric warming.\u201d\nStudies have pointed to a recent increase in instances where the polar vortex has bulged down into heavily populated areas. Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why this is happening, with many identifying climate change as an influence.\nThere\u2019s some evidence that the jet stream, a meandering air current that flows over North America and Europe, is slowing and becoming wavier as the planet warms. The jet stream interacts with the polar vortex, helping bring numbing temperatures further south.\nScientists also point to a complex sequence of events involving sea ice, which is rapidly diminishing in the Arctic. As the ice retreats, summertime heat is absorbed by the dark ocean that lies underneath. This heat is released into the atmosphere during winter, spurring winds that can disrupt the polar vortex.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t entirely there yet but there\u2019s more and more support for this concept,\u201d said Francis. \u201cIt\u2019s a new and developing hot research topic.\u201d\nWell, Donald Trump certainly thinks so. \u201cIn coming days, expected to get even colder. People can\u2019t last outside even for minutes,\u201d the US president tweeted on Monday. \u201cWhat the hell is going on with Global Waming (sic)? Please come back fast, we need you!\u201d\nScientists were quick to point out climate change\u2019s role in allowing Arctic air to flow south, as well as to remind the president that winters still exist.\nA localized, albeit large, cold snap isn\u2019t representative of the rest of the planet, as Australians currently sweltering in searing record heat of more than 46C (114F) will be well aware of. The past four years have been the hottest on record for the globe.\nIn the US, record-breaking high temperatures are outnumbering record lows by a ratio of two to one. Research suggests this ratio will expand to 16 heat records for every cold record set if the US warms by 3C (5.4F) this century, which is likely unless greenhouse gases are severely curtailed.\nTrump\u2019s repeated tweets mocking climate science when the temperature drops are \u201cridiculous, in a word\u201d, said Francis. \u201cHe cares not to understand.

And the facts of climate change are not in question anymore. Everyone understands climate change is occurring, and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. We should not be aligned with such people. They\u2019re just literally lying.\u201d\nWhile he didn\u2019t vilify us by name, Mr. Schmidt was certainly targeting us, the climate scientists who collect and summarize thousands of articles for the\u00a0NIPCC\u2019s\u00a0Climate Change Reconsidered\u00a0reports, the hundreds who participate in Heartland Institute\u00a0climate conferences, and the 31,487 US scientists who have signed theOregon Petition, attesting that there is no convincing scientific evidence that humans are causing catastrophic warming or climate disruption.\nAll of us are firm skeptics of claims that humans are causing catastrophic global warming and climate change. We are not climate change \u201cdeniers.\u201d We know Earth\u2019s climate and weather are constantly in flux, undergoing recurrent fluctuations that range from flood and drought cycles to periods of low or intense hurricane and tornado activity, to the\u00a0Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 AD) and Little Ice Age (1350-1850) \u2013 and even to Pleistocene glaciers that\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0buried continents under a mile of ice.\nWhat we deny is the notion that humans can prevent these fluctuations, by ending fossil fuel use and emissions of plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide, which plays only an insignificant role in climate change.\nThe real deniers are people who think our climate was and should remain static and unchanging, such as 1900-1970, supposedly \u2013 during which time Earth actually warmed and then cooled, endured the Dust Bowl, and experienced periods of devastating hurricanes and tornadoes.\nThe real deniers refuse to recognize\u00a0that\u00a0natural\u00a0forces dictate weather and climate events. They deny that computer model predictions are completely at odds with real world events, that there has been no warming since 1995, and that several recent winters have been among the coldest in centuries in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, despite steadily rising CO2 levels. They refuse to acknowledge that, as of December 25, it\u2019s been\u00a03,347 days\u00a0since a Category 3-5 hurricane hit the US mainland; this is by far the longest such stretch since record-keeping began in 1900, if not since the American Civil War.\nWorst of all, they deny that their \u201csolutions\u201d hurt our children and grandchildren, by\u00a0driving up energy prices, threatening electricity reliability, thwarting job creation, and limiting economic growth in poor nations to what can be sustained via expensive wind, solar, biofuel and geothermal energy. Google\u2019s corporate motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d From our perspective, perpetuating poverty, misery, disease and premature death in poor African and Asian countries \u2013 in the name or preventing climate change \u2013 is evil.\nIt is truly disturbing that Mr. Schmidt could make a statement so thoroughly flawed in its basic premise. He runs a multi-billion dollar company that uses vast quantities of electricity to disseminate information throughout the world. Perhaps he should speak out on issues he actually understands. Perhaps he would be willing to debate us or Roy Spencer, David Legates, Pat Michaels and other climate experts.\nSetting aside the irrational loyalty of alarmists like Schmidt to a failed \u201cdangerous manmade climate change\u201d hypothesis, equally disturbing is the money wasted because of it. Consider an article written for the Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers\u2019 summit website by Google engineers\u00a0Ross Koningstein\u00a0and David Fork, who worked on Google\u2019s \u201cRE<C\u201d renewable energy initiative.\nBeginning in 2007, they say, \u201cGoogle committed significant resources to tackle the world\u2019s climate and energy problems. A few of these efforts proved very successful: Google deployed some of the most energy efficient data centers in the world, purchased large amounts of renewable energy, and offset what remained of its carbon footprint.\u201d\nIt\u2019s wonderful that Google improved the energy efficiency of its power-hungry data centers. But the project spent countless dollars and man hours. To what other actual benefits? To address precisely\u00a0what\u00a0climate and energy problems? And how exactly did Google offset its carbon footprint? By buying \u201ccarbon credits\u201d from outfits like the\u00a0New Forests Company, which drove impoverished Ugandan villagers out of their homes, set fire to their houses and burned a young boy to death?\nWhat if, as skeptics like us posit and actual evidence reflects, man-made climate change is not in fact occurring? That would mean there is no threat to humans or our planet, and lowering Google\u2019s CO2 footprint would bring no benefits. In fact, it would keep poor nations poverty stricken and deprived of modern technologies \u2013 and thus unable to adapt to climate change. Imagine what Google could have accomplished if its resources had been channeled to solving\u00a0actual\u00a0problems with\u00a0actual\u00a0solutions!\nIn 2011, the company decided its RE<C project would not meet its goals. Google shut it down. In their article, Koningstein and Fork\u00a0admit that the real result of all of their costly research was to reach the following conclusion:\u00a0\u201cgreen energy is simply not economically, viable and resources that we as a society waste in trying to make it so would be better used to improve the efficiencies in established energy technologies like coal.\u201d\nSkeptics like us reached that conclusion long ago. It is the primary reason for our impassioned pleas that that the United States and other developed nations\u00a0stop\u00a0making energy policy decisions based on the flawed climate change hypothesis.\u00a0However, the article\u2019s most breathtaking statement was this:\n\u201cClimate scientists\u00a0have definitively shown\u00a0that the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere poses a looming danger....\u00a0\u00a0A 2008 paper by James Hansen,\u00a0former director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies\u2026 showed the true gravity of the situation. In it, Hansen set out to determine what level of atmospheric CO2\u00a0society should aim for \u2018if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted.\u2019 His climate models showed that exceeding 350 parts per million CO2\u00a0in the atmosphere would likely have catastrophic effects. We\u2019ve already blown past that limit. Right now, environmental monitoring shows concentrations around 400 ppm.\u2026\u201d\nWe would never presume to question the sincerity, intellect, dedication or talent of these two authors. However, this statement presents a stunning failure in applying Aristotelian logic. Even a quick reading would make the following logical conclusions instantly obvious:\nThis kind of reasoning (the scientific method) has served progress and civilization well since the Seventeenth Century.

Look to sexual health clinics\nWill the secretary of state for health and social care get away with such barefaced shamelessness in his apparent plans to abolish waiting-time targets for A&E? Matt Hancock\u2019s faintly plausible excuse is that the four-hour target is a perverse incentive to treat an ingrown toenail, at three hours and 50 minutes, ahead of heart attacks and road accident victims. But most A&Es triage efficiently, diverting minor ailments to GPs on site; their real crisis is 12-hour trolley waits for very ill people queuing for reduced numbers of hospital beds.\nA&Es are the thermometers of the NHS, and they reached boiling point long ago, embarrassing a government that has starved the service of funds as never before in its history. Hancock and the prime minister now regularly speak of the NHS receiving its \u201cbiggest cash boost\u201d in history, a factoid that describes half a glass of water offered in a drought.\nThere was a target to give every patient access within 48 hours \u2026 But that target \u2018has been quietly dropped'\nIn many unreported corners of the NHS that are less photogenic than A&E, the abolition of targets may not be a new habit. You can\u2019t get much more hidden from view than sexual health clinics. There was a target to give every patient access within 48 hours, counting numbers unseen in that time. But that target \u201chas been quietly dropped\u201d says Dr John McSorley, of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. Now, he says, despite rising cases of gonorrhea and syphilis, up by 20% in England between 2016 and 2018, many patients face \u201cmultiple turnaways\u201d from one clinic after another. With funding for sexual health cut significantly, he says clinics now \u201cdemand-manage\u201d.\n\u201cWe no longer have booked appointments, so patients self-select for the seriousness of their condition by willingness to wait for hours.\u201d\nMore are treated online, where they are sent a package to return samples to labs, with online prescriptions. But even that is strictly rationed: \u201cWith no money to pay for it, some councils only allow 10 cases a day online. People have to get online straight after midnight. Fifteen minutes later, all 10 slots are gone, and they have to wait to try again the next night at midnight.\u201d\nSexual health services were a casualty of the disastrous Health and Care Social Act 2012, which fragmented services: it stripped all public health from the NHS to hand over to local authorities. Then the ringfence was taken off the funding, so cash-strapped councils cut, and cut again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them\u201d, says McSorley. \u201cLocal authorities are banned from debt, so they\u2019re making the hardest choices, between cutting a clinic or closing a library.\u201d Councils are due no extra money in the budget, beyond a sticking plaster for social care. \nA recent health select committee report shows how an overall fall in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u2013 very good news \u2013 is due to the brilliant success of eradicating genital warts with the HPV vaccine for young people. But the figures conceal a rise in other clinic-treated STIs \u2013 such as chlamydia, which causes pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women. There has been 22% drop in young people being screened for chlamydia since 2014, while just over a quarter of local authorities have reduced spending on STI testing and treatment services by a fifth or more.\nThe good news is a steep fall in new transmissions of HIV, down by 73% from 2014 to 2018: government figures out today show how effective antiretroviral drugs have been for those with HIV and how effective pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is to protect those at risk from HIV infection. However, an estimated 7,500 people are living with HIV but unaware of it: two in five of those diagnosed in 2018 were already at a late stage, which comes with a tenfold increased risk of death within a year.\nHere\u2019s an odd slipperiness in these official figures: note that today\u2019s report comes from Public Health England, and yet unusually the press release puts the emphasis on the whole UK. Why? Because England\u2019s figures are far worse than Scotland and Northern Ireland\u2019s \u2013 because only England has yet to make PrEP available to all at risk, while anyone can get the drug in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Only those on a special trial get it in England; others have to pay privately. The pills themselves are cheap, but clinic costs to supervise treatment are higher. The English health secretary strongly resisted the cost of treating all who could be protected. The target to stop any new transmissions by 2030 is easily achievable: these drugs are so effective that no one need die. Scotland and Northern Ireland show how many more come forward for tests and treatment when these are offered for free. Nonetheless, in his press release today, Hancock proclaims his \u201cunwavering commitment to prevention\u201d.\nIf he thinks the public don\u2019t care much about STIs, a grubby service for dubious people, here\u2019s something to frighten everyone. Anti-microbial resistance is appearing in gonorrhoea: \u201cWe are on a slippery slope to losing it,\u201d McSorley warns. And anti-microbial resistance spills over into other diseases.

Williamson says critics dismiss his work because it is popular, although the quality of his work has also been questioned. He once accused the Sydney Theatre Company of ignoring his plays \u201cbecause I\u2019m not theatre with a capital T\u201d.\nWilliamson argues his playwrighting has always examined human psychology and verbal self-deception. But he now says he wants to make way for younger voices, including the minority playwrights he acknowledges have been denied a platform, to tackle the many issues Australia is facing. He\u2019s had a \u201cdream run\u201d, he emphasises, and \u201ccan\u2019t whinge\u201d about his unabated box office success.\nThe whole process is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole business of opening nights\nFor Williamson, who has five children and 14 grandchildren, retirement is also motivated by his health: he has a long-term heart rhythm problem and several years ago suffered a transient ischaemic attack, which temporarily paralysed the right side of his body. \u201cThe whole process is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole business of opening nights,\u201d he says. \u201cFor many years, I couldn\u2019t even go to an opening night. I had to have Kristin [Williamson, his wife and a fellow writer] reporting to me how things were going.\n\u201cYou go to a brilliant opening night, you know it has connected, and then you think [of the critics]: \u2018Oh those fuckers\u2019. I remember one [review] line that said, \u2018I sat with a dark cloud hovering above me as people fell off their seats laughing around me\u2019. And you think, what is so terrible about that? Why did the black cloud descend upon him to see people enjoying themselves in the theatre?\u201d\nFamously, Williamson\u2019s writing has often been clearly drawn from his experiences. In the early 1970s, he left his then-pregnant wife for his current wife, who also left her husband. This became the basis for his early play Jugglers Three, a depiction of two marriages breaking up, rewritten many years later as Third World Blues in which a character called Elizabeth accuses a character called Neville, based on Williamson, of having a \u201chyperinflated ego\u201d.\nIs everything in his life playwriting material? \u201cWell, I have drawn on life. Any writer who says they don\u2019t is lying. But you do change and alter [the details].\u201d\nIn her 2009 biography of Williamson, Kristin \u2013 who met the playwright when she was cast in one of his early plays \u2013 argued that the \u201coutraged letters and emails\u201d her husband \u201cfired off in fits of rage\u201d to critics, directors and producers were borne of a sensitivity that also made him an \u201castute dramatist\u201d who could perceive \u201cmalignant undercurrents in social behaviour\u201d.\nWe meet in the rehearsal room for his new play Family Values. Williamson stands more than two metres tall; he used to fantasise about being shorter so he wouldn\u2019t stand out so much. He is affable, sincere, a good listener, eloquent and forthcoming in his responses, although he brings up the critics of his work much earlier than I had planned: it\u2019s clearly a spectre that will always bother him, even while acknowledging he has overreacted on occasion.\nHe agrees with his wife\u2019s take on his psychology \u2013 but adds the rhythms of the \u201cbitter fighting\u201d between his late parents, gregarious retail saleswoman mother Elvie and quiet accountant father Keith, also \u201cenormously\u201d influenced his work.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise it at the time, but my brother and I grew up in a house of perpetual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was hardly a minute when they weren\u2019t having a go at each other. It wasn\u2019t until the age of 11 that I realised it was a bit more complex than that, when I caught my mother goading my father to the point of an explosion.\n\u201cHe was never a physically violent man, but finally he could be provoked into calling her names. I remember when my mother raced out to the laundry, and I followed her: she was chuckling away.\u201d A few years before her death, Williamson brought up the memory, and asked her what was going on. \u201cWell, it did get pretty boring in the country,\u201d she answered.\n\u201cShe was sparking the drama,\u201d he says now. \u201cI spent my young life wondering, \u2018How can I avoid this? Is this what marriage means?\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s almost painful to pick up the Murdoch press every day and see the blatant attack on social progressivism\nBorn in 1942, Williamson grew up in the middle-class suburb of Bentleigh, then on Melbourne\u2019s outskirts. The family moved when he was 12 to country Bairnsdale.\nAt the time, theatres in Australia offered virtually no plays about contemporary Australian society. In 1964, Williamson became Monash University\u2019s first graduate in mechanical engineering \u2013 but as an assistant project engineer at General Motors-Holden he would read Chekhov under the desk.\nWilliamson\u2019s subsequent study of psychology at Melbourne University would inspire him to think of himself as a \u201csocial scientist\u201d, and he began writing plays. In 1971, his middle-class suburban election night satire, Don\u2019s Party, was a hit at the Pram Factory, but the collective that ran La Mama theatre in Carlton thought it too bourgeoisie \u2013 so he wrote them a hard-hitting look at police and male brutality, The Removalists, which won him a prestigious award in London.\nInstead of moving his career there in the wake of this international attention, he sensed his continued connection to Australian place and vernacular was critical to his writing. Williamson stayed home and rode the 1970s Australian \u201cnew wave\u201d film industry resurgence, adapting many of his stage plays into successfully produced screenplays.\nIn his youth, Kristin Williamson wrote, David \u201cbecame a zealous leftwinger, to the extent that he tried to convert his parents\u201d. Is he still politically to the left? \u201cOh yes,\u201d he says now. \u201cDespite what some of my critics have said about me being a social conservative, there is an underlying social concern in all but a few of my plays. I always hope to be entertaining on the surface, but saying something about the state of our society in the subtext.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t lost that. I am so angered by the growing injustices and inequalities in the world that it does still fire me up. It\u2019s almost painful to pick up the Murdoch press every day and see the blatant attack on social progressivism of any kind, the fervent belief in neoliberalism, despite the world heading towards a real catastrophe.\n\u201cThe honchos tend to be ageing white males, wealthy white males, who are incredibly threatened by the science of climate change, because it threatens their whole world view that neoliberalism has delivered huge prosperity to the world, that growth can go on forever, that there will be no evil consequences.\u201d\nIndeed, Williamson\u2019s final two new plays offer social critiques of Australia now. Family Values reflects the writer\u2019s disdain for Australia\u2019s refugee policy, and has an asylum seeker character. Mandatory offshore detention \u201chas been one of the morally despicable acts the Australian government has carried out, and both sides are guilty \u2013 Labor started it\u201d, he says. \u201cI fail to understand Jacqui Lambie voting against medevac because she said openly medevac is no threat to Australian security.\u201d\nThe other play, Crunch Time \u2013 a blackly comic story of a father and son healing a relationship \u2013 carries the theme of assisted death. Williamson laments the failure of most states to adopt voluntary euthanasia laws. \u201cThe NSW Liberal party seems to be still in thrall of the religious right, and it\u2019s the lizard brain dictating the rational capacity of human beings; it\u2019s some emotional fear that someone is going to turn the switch off on them, or God wants to prolong our pain as long as possible before we have a decent death,\u201d he says.\nWould Williamson want voluntary euthanasia for himself, if it came to that? \u201cAbsolutely. I saw a friend die recently of pancreatic cancer, and they fade away to a human skeleton. It\u2019s a horrible way to leave an image for your loved ones.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather go out when they still recognise me as me, so there\u2019s a bit of vanity, but also I\u2019d want to avoid the extreme pain of the end game.\u201d\n\u2022 Family Values runs at SBW Stables at Griffin Theatre in Sydney from 17 January until 7 March. Crunch Time runs at Ensemble Theatre in Sydney from 14 February until 9 April.

Epidural blocks, injected into the area around the spine, are highly effective, but they have to be given by an anaesthetist in an obstetric unit. They can lead to a drop in blood pressure in up to 14% of women, so close monitoring is important.\nSome women claim that they are being denied epidurals because of what the Sunday Telegraph says is \u201ca cult of natural childbirth\u201d in six hospital trusts. Several claimed they were told they were either insufficiently dilated or too far dilated to have an epidural.\nThe trusts, which included Homerton university hospital trust in London, university hospitals of Leicester trust, Surrey and Sussex healthcare NHS trust and Western Sussex hospitals NHS foundation trust, all said they endeavoured to comply with guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and give pain relief in a timely manner.\nHancock said he would investigate the allegations.

It has been given permission for a judicial review of the Professional Standards Authority\u2019s (PSA) decision to re-accredit the Society of Homeopaths as an official regulatory body. It will argue the PSA is failing to protect children.\nThe court hearing has been granted at a time of increased concern over falling vaccination rates, with the UK having lost its measles-free status and health minister Matt Hancock considering the introduction of mandatory vaccinations for school children.\nOn the books of the Society of Homeopaths are practitioners of Cease therapy, which stands for complete elimination of autistic spectrum expression. Cease was invented by a Dutch doctor called Tinus Smits, who died of cancer in 2010.\nCease therapists claim autism is caused mostly by vaccines and \u201ctoxic medication and other toxic substances\u201d. Therapists offer homeopathic treatments, dietary restrictions and vitamin C in doses higher than recommended in national guidelines. Smits believed that fever and diarrhoea in autistic children was a manifestation of the toxins leaving the body and should not be treated.\nThe Federation of Holistic Therapists, accredited by the PSA, also admits homeopaths, but they have a very clear anti-Cease position.\nThe PSA re-accredited the Society of Homeopaths in April in spite of complaints. In its annual review, it said its panel \u201chad been concerned by the potentially severe health risks posed by Cease therapy. The panel had noted the society\u2019s comments that it did not support harmful practices related to Cease, such as discouraging vaccinations and encouraging extreme doses of dietary supplements.\u201d The Society of Homeopaths undertook to review the practice of homeopaths using Cease therapy.\nThe Good Thinking Society says the PSA is effectively sanctioning the use of Cease therapy and the anti-vaccine stance of homeopaths who practice it.\nMichael Marshall, project director of Good Thinking, said: \u201cBeing part of the PSA\u2019s accredited voluntary register scheme is clearly a boon to the Society of Homeopaths and its members \u2013 this is apparent from how prominently homeopaths, including those who practice the anti-vaccination Cease therapy, display the PSA\u2019s logo on their websites and marketing materials. Accreditation by the PSA is used as a signifier that those homeopaths are competent, trustworthy and safe, but that accreditation can only carry any meaning if the PSA takes seriously their duty to protect the public from harmful practices.\n\u201cThe PSA have acknowledged that members of the Society of Homeopaths are offering a treatment that is harmful and that is targeted at a particularly vulnerable group. Given those concerns, for the PSA to go ahead and accredit these homeopaths all the same not only makes a mockery of their whole accreditation scheme, but it is arguably in breach of its legal duties.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the PSA said: \u201cWe are aware of the claims made by the Good Thinking Society but as the matter is currently before the court, we are not in a position to comment further.\u201d The Society of Homeopaths did not respond to a request for comment.", "label": 0}, "text-739": {"text": "ABC journalists' climate crisis group survives political heat\nLast year Justin Milne got into trouble for acting like he ran the ABC, giving directions for staff to be sacked or telling management what they should do.

The 56-year-old man responsible cannot be identified.\u201d\nThe second one was a correction which it says it didn\u2019t need to make but did so \u201cin good faith\u201d. A reader was concerned that an ABC Eyre Peninsula article stated that teenagers had walked through an \u201cuntouched\u201d landscape in 1843 when Indigenous people had been in Australia for many thousands of years. The ABC said the article did say they were \u201cthe first western people\u201d to walk south of Streaky Bay and included a picture caption which clearly stated that they \u201cwalked on beaches no westerners had ever stepped on\u201d.\n\u201cNevertheless, in good faith, the ABC amended the article to state: \u2018In 1843 two teenagers fled the brutal life of a whaling station at Fowlers Bay on the far west coast of South Australia and walked more than 500 kilometres through a pristine landscape to be rescued\u2019.\u201d\nJournalists who work for digital media startups or digital-only publications \u2013 like Daily Mail Australia \u2013 will be treated equally to their print colleagues under a landmark Fair Work ruling handed down on Thursday.\nThe Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance welcomed the decision, which they said \u201cremoves the award\u2019s outdated focus solely on print journalists which placed digital workers at a disadvantage\u201d. Digital journalists will now have access to minimum standards for wages, penalty rates, overtime and other conditions of employment such as hours of work and breaks just as their print colleagues do, the media union said.\nThe MEAA media federal president, Marcus Strom, said: \u201cDigital is the reality of all newsrooms today. It\u2019s about time the award caught up with the working lives of our members.\u201d\nGuardian Australia\u2019s journalists have access to penalty and overtime rates under their enterprise agreement, which came into effect in July 2019.", "label": 0}, "text-740": {"text": "'Most complex health crisis in history': Congo struggles to contain Ebola\nMoise Kitsakihu-Mbira has lost his brother, his grandson and 11 other family members to Ebola. When he himself fell sick he sought treatment in secret. His family don\u2019t believe the virus exists and think a man in their village poisoned them.\nRefusal to believe in the existence of Ebola is one difficulty for doctors who say the current outbreak of the deadly virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the \u201cmost complex public health emergency in history\u201d and warn it could drag on for months.\nFollowing two deaths across the border in Uganda two weeks ago, officials admit they are struggling to identify and track cases around the north-eastern city of Butembo, particularly in countryside dominated by the Mai Mai militia and where a highly mobile population mean cases continue to emerge.\nWith more than 2,577 confirmed cases and more than 1,803 confirmed deaths, the outbreak in the eastern DRC is the second largest in history. It has a 67% fatality rate and 11 months after it began, the case numbers are still escalating. It is disproportionately affecting women (55% of cases) and children (28%).\nThe WHO declared the outbreak an\u00a0international public health emergency\u00a0in July 2019. The same month saw the\u00a0the first diagnosis of a case in Goma, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. In early August Rwanda\u00a0announced that it was closing its border with DRC.\nThe WHO has long said that the national and regional risk levels are very high and containment of the spread to North Kivu and Ituri provinces was unlikely, unless a break in the fighting made it safe for health workers.\nEbola\u00a0hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus that has a reservoir among forest animals, including monkeys and bats. It is spread through body fluids, which is why carers \u2013 mostly female relatives and nursing staff \u2013 are particularly at risk. It causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection.\nDrugs are still experimental. Patients are isolated and treated by nurses wearing full protective body suits and masks who try to boost their immune response. Friends and relatives are quarantined for 21 days. Prevention measures include washing hands at every opportunity and safe burial practices, with no touching or washing of the body, as is traditional in some cultures.\nThe 2013 and 2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea spread for months through forest regions in west\u00a0Africa\u00a0where Ebola was unknown before the emergency was recognised. It escalated when it emerged in towns and cities, with 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths.\nDRC successfully stamped out nine previous Ebola outbreaks in rural areas within a matter of a few months.\u00a0Aid\u00a0agencies, infectious disease experts and the WHO say it will be very hard to bring this outbreak under control, even though they have had vaccines and experimental drugs from the outset.\nThere is almost no functioning state in much of eastern DRC. There is an almost total lack of basic services such as power, education, roads, healthcare, and the authority of the government only extends to the edges of urban areas.\nPolice are corrupt, predatory and violent. In rural zones, militia and armed bands provide security and employment opportunities but also steal, rape and kill at will. It is one of the most hostile environments faced by aid and health workers anywhere in the world.\nMistrust of officials and foreigners is harming efforts to tackle the disease and conspiracy theories are rampant. Some believe the outbreak is fake news spread by rapacious NGOs and the UN to justify their presence in the country and allow the extraction of valuable mineral resources.\u00a0\nSarah Boseley\u00a0and\u00a0Jason Burke\nThe outbreak, with more than 2,100 cases and more than 1,412 confirmed deaths in just over a year, is the second largest in history, despite recent availability of an effective experimental vaccine.\nCentred on three locations in North Kivu \u2013 Beni, Mangina and Butembo \u2013 the response led by the World Health Organization and DRC\u2019s ministry of health faces political security and cultural complexities.\nAmong them is widespread resistance to the idea that Ebola exists, a conspiracy fuelled by some political candidates in last year\u2019s national elections.\nIn Butembo, a population dominated by the Nande ethnic group, a false narrative has also emerged that the virus \u2013 if it exists \u2013 has been brought in from outside to target a people who have long felt victimised in the region\u2019s interminable conflicts.\nThe city has seen armed assaults on Ebola treatment centres, the murder of a WHO doctor, and frequent attacks on vaccination teams.\nIn the latest incident, on Monday last week, a driver working with an Ebola response team in the neighbouring city of Beni was left in critical condition after angry crowds hurled rocks at him and set his vehicle on fire.\n\u201cWe are looking at one of the most complex health emergencies the world has seen,\u201d says John Johnson of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), whose teams pulled out of Butembo over security risks. He was one of three officials who framed the crisis in similar terms.\nMoise Kitsakihu-Mbira is now a motorbike ambulance driver who discreetly brings the sick to the treatment centre from communities where stigma remains.\n\u201cIt was my grandson who died first,\u201d he tells the Guardian. Many family members touched the body \u2013 highly risky as Ebola is spread through physical contact with victims\u2019 bodies or those showing symptoms.\nThey started dying. First his brother, then, one after another, twelve others.\n\u201cEven when they were told it was Ebola, the family wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey threw stones at the team sent to offer vaccinations. They thought it was poison.\u201d\nThe man accused of poisoning the family was killed by other villagers.\nMoise did believe in Ebola\u2019s existence and sought treatment when he too fell sick, despite his local doctor telling him that Ebola was not real.\n\u201cI was telling people that it wasn\u2019t poison,\u201d he recalled. Finally he visited a hospital where Ebola was confirmed. Even then, as he sent texts telling his family where he was, his wife refused the vaccine for herself and their children.\nDespite its sprawling size and the constant buzz of motorbike taxis, Butembo feels neglected, with potholed dirt roads, open sewers, crumbling infrastructure and its perfect storm of overlapping issues that conspire to hamper the Ebola response. It\u2019s a major commercial centre, and residents trade widely, across the borders into Uganda and Rwanda.\nUnlike Beni where the main militia \u2013 the Allied Democratic Forces \u2013 are located in the countryside, the Mai Mai are embedded within the population of Butembo, with political links. Even by DRC standards, a strong hostility has emerged here not only to central government but to all outsiders.\nDr Ibrahima Soc\u00e9 Fall, the senior WHO official for the Ebola response in Butembo, described the reaction to the arrival of his teams last year in the midst of national elections. Even those who accepted Ebola\u2019s existence were not necessarily happy to see them.\n\u201cThe view was \u2013 you\u2019re only here for Ebola, and when that is over you\u2019ll go and we will have all the same problems as before.\u201d\nConspiracies spiralled. Some centred on the disease, others on the treatment centres. In the midst of this febrile atmosphere the government made the catastrophic decision to cancel voting in the virus-struck region, contributing further to the wildest theories about the outbreak as a political tool.\nPrivately, some of those involved in the medical response also concede that mistakes have been made. Medical teams assumed that the epidemic would follow a similar pattern to recent outbreaks in west Africa, and were blindsided by the hostility and suspicion, recognising too late that political negotiation, as well as medical intervention, was needed.\n\u201cThe biggest problem has been security. I think if we had the access we need, we could have finished dealing with it a long time ago,\u201d says Soc\u00e9\u2019s colleague Michel Yao, in charge of the day-to-day WHO response. \n\u201cEvery time there was an incident we would be prevented from working for three to four days. There would be demonstrations and anyone could be attacked. We became the target.\u201d\nIn the most serious incident, on 19 April, Dr Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, a Cameroonian epidemiologist, was killed at Butembo\u2019s University Hospital.\nAccording to colleagues, Dr Kiboung was wearing his hospital scrubs but nothing that identified him as working for WHO at the hospital. As he attended a meeting in the conference room, armed men burst into the room.\nForcing those present to the floor, the gunmen accused the assembled health workers of \u201cperpetuating false rumours about Ebola\u201d before shooting the doctor in the stomach.\nArmed assailants also attacked Ebola treatment centres in Butembo and Katwa, then run by MSF, burning parts of the facilities and firing at buildings.\nThis upsurge of violence has forced medical teams to travel with armed escorts and to reinforce clinics with sand-bagged protection.\nAnd an atmosphere of risk persists. During the Guardian\u2019s visit to the main coordination centre in Katwa, four men suspected of being Mai Mai militia infiltrated the compound. Two fled and two were arrested by guards. No one is clear about precise motives.\nWhat has changed dramatically since the first cases last year is the emergence of new facilities and tactics to deal with the disease. Although some 300 health centres were listed at the beginning of the outbreak, many of those, admits Dr Soc\u00e9, were desperately basic.\n\u201cThey were often just one room and some of them [were used] for traditional medicine. People would be drinking out of the same pot or a syringe would be used ten times. A child would go in for treatment for malaria and come out with Ebola.\u201d\nDedicated centres have now been built in key locations where medical staff in biohazard suits, looking like visiting astronauts, bustle between isolation units and decontamination showers.\nMeals are delivered to patients in observation areas via slides while in plastic isolation cubes, in controlled environments, doctors work on the most serious cases.\nThere is lodging for relatives, and children are cared for by Ebola survivors immune to catching the virus a second time. There is a morgue and purpose-built screened area where families can view a body ahead of the burial process.\nVaccinations have been speeded up and a half dose of vaccine has been found to be as effective as the full shot.\nIt remains exhausting work.\n\u201cWe have the vaccine and new ways of treating the disease,\u201d says Dr Marie-Claire Kolie, a Guinean doctor in Butembo who worked on Ebola in her own country.\n\u201cThe big difference is that this is occurring in a conflict zone and that is accentuating everything. We\u2019ve seen the numbers of cases in the centres declining, and that\u2019s good news, but we are still seeing deaths in the community and they are difficult to investigate. And there\u2019s still no confidence in the community even now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still facing a problem of fake news and rumours circulating on WhatsApp groups.\u201d\nThose continuing difficulties were dramatically underlined when a family of six travelled into Uganda from the Mabalako area outside Butembo \u2013 a difficult location with little government presence \u2013 with two victims of Ebola among them. Cases from this area have also reintroduced the disease into areas in the north-east of the DRC, thought to be under control.\n\u201cIt was very clear in the first weeks of the outbreak,\u201d says Dr Soc\u00e9, \u201cthat it was going to be complicated. And if it was not controlled it would become even more complicated.\n\u201cEven so, what happened later, with the security situation and the cancellation of the elections \u2026 We didn\u2019t expect that to happen.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-741": {"text": "Older people could face extended coronavirus lockdown, Lords hears\nPoliticians have warned that the government is considering a \u201cblanket ban\u201d to prevent older people leaving their homes during the coronavirus crisis.\nThe health minister, Lord James Bethell, twice refused to deny that older people will be told to stay in extended lockdown in response to questions in the Lords on Wednesday.\n\u201cI was very concerned by the government\u2019s refusal to answer my question,\u201d said Lord David Blunkett, the former home secretary. \u201cOlder people must not be subjected to arbitrary incarceration as well as isolation.\u201d\nBlunkett asked Bethell what assessment the government has made of the impact of the restriction of movement on those defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable and what plans they have to change those restrictions.\n\u201cThe more the government make restrictions age-related rather than risk-related, the more they risk people pushing back very heavily and refusing to keep to the rules,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe government picked the arbitrary age of 70 out of the air back in March when they announced the initial lockdown based on age. Age is no longer a risk factor unless underlying health conditions are attached.\u201d\nRos Altmann, the former pension minister, said: \u201cI have real fears that ministers are considering blanket bans to prevent older people leaving their homes during the current crisis. Ministerial responses suggest government advisers may be seriously recommending using chronological age as a criterion for deciding whether people will be allowed to leave their homes.\n\u201cSuch policies are normally the mark of authoritarian regimes, not a mature democracy. Collective punishment based on age should be no more acceptable than using gender, ethnicity or body mass index as defining factors.\n\u201cBlaming the virus is not a valid justification. These are conscious policy decisions. Isolating all older people, if others are allowed out, also risks damaging their physical and mental health.\u201d\nBethell was forced to defend himself against accusations in the Lords from the former Labour energy minister Lord Truscott of a danger \u201cthat extending the lockdown for only certain groups might unintentionally discriminate against elderly and vulnerable people\u201d.\nBethell was also unable to satisfy Conservative peer Lord Lucas, who asked: \u201cCan we please ensure that vulnerable people have agency, that those who want to act as the unvulnerable are allowed to, that grandparents who wish to see their children are allowed to and, at the same time, that those who are young and vulnerable are protected in their decision to continue to isolate and are not discriminated against because of it?\u201d\nBethell said: \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact that those who are medically vulnerable are singled out by the virus. We have to put in place measures to protect and safeguard their lives. It is the virus that makes this discrimination, not the government.\n\u201cOn a personal level I completely understand where [Lord Lucas] is coming from. I have elderly relations who I would like to see, hold, touch and socialise with. But, as I said, I cannot hide from the house that this virus is an extremely predatory killer that has in its sights particular demographic groups, including the elderly and in particular those with conditions.

Control pants are utilitarian, shadowy items of doubtful beauty, while catwalk-worthy lingerie is designed to be seen, to dazzle and titillate. But they share a mission, which is the pursuit of an ideal, hourglass-curve body. Now, the size-inclusivity and body-positivity movement that puts Lizzo on the cover of next month\u2019s British Vogue is having an impact on the shapewear sector of the underwear market, too \u2013 but not in the way you might have expected.\nThe mood music around underwear has seen squished-together cleavage replaced with comfy bralets in ad campaigns, and Beyonc\u00e9 striking a queenly pose on Instagram in a burgundy bra, turquoise satin knickers, baby bump and veil. But, far from throwing out their control pants and accepting their squidgy inner thighs and potbellies, millennials are driving a shapewear boom. A recent report by the business analyst Textiles Intelligence predicted that the global market for shapewear will expand at an annual rate of 4% a year between now and 2022.\nWomen tell us constantly how confident they feel wearing our shapewear\nKim Kardashian West entered the market this year with her \u201csolutionwear\u201d range, SKIMS \u2013 a name whose phonic adjacency to Spanx is unlikely to be an accident. Whatever your views on the Kardashians, you will acknowledge that, when it comes to pop culture, their money-making instincts are rarely wrong. The fashion search engine Lyst reports that searches are up year on year in shapewear for biker shorts (137%) and bodysuits (83%). Oprah recently started a frenzy for the Perfect Black Pant by Spanx \u2013 a pair of trousers with inbuilt tummy and thigh control \u2013 when she included it on her annual holiday-season wishlist of Favourite Things, gushing that she had called Spanx\u2019s founder, Sara Blakely, to applaud and thank her for creating the \u201cultraflattering\u201d trousers.\nHeist, a cult tights and shapewear label that prides itself on skin-tone inclusivity, and recently launched sustainable fishnet tights, has tackled the issue head on with a series of posters that posed the question: \u201cShapewear is anti-feminist, right?\u201d and invited consumers to discuss on social media. \u201cWe posed that question because we hear it a lot \u2013 the idea that shapewear is the modern corset, and therefore anti-feminist,\u201d says Fiona Fairhurst, the vice-president of innovation at the brand. \u201cThe response to the campaign was huge. People really engaged. There were those who challenged us on the basis that the shapewear industry perpetuates the idea of a \u2018perfect\u2019 body, and we had a really interesting panel that delved into how much we alter our appearances for ourselves and others. For us, it\u2019s about personal choice without judgment. But, let\u2019s be clear, we don\u2019t think that wearing shapewear is a feminist act akin to fighting for equal pay or challenging gender representation.\u201d\nBrands such as Heist and Rihanna\u2019s Savage X Fenty lingerie claim that by being inclusive to a spectrum of skin tones and range of body sizes \u2013 at point of purchase, but also in advertising imagery and in Rihanna\u2019s case on the New York fashion week catwalk \u2013 they are disrupting the shapewear and lingerie worlds with an authentic celebration of all women. \u201cWomen tell us constantly how confident they feel wearing our shapewear,\u201d says Fairhurst. Heist\u2019s language is that of empowerment: a \u201cbetter experience\u201d, a collection that \u201cworks for everyone and has comfort front of mind\u201d.\nWhether or not shapewear has truly developed in philosophy, it has evolved technically. I can report that the new generation of products from Heist and Spanx are infinitely more comfortable than control pants were in their original iteration. Advanced fabric technology allows pressure to be evenly distributed through a wide waistband. The rigid seams that once dug tightly into flesh, a daylong reminder of the very bit of your body you were trying to magic away, are no more. Spanx leggings, with seamless legs and a flattening power waistband, have a surface grace, which belies their engineering. Fairhurst made her name with Speedo\u2019s Fastskin, a swimsuit inspired by sharkskin, which attempts to emulate the ability of a shark to travel through water with about 10% less energy expenditure than a fish with smooth skin. At Heist, she uses \u201cHeroPanel\u201d technology, which mimics fascia, the body\u2019s connective tissue that sits between muscle and skin, to provide \u201ca natural support system\u201d that can lift as well as compress \u2013 essential for a generation that wants a high, prominent bottom as well as a small waist.\n\u201cAt a fundamental level, our shapewear is comfortable, looks good and doesn\u2019t make you sweat. The HeroPanels have 20,000 laser perforations, making them 100% breathable,\u201d says Fairhurst. \u201cThey also take up to 5cm off your waist in total comfort,\u201d she adds, \u201cif that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-745": {"text": "Keir Starmer: only a federal UK 'can repair shattered trust in politics'\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leadership frontrunner, has called for a fully federal UK, devolving power to the nations and regions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after Brexit.\nThe shadow Brexit secretary said only a new federal structure for the UK could \u201crepair the shattered trust in politics\u201d, amid growing clamour in Scotland for another independence referendum.\nHe said there would need to be a national conversation about a new constitutional settlement. However, it could mean taking more power away from Westminster and handing it to regional authorities and devolved governments on areas such as raising taxes, green industrial strategies and transport systems.\nThe idea of a federal UK was championed by former prime minister Gordon Brown after the Scottish independence referendum of 2014. He called for a \u201cpatriotic third way\u201d with power over fisheries, farming, welfare and far more taxation handed to devolved governments.\nAt the time, the Scottish Conservatives called on Brown to say whether another referendum would be needed to gain approval for such sweeping changes, while the SNP dismissed it as undeliverable as Labour was \u201cnot even in a position to deliver pizza\u201d.\nStarmer will say constitutional change is overdue and that Labour will listen to people before coming up with a new constitutional settlement involving a codified, written constitution.\nAhead of three days of campaigning in Scotland, England and Wales, he will say on Monday that the country needs a new political consensus to \u201cput power, wealth and opportunity back into the hands of the people\u201d.\n\u201cWe need a new constitutional settlement: a large-scale devolution of power and resources. This will involve building a new long-term political and constitutional consensus. I believe that could best be built on the principle of federalism,\u201d he will say.\nEarlier on Sunday, Rebecca Long-Bailey, another leading contender, took up a similar theme to Starmer as she called for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments to be put on an \u201cequal footing\u201d with Westminster instead of being \u201cservile\u201d satellites.\nWithout using the term federalism, she said Holyrood and the Welsh assembly needed to be as \u201cautonomous and independent\u201d as they could possibly be and backed further devolution to help Labour win back ground in Scotland in particular.\nSpeaking at a leadership hustings, she said: \u201cWhen we devolved power to Scotland and Wales they were never meant to be a satellite government with Westminster being the king and them being servile under the bottom. They were meant to be on an equal footing. That\u2019s what we need to push forward for.\n\u201cI\u2019m always going to argue for the union. But I want our Scottish parliament and our Welsh parliament to feel as completely autonomous and independent as they possibly can whilst having that collaborative relationship with Westminster. That\u2019s why we need to devolve real power \u2013 fiscal power, economic power and political power \u2013 to Wales and Scotland.\u201d\nShe gave the answer at an Open Labour event in which she appeared alongside Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry. Starmer was not present as he took the weekend off from campaigning because his mother-in-law had had an accident.\nThornberry, who is struggling to make it into the final round of the contest, took a robust tone on Scotland as she pledged to take on the SNP on the grounds of their incompetence rather than constitutional issues.\n\u201cI hate the SNP. I think they are Tories wrapped up in nationalist clothing,\u201d she said, to laughter and applause. \u201cThey\u2019re not on the left. If they were on the left, how would it be that children in Scotland were now falling behind children in England when it comes to education? They have been in power for 10 years and they are hiding behind constitutional issues and they need to be held to account.\u201d\nNandy said her approach would also be handing back more power to the regions and nations. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep treating Scotland like an afterthought in the Labour party,\u201d she said.\nStarmer is currently the favourite in the contest and has made it on to the final ballot alongside Nandy. Long-Bailey has to get one more trade union or affiliate, after Unite gave her their backing on Friday.\nIn a round of interviews, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said he would say \u201cgood riddance\u201d to any Labour MPs deciding to leave the party if Long-Bailey becomes leader. He praised Long-Bailey\u2019s \u201cbrains and brilliance\u201d and said he blamed Labour\u2019s election defeat \u201cvirtually solely\u201d on the party backing a second referendum on Brexit.\nThe first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u00a0 Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).\nThe second stage required each contender to win the support either of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs); or of three affiliates, two of which had to be unions, and which between them accounted for at least 5% of the affiliated membership. This had to be achieved before 14 February. Jess Phillips withdrew from the contest on 21 January. Emily Thornberry failed to attract the required number of members.\nThe ballot of members and registered supporters was due to open on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a \u00a325 registered supporter by 16 January.\nCorbyn\u2019s successor - Starmer, Long-Bailey or Nandy - will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.\nAsked about council leaders quoted in a Guardian article who said Long-Bailey was a \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate, McCluskey said there were \u201clots of these leaders who are anti-Corbyn, so of course they\u2019ll try to stick Rebecca with the same tags and that\u2019s deeply unfair of them.\u201d\nHe said it was Brexit that had dented Labour\u2019s popularity, not the leader, as Corbyn had been \u201cloved\u201d two years ago.\nMcCluskey also claimed there was no doubt that Corbyn\u2019s opponents \u201cused the antisemitism issue\u201d to undermine him, prompting criticism from some Labour MPs that he was failing to accept the depth of the problem.\nHe said he agreed that Labour had \u201cnever handled the antisemitism issue correctly\u201d, and he said he had no problem with acknowledging that \u201clots of people were genuinely concerned\u201d.\nHowever, he said there were \u201cothers who were disingenous\u201d and had acted in a \u201cdespicable\u201d way to undermine Corbyn\u2019s leadership.\nMcCluskey defended Richard Burgon and Dawn Butler, two deputy leadership candidates, over their refusal to sign up to a 10-point plan to tackle antisemitism published by the Board of Deputies of British Jews.\nThe party is preparing to receive the conclusions of an Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into its handling of antisemitism early this year.\nTwo Labour MPs, Catherine McKinnell and Wes Streeting, expressed disapproval at McCluskey\u2019s assessment of the situation. Streeting said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that those who dismissed antisemitism concerns as \u2018mood music\u2019 and sought to downplay, dismiss and delegitimatise concerns are part of the problem, not those of us who\u2019ve consistently challenged antisemitism.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-746": {"text": "sea level and the carbonate sand factory in south australia\n\"Stable parts of the South Australia coast show that the last interglacial sea level was 2m higher than present, but elsewhere there has been relative subsidence up to 7m and uplift of 18 m.

In stark contrast, low-carbon transport was put in the slow lane, getting \u00a31bn.\nWorse, Sunak flunked a golden opportunity to end the decade-long freeze on fuel duty that has pushed up traffic and pollution and suppressed bus and train travel. The oil price is now plummeting; even if the duty had been raised, drivers might not have seen any change in the price at the pump.\nTransport emissions are now the biggest contributor to the UK\u2019s carbon emissions and they are rising; 90% come from the roads.\nEmissions from transport are a key reason the government is on track to miss its own legally binding carbon targets.\nThe other key reason is the UK\u2019s terribly energy inefficient buildings, which lose heat up to three times as quickly as homes in neighbouring countries. Making homes cleaner, cosier, and cheaper to heat is a no-brainer. Yet there was not a single word on this in Sunak\u2019s speech or the 125-page budget document.\nThis failure really matters, with the UK hosting a crucial UN climate in just eight months\u2019 time. The summit \u2013 Cop26 in Glasgow \u2013 is a pledging party at which the world\u2019s nations must offer much bigger emissions cuts to head off the climate crisis. The host needs to start the party with a splashy pledge, but Sunak just tossed in a crumpled fiver found in a back pocket.\nThere will be more opportunities to show a lead before November, with the long-delayed national infrastructure plan, the comprehensive spending review and the Treasury\u2019s net zero review all to come.\nBut this is a year of consequences and the perennial problem of postponing serious climate action in the face of the latest short-term problem cannot continue, whether because of coronavirus or Brexit.\nThere were some green announcements in the budget, but they were nearer the bare minimum than world-leading. Flood defence spending was increased, but only after recent deluges and dire warnings of unpreparedness from the government\u2019s own advisers.\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) plants, where emissions from fossil fuels are trapped and buried, are likely to be very important in tackling the climate emergency and \u00a3800m is serious funding. But the dates for establishing two CCS sites \u2013 2025 and 2030 \u2013 are very late. Global emissions must already have halved by 2030 to avoid the worst climate impacts. The cancellation of the \u00a31bn CCS fund by the Conservatives in 2015 looks very shortsighted now.\n\u201cOver the next five years, we will plant around 30,000 hectares of trees,\u201d said Sunak, referring to part of the \u00a3640m over five years designated for a \u201cnature for climate\u201d fund to store carbon.\nBut the advice of the official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, is for 30,000 hectares each year, while the Green Alliance says \u00a3800m a year is needed to enhance natural habitats.\nThe plastic packaging tax, and cuts to red diesel subsidies, are sensible, but hardly transformative, and the latter is now riddled with loopholes.\nIn the \u00a31bn for clean transport was \u00a3500m to help build a network of rapid chargers for electric vehicles so that no one will be more than 30 miles from a charger. There was also \u00a3400m to partially reverse cuts in subsidies for plug-in electric cars. These are dabs on the brake of carbon emissions.\nBut the fact that the UK will not ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles until 2035 \u2013 later than other nations \u2013 plus the real-terms price cut for fuel and the extraordinary road building bonanza is stamping on the accelerator.\nSunak said that, as well as dealing with coronavirus, the budget \u201cwas a plan for prosperity tomorrow\u201d.\nThe only prosperous future is zero carbon, but drawing the roadmap to get there requires tough choices \u2013 above all ruling out policies that lock in emissions.\nOnce again, the government has been waylaid by diversions of political expediency.

But grinding out a political memoir shouldn\u2019t be an entirely painless process \u2013 the best involve an honest reckoning with mistakes as well as the inevitable recital of triumphs.\nSome of the most interesting recent political autobiographies come from those who might have led their parties but never did, and thus are less obsessed with creating legacies.

The only solution, Climate Crisis, Inc. insists, is to eliminate the oil, coal and natural gas that provide 80% of the energy that makes US and global economies, health and living standards possible.\nFailing that, CCI demands steadily increasing taxes on carbon-based fuels and carbon dioxide emissions.\nHowever, as France\u2019s Yellow Vest protests and the latest climate confab in Poland demonstrated, the world is not prepared to go down that dark path. Countries worldwide are expanding their reliable fossil fuel use, and families do not want to reduce their living standards or their aspirations for better lives.\nMoreover, climate computer model forecasts are completely out of touch with real-world observations. There is no evidence to support claims that the slight temperature, climate and weather changes we\u2019ve experienced are dangerous, unprecedented or caused by humans, instead of by the powerful solar, oceanic and other natural forces that have driven similar or far more serious changes throughout history.\nMore importantly, the CCI \u201csolutions\u201d would cause unprecedented disruption of modern industrialized societies; permanent poverty and disease in poor countries; and serious ecological damage worldwide.\nNothing that is required to harness breezes and sunshine to power civilization is clean, green, renewable, climate-friendly or sustainable. Tens of billions of tons of rock would have to be removed, to extract billions of tons of ores, to create millions of tons of metals, concrete and other materials, to manufacture millions of wind turbines and solar panels, and install them on millions of acres of wildlife habitats \u2013 to generate expensive, intermittent energy that would be grossly insufficient for humanity\u2019s needs. Every step in this process requires fossil fuels \u2013 and some of the mining involves child labor.\nHow do CCI alarmists respond to these points? They don\u2019t. They refuse to engage in or even permit civil discussion.

Chesapeake Energy gave the Club $26 million in three years to promote natural gas and attack coal. Ten wealthy liberal foundations gave another $51 million over eight years to the Club and other environmentalist groups to battle coal.\nOver a 12-year period, the Environmental Protection Agency gave its 15 Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee members $181 million in grants \u2013 and in exchange received quick rubberstamp approvals of various air quality rules. It paid the American Lung Association $20 million to support its regulations.\nDuring the Obama years, the EPA, Interior Department and other federal agencies paid environmental pressure groups tens of millions in collusive, secretive sue-and-settle lawsuit payoffs on dozens of issues.\nThen we get to the really big money: taxpayer funds that government agencies hand out to scientists, computer modelers and pressure groups \u2013 to promote global warming and climate change alarmism.\nAs Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore noted recently, citing government and other reports:\n* Federal funding for climate change research, technology, international assistance, and adaptation has increased from $2.4 billion in 1993 to $11.6 billion in 2014, with an additional $26.1 billion for climate change programs and activities provided by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n* The Feds spent an estimated $150 billion on climate change and green energy subsidies during President Obama\u2019s first term.\n* That didn\u2019t include the 30% tax credits/subsidies for wind and solar power: $8 billion to $10 billion a year \u2013 plus billions more from state programs that require utilities to buy expensive \u201cgreen\u201d energy.\n* Worldwide, according to the \u201cprogressive\u201d Climate Policy Initiative, climate change \u201cinvestment\u201d in 2013 totaled $359 billion \u2013 but this \u201cfalls far short\u201d of the $5 trillion per year that\u2019s actually needed.\nThe UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change echoes those greedy demands. It says the world must spend $2.4 trillion per year for the next 17 years to subsidize the transition to renewable energy.\nBear in mind that $1.5 trillion per year was already being spent in 2014 on Climate Crisis, Inc. research, consulting, carbon trading and renewable projects, according to the Climate Change Business Journal. With 6-8% annual growth, we\u2019re easily looking at a $2-trillion-per-year climate industry by now.\nThe US Government Accountability Office puts United States taxpayer funding alone at $2.1 billion per year for climate change \u201cscience\u201d \u2026 $9.0 billion a year for technology R&D \u2026 and $1.8 billion a year for international assistance.

Sea Change Foundation co-founder Nat Simons made it clear that this \u201cis only a down payment\u201d!\nAnd I get pilloried for working with organizations that received $41,571 to $59,728 per year from fossil fuel interests \u2026 questioning claims that fossil fuels are causing climate chaos \u2026 and raising inconvenient facts and questions about wind, solar and biofuel replacements for coal, oil and natural gas.\nJust as outrageous, tens of millions of dollars are squandered every year to finance \u201cstudies\u201d that supposedly show \u201csurging greenhouse gases\u201d and \u201cmanmade climate change\u201d are creating dangerous hybrid puffer fish, causing salmon to lose their ability to detect danger, making sharks right-handed and unable to hunt, increasing the number of animal bites, and causing US cities to be overrun by rats.\nLet\u2019s apply the Greenpeace-DeSmogBlog-Climate Crisis, Inc. standard all these organizations and researchers.

In each game, you can either control your player alone or their entire team. There are playable scenarios from famous real-life games, and a welter of editing tools that let you design your own custom competitions, bats and cricket grounds.\nIt looks basic in comparison with better resourced sports games such as Fifa, but at least its licensed players recognisably resemble their real-life counterparts. An official licence for the Ashes covers all the England and Australia men\u2019s and women\u2019s players, but players from all other countries have fictional names and random faces.\nIf you can get past the visuals, Cricket 19 impresses on the pitch. Its control system is exemplary, offering fine control and all the funky deliveries and shots that any bowler or batsman could desire. You can choose between button-based batting, and waggling analogue sticks in a manner that\u2019s vaguely suggestive of real cricketing. In a first for a cricket game, the AI is decent, too. Computer-controlled batsmen play to match conditions, exercising caution at the start of a 50-over innings, for example, before teeing off later on, bringing increased opportunities for your bowlers to strike.\nThe game launched with at least one egregious bug, but happily it\u2019s been fixed.

A pin from a grenade was among the detritus found by the new occupants as they have cleaned up the complex.\nThe Met told the Guardian that the building had been used for \u201cimportant firearms training\u201d, which has since had to be rescheduled.

Elsewhere, external doors were barricaded to thwart attempts at eviction.

Him. Scruton. Now Andrew Sabisky, the professional superforecaster who failed to superforecast that his provocative statements about, among other things, sex, women and eugenics would provoke people. Do we add, to this distinguished list, Labour\u2019s own supercreep, Jared O\u2019Mara? Naz Shah, exposed by Guido Fawkes? Probably not, since Conservatives are, you gather, infinitely more at risk from their own words. Unless, obviously, they\u2019re Boris Johnson.\nThe threat to lower-\u02c6status conservatives arrives, we learn, when they are widely read, thanks to a process of quotation that Young and his sympathisers have renamed, in a phrase intended to stop this nuisance, \u201coffence archaeology\u201d. And other than featuring living people, the redefinition of historical as worryingly recent, and the focus on finds that were actively designed to be discovered by as many people as possible, the comparison with conventional archaeology could scarcely be more apt.\nNot that the activity is new. Long before social media, and even outside provocateur circles, ostensibly blameless people were targeted by recruiters whose word for this form of investigation was, historically, vetting.\n\u201cThe media hysteria about my old stuff online is mad,\u201d Sabisky tweeted.\nIf only Sabisky had been applying to be, say, a fast-track civil servant, someone might still have stumbled on his various leavings and \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 wondered what, if it wasn\u2019t limitless exceptionalism, could have induced a serious applicant not to do a clean-up. It seems the likeliest explanation. \u201cThe media hysteria about my old stuff online is mad,\u201d Sabisky tweeted.\nEven Young, after people wondered about the fit between higher education work and the sort of middle-aged man who tweets: \u201cWomen who display a lot of cleavage shouldn\u2019t then complain when men notice them\u201d (2013), conceded his comments were \u201csophomoric and silly\u201d. Only later was their circulation repurposed as a free speech moment, a grim warning for all salaried public officials claiming the right to openly perv, sorry, challenge \u201cthe liberal-left consensus\u201d.\nBut you can see why Young might feel sore. His exceptionalism \u2013 with the help, for once, of social media \u2013 did public life a favour. What will happen when individuals like him and Sabisky, pausing to consider the perspective of people they would probably consider genetically disadvantaged, become more cunning? The next Cummings misfit may already have deleted similar evidence. With vetting clearly abandoned inside Downing Street, the more of this archaeology \u2013 or reading \u2013 the better. It\u2019s only, after all, because Cummings, convinced of his superiority, leaves his rambling, stream-of-consciousness blogs open to view that we can be sure the country is now being run by a man, some of whose preoccupations can disconcertingly recall those of the late Jeffrey Epstein.\nTrue, at least one similarity is glaring. The way Cummings signals his maverick dominance via jeans, hoodies and insultingly sloppy dress finds a parallel in his fellow blogger Epstein and his preference for Harvard hoodies and jeans, even with eminent individuals he planned to befriend. Epstein quit a university board, it was reported, \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t like to wear a suit to meetings\u201d.\nBut anyone who has ever spent time on Cummings\u2019s blog and Epstein\u2019s various websites must have noticed a shared habit of scientist-name dropping, a shared interest in AI, genomics and eugenics, and an unfortunate habit, in both cases, of undermining this effortful scholarship with schoolboy showing-off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my natural bent,\u201d Epstein said, \u201cto move towards the maverick and people who don\u2019t fit in.\u201d\nElaborating on the fab time that he \u2013 a layman! \u2013 had mixing with geniuses at a conference where subjects included genetically altered astronauts and bringing Neanderthals to life, Cummings shares, for example, his interest in the Harvard biologist George Church, creator of a potentially IQ-enhancing, genome-editing tool. Church has become yet more familiar since then for associating with another fan, Epstein, when the latter was a registered sex offender. \u201cThere was just a lot of nerd tunnel vision,\u201d Church explained.\nWhen not raping girls, Epstein liked to socialise with pet scientists, having them round, offering money, banging on about genetics and IQ, including a scheme to populate the world, via sex slaves, with an Epstein master race. He favoured, one interviewer concluded, researchers who \u201cfit the old stereotype of scientists whose brilliance makes them social outcasts\u201d. Not, perhaps, unlike the individuals to whom Cummings referred, in his \u201cweirdos and misfits with odd skills\u201d recruitment drive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my natural bent,\u201d Epstein said, \u201cto move towards the maverick and people who don\u2019t fit in.\u201d\nJust occasionally, Epstein\u2019s brains became aware of passing female accessories. To a Vanity Fair profiler, in 2003, the late Murray Gell-Mann, discoverer of the quark \u2013 \u201crather sweetly mentions that \u2018there are always pretty ladies around\u2019 when he goes to dinner chez Epstein\u201d. Gell-Mann invented \u201cOdyssean Education\u201d, a system alleged, chez Cummings, who named a pamphlet and his Twitter account after it, \u201cto focus on humans\u2019 biggest and most important problems and explain connections between them to train synthesisers\u201d.\nSince one social media detectorist\u2019s ugly discoveries will strike another as priceless synthesis, Cummings\u2019s echoes of Epstein will probably look as unremarkable to some as the same blog\u2019s overwrought abuse (\u201cmetastising tumour\u201d), its fondness for Nietsche. To Boris Johnson, Young offered the country \u201ccaustic wit\u201d. But without the caustic wit/offence archaeology, how would we know?

The other 30% had begun to decline as people stayed home and private hospitals responded to calls to save dwindling supplies of protective equipment for urgent cases.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of between a rock and a hard place when our revenue has been cancelled on us without notice,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the states and other providers and us will get an other arrangement in place promptly, but if this doesn\u2019t happen soon what we have seen [with staff being stood down] in the last few days will be a small impact compared with what we will see in the next week once elective surgery stops completely.\u201d\nAtkins\u2019s statement was supported in a joint statement by the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Catholic Health Australia and Day Hospitals Australia.\nThe groups called on the states and territories to deal with concerns raised by the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, as part of a national coronavirus partnership on Wednesday, and guarantee the viability of the private sector in return for a guarantee all hospitals would be geared to treat the virus.\nMichael Roff, from the Australian Private Hospitals Association, said negotiations with states and territories had been fragmented. \u201cThe states don\u2019t seem to understand the urgency of reaching a deal this weekend. If they don\u2019t do that the beds they need in a few weeks\u2019 time may no longer be available,\u201d he said.\nThe Catholic Health Association\u2019s Pat Garcia said all hospitals should be using the time before the \u201cfull coronavirus onslaught\u201d to train existing clinical staff and hire additional staff. \u201cHospitals cannot simply close down entire wards and ICUs then turn them back on at the flick of a switch,\u201d he said.\nHunt said the national cabinet, made up of the prime minister, state premiers and territory chief ministers, had committed on Friday to urgently finalising agreements with private hospitals to ensure they had \u201csufficient and viable\u201d capacity during the pandemic and once it was over.\nHe said it was an \u201castonishing breach of faith\u201d that a private health provider would let nurses go at a critical time of need. \u201cI urge the state and territory governments to complete whole-of-sector agreements with the private hospital sector in the timeframes agreed at national cabinet,\u201d Hunt said.\nBrett Holmes, general secretary of the NSW Nurses and Midwives\u2019 Association, estimated more than 600 nurses across the state had been stood down since Thursday night and hundreds more could follow. He accused the federal government of bungling the announcement of the elective surgery ban.\nThe government announced on Wednesday that all non-urgent surgery except for category 1 (operations classified as required within 30 days) and urgent category 2 (procedures required within 90 days) would be postponed from midnight that day.\nThe start of the ban was later pushed to 1 April. Holmes said the biggest private operator, Ramsay Health Care, stopped non-urgent surgery on Friday.\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to have been a lot of forethought of the consequences of sending people on leave and laying them off and, when the shit has hit the fan in four weeks\u2019 time, relying on them coming back into what will be a pretty daunting situation,\u201d Holmes said.\nThe Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the state was working to secure an agreement. \u201cThe private healthcare sector in Victoria has, and will continue to be, an important and integral component of Victoria\u2019s healthcare system.\u201d she said.\nA NSW Health spokeswoman said it was talking to private hospital operators \u201cfocusing on how private hospitals can help support the health system with their facilities and workforce\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-761": {"text": "Syria confirms first Covid-19 case amid fears of catastrophic spread\nAfter weeks of denials from officials in Damascus, Syria has confirmed its first case of Covid-19, as fears mount of an outbreak that will have catastrophic consequences on the war-torn country.\nThe patient is a 20-year-old woman who recently returned to Syria from an unspecified country and appropriate measures have been taken, the health minister Nizar Yaziji said.\nThe announcement came after insistence by the regime that Iran-backed fighters and Shia pilgrims had not already brought the coronavirus to Syria, despite reports from healthcare workers in the capital that patients have presented with symptoms consistent with Covid-19.\nNine years of war have devastated Syria\u2019s infrastructure, economy and healthcare system.

The WHO estimates deaths from diabetes will increase to 2.4 million in 2030 and 3.7 million in 2045.\nDiabetes is a disease in which the body is unable to regulate blood sugar. Patients with type 1 diabetes can\u2019t produce insulin in the pancreas due to an auto-immune disease, while those with type 2, once called adult-onset \u2013 as it often develops in later life \u2013 no longer produce insulin because of issues such as excessive body weight and insufficient exercise. It\u2019s estimated that type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95% of cases worldwide.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through Global Health Progress, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease.\nBut what\u2019s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that \u201cthe dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition. It needs to take in issues such as a lack of trained health practitioners, inadequate supply chains and weak health systems in developing countries.\u201d\n\u201cAccess is a complex issue,\u201d says Helen McGuire, programme leader, noncommunicable diseases at global health organisation Path. \u201cFailures of access in low-resource settings are rarely due to a single cause.\n\u201cBarriers must be addressed by leveraging multi-sectoral partnerships, which bring the unique expertise and resources of governments, non-profits, and industry to the table. Solutions require a long-term approach addressing issues of quality, affordability, availability, acceptability, and sustainability.\u201d\nEmma Klatman is a health systems specialist at the international diabetes charity Life for a Child, which is tackling type 1 diabetes in low and middle income countries, where mortality rates among young people are especially high.\nLiving without treatment can have horrific consequences, she says, and young people are faced with \u201cblindness, losing limbs, developing kidney problems, and they just remain chronically unwell. They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.\u201d\nThe charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes.\nIt\u2019s a point echoed by McGuire. \u201cSelf-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes \u2013 therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,\u201d she says. \u201cCo-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.\u201d\nNext year is the centenary of insulin\u2019s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.\nThe first insulin pen was introduced in 1985 and immediately improved the accuracy of treatment. Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R&D into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones.\nSanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively.\nWorking with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day.\nLooking at the economics of diabetes, Novo Nordisk\u2019s Base of the Pyramid programme in Kenya addresses the many barriers to diabetes care faced by people on low incomes. It takes on board issues such as poverty, geography and gender, as well as the limitations of national health systems. Cost of transport, having to miss a day\u2019s work and the need to buy equipment such as syringes are also flagged up.\nThrough working in partnerships across the supply chain, one of its successes has been a 75% reduction in the price of insulin. But, explains Soraya Ramoul, Novo Nordisk\u2019s director of global access to care, the programme also showed that the price reduction in itself does not provide people with access to good care. \u201cDiabetes is a complex condition, which requires a systemic approach to ensure basic quality care and management,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAffordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.\u201d\nKlatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families \u201care able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive\u201d.", "label": 0}, "text-764": {"text": "Could Microsoft\u2019s climate crisis \u2018moonshot\u2019 plan really work?\nMicrosoft drew widespread praise in January this year after Brad Smith, the company\u2019s president, announced their climate \u201cmoonshot\u201d.\nWhile other corporate giants, such as Amazon and Walmart, were pledging to go carbon neutral, Microsoft vowed to go carbon negative by 2030, meaning they would be removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they produced.\nBy 2050, Smith added, the company was aiming to remove all of the carbon they had ever emitted since being founded in 1975.\nThe firm\u2019s promises won plaudits from conservationists and climate conscious Microsoft employees, but also attracted big questions: how are they going to actually deliver this?\nMuch of its plans lean on nascent technology. Critics, meanwhile, see the move as a gamble aimed at justifying Microsoft\u2019s ongoing deals with fossil fuel firms.\nMicrosoft releases less carbon a year than Amazon and Apple, but more than Google. The company has 150,000 employees across offices in more than 100 countries, and is still focused on developing the software and consumer electronics that made them a household name \u2013 Windows, PCs, Xbox. But after a temporary slump following their heyday in the 1990s, they have also once again become innovators, developing world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing products.\nThe company hopes to bring that innovative approach to its climate policies, in part by widening how it calculates its carbon footprint, beyond most corporate responsibility plans. Historically, Microsoft has only counted those emissions that fall within the scope of their own business operations \u2013 employee travel, company vehicles, heat and electricity in company buildings, and so on.\nFrom now on, it plans to take responsibility for the emissions produced by its entire supply chain, including the full lifespan of the products it makes and the electricity that customers may consume when using its products.\nMeanwhile, increasing the scrutiny on Microsoft\u2019s plan are its dealings with fossil fuel companies, which have been highlighted by some as evidence of hypocrisy as it makes climate pledges. In 2019 alone, the technology company had entered into long-term partnerships with three major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, that will be using Microsoft\u2019s technology to expand oil production by as much as 50,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The staggering amount of carbon this would release into the atmosphere would not be included on Microsoft\u2019s expanded carbon ledger.\nIt will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps\nFor Microsoft, however, partnering with oil companies is not considered hypocritical. The company is hedging its climate bets on carbon capture and removal technologies that they believe will be able to offset some of the environmental harm caused by fossil fuels during the transition to a more sustainable future, despite such technologies being still in their nascent stages and not yet proven to work at scale.\nThose who devised the plan at Microsoft argue that they are responding directly to a new reality: cutting emissions is not enough and all routes to non-catastrophic temperature increase will also require removing carbon from the atmosphere. So, as well as shifting to a 100% supply of renewable energy for all of their data centers, buildings and campuses by 2025, Microsoft outlines a number of carbon reduction methods it is backing to try and hit its bold targets.\nTo begin, Microsoft will focus on protecting forests and planting trees to capture carbon. This strategy has long been used to offset emissions, but Microsoft is hoping to improve their outcomes by using remote-sensing technology to accurately estimate the carbon storage potential of forests to ensure no major deforestation is occurring in their allotments. To achieve these goals, Microsoft will be partnering with Pachama, a Silicon Valley startup that will survey 60,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon, plus an additional 20,000 hectares across north-eastern states of the US for the company.\nAccording to Kesley Perlman, a climate campaigner at the forest conservation NGO Fern, Microsoft\u2019s commitment to hi-tech reforestation is encouraging, but she stressed that conservation is a complex, multifaceted process that goes beyond technical issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about how much carbon a forest can hold but also who traditionally uses the forest, how they might be kept out, and how biodiversity will be prioritized,\u201d she said. \nMicrosoft will initially focus on nature-based solutions to reduce their carbon footprint over the next five or so years. But in order to start drawing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit by 2030, it will need to shift to technology-based solutions that can scale up and accelerate carbon removal.\nTo this end, Microsoft is betting on biomass energy carbon capture storage, otherwise known as BECCS, to transform how energy is generated. Instead of burning coal, a BECCS power plant burns biomass, like wood chips. The carbon produced when burning the biomass is captured before it is released into the atmosphere and then injected at a very high pressure into rock formations deep underground. Not only does this remove carbon from the natural cycle, the biomass absorbs CO2 as it grows.\nA world powered by biofuel, however, raises two looming questions. First, scientists are not yet certain if biomass energy will be carbon neutral.\nThe second concern is that the transition from coal to biofuel would require setting aside vast tracts of arable land \u2013 some estimates say one to two times the size of India. According to climate campaigner Perlman this would mean that the energy industry would probably have to compete with food production in a world where 10 billion people will need to be fed, while vastly enlarging industrialized plantations and reducing biodiversity. \u201cWe would likely see massive land use change and massive private purchases of land, the knock on impacts of which could be quite dangerous,\u201d she said.\nPerhaps the most futuristic of the technologies outlined in Microsoft\u2019s carbon negative plan is direct air capture (DAC). This involves machines that essentially function like highly efficient artificial trees, drawing existing carbon out of the air and transforming it into non-harmful carbon-based solids or gasses.\nWhile the image of air-conditioner-like machines sucking carbon out of the air is captivating, capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere requires a lot of energy and is very expensive. In 2011, extracting carbon from the air cost $600 a ton of CO2. In 2018, estimates brought this down to anywhere between $94 to $232 a ton. But given that Microsoft expects to emit 16m metric tons of carbon this year, if they were to reach carbon zero using only DAC, their bill might cost as much as $3.5bn.\nAccording to Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, a large part of the reason why carbon removal remains so expensive is because the markets around these technologies are still immature. The company\u2019s strategy over the coming decades is maturing these markets through intensive and directed investment. \u201cWe\u2019re making a bet on certain technologies that don\u2019t exist at the scale or price point we need them to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we want to get them, we need to start investing.\u201d\nThe company, he said, already has a model for raising funds internally to support climate innovation. In July 2012, Microsoft became one of the first companies to institute an internal carbon price, charging different divisions in the business $15 a metric ton of carbon emitted. The funds raised were then used to pay for sustainability improvements, which helped the company achieve their goal of going carbon neutral.\nPreviously, this carbon price only extended over emissions Microsoft was directly responsible for. According to their new plan, in July this year Microsoft will extend this internal carbon price over emissions produced across direct and indirect emissions. The increased revenue raised from the expanded internal carbon tax, along with a $1bn climate innovation fund, will be used to invest in capture and removal technology. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is put this money in the market in a way that is highly additional,\u201d Joppa said. \u201cThis is how we\u2019re going to get nature-based solutions and tech solutions at a price point and scale we need.\u201d\n Microsoft\u2019s plan for intensive investment in this industry is exciting for those working in the field. Klaus Lackner, a theoretical physicist working on DAC, has been arguing since the 1990s that carbon removal is the only feasible way to stop significant temperature rises. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that this method is technologically feasible, but nobody has wanted them,\u201d he said. \u201cMicrosoft have said \u2018we get it\u2019. It will cost them money, but it will allow the technologies to come online and for the next company to follow their footsteps.\u201d\nWhile the technologies that Microsoft are betting on are still in their nascent stages, in the past few years there has been some encouraging progress in the negative emissions industry. Lackner and Arizona State University recently signed a deal with Silicon Kingdom, an Irish-based company, to manufacture his carbon-suck machines. The plan is to install them on wind and solar farms, and then sell the captured carbon to beverage companies to make carbonated drinks. In the UK, Drax power plant, which was once among Europe\u2019s most polluting, transitioned from coal to biofuel this year.\nBut many attempts at scaling carbon negative projects have also failed. The Kemper Project in Mississippi, which was billed as America\u2019s flagship carbon capture project, was abandoned in 2017 \u2013 it was $5bn over budget, three years late and still not operational.\nGiven the not insignificant risk of failure, some propose that relying on nascent or future technology as a solution to the climate crisis represents a moral hazard \u2013 the promise of carbon removal functions as an incentive for governments and major polluters to not change their behavior now.\nIt\u2019s extremely hard to lead if there\u2019s no one there to follow\nAccording to Chris Adams, a tech worker who organizes an online community of technology professionals agitating for climate action from within the industry, the fact that Microsoft is still partnering with big oil companies demonstrates the moral hazard in action. \u201cThey are protecting the fossil fuel industry from changing while the rest of the world will pay most from this gamble if it fails in the long term,\u201d he said.\nAdams added that many of the encouraging ideas around carbon reduction in Microsoft\u2019s plan have come from internal organizing from concerned employees, but that this mostly goes unacknowledged in Microsoft\u2019s official vision. Emphasizing future technology while overlooking activism in the present, Adams said, represents a certain way of approaching problems that is typical of technology companies. \u201cIf you have spent the last 10 years amassing influence by approaching most problems with technology it\u2019s understandable you see all problems through this lens, particularly if you don\u2019t have to have conversations about power,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked about this concern by the Guardian, Microsoft\u2019s Joppa responded that in the short term, the energy demands of a growing global population will probably still need a mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. By remaining in discourse with these industries, he said, Microsoft hopes to help them change and transition to a better model in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to lead if there\u2019s no one there to follow,\u201d he added.\nAs to whether the technology outlined in their plan will scale, he said there is inherent risk, but this is why they call it a \u201cmoonshot\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to our plan it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got it all figured out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to do what the science says the whole world needs to do. There\u2019s really no other choice.\u201d\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

And in 2019 I am resolutely, unfashionably, not politically homeless.\nEveryone is, these days. Can\u2019t throw a brick without hitting someone saying: \u201cUgh, there\u2019s no choice at all, it\u2019s like picking between being two different ways of being murdered.\u201d This election, depending on which paper you read, is either a desperate fight to save the Queen from being murdered by John McDonnell at 9am on 13 December, or a deeply dull and unpleasant affair which Your Humble Correspondent finds themselves unfortunately caught up in through no fault of their own, like someone sent out to cover an arts festival in Azerbaijan who ends up accidentally reporting on a scandal involving a dodgy sewage works.\nYou would barely be able to tell, reading the output of the \u2018politically homeless\u2019, that the levels of actual, literal homelessness in this country are at truly catastrophic levels. Shelter says that 135,000 children will be homeless on Christmas Day, with current trends meaning that 4,000 children will become newly homeless between now and Christmas. The evidence of our own eyes tells us that real homelessness is a huge problem on our streets, but \u201chidden\u201d homelessness \u2013 precarious accommodation, and people living in substandard, crowded houses rotting with mildew \u2013 is all too common. We are failing at being a society, the social fabric frays around us, yet a substantial chunk of the commentariat is somehow bored.\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve never felt rejected by the political process. I remember the 2010 election very well, facing the dismal offer of Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. In the Red corner: the guy who\u2019d been chancellor during the Blair years, overseeing a strategy of funding growth by overleveraging an asset bubble, and building detention camps while ramping up officially sanctioned Islamophobia. In the Blue corner: a shiny-faced Bullingdon Club nonentity offering to increase the beatings until morale improved. Times were so grim that Nick Clegg \u2013 Nick Clegg for God\u2019s sake! \u2013 looked like a breath of fresh air.\nNine years can give you a hell of a perspective though. Take me back in a time machine now, and I\u2019d be hollering at everyone I could see: \u201cVote for Brown, the other two are much worse than you think!\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be happy about it \u2013 I have no real faith that the unadventurous economic programme he put on offer would have done much, except just be better than the alternative.

I\u2019ve seen how the \u201chostile environment\u201d has ripped families apart. I\u2019ve seen the Department for Work and Pensions transformed so that it no longer even pretends to be a social security agency, fully embracing its role to punish the poor and disabled until they get work or die trying. I\u2019ve seen the flattening of wages and the grinding drop in working standards which slowly turns this country into a meaner and grimmer place to live.\nTo sit above it all in 2019 feels incomprehensible. Yes, Labour remains a deeply flawed vehicle for reform. Its manifesto offer, as radical as it is compared with the status quo, is in many ways still insufficient to fully reverse the long-term damage that has been inflicted on our society. But the big question \u2013 what kind of country do we want to be? \u2013 has two distinct and contrasting answers this election.\nDo we want to be a nation of underpaid, overworked, suspicious, angry people? Or do we want to try something else? Do we want to choose a society that invests in itself, which sees homelessness and poverty as a moral problem to be solved? Do we want to do something about the climate crisis, or hunker down and buy more barbed wire?\nTo cling to the slim, tentative, ephemeral hope offered by Labour is an exercise in ongoing heartbreak and doubt. I know that even the best outcome is for years of struggle and constant setback. And yet the mere chance that there could be people in government who want to try to build a better society is enough.\nI would love to be capable of fashionable cynicism, I honestly would. It\u2019s the hope that kills you, after all. This election is making me sleepless and sick with worry. I am tired, and it is cold, and I want to get on with Christmas. But the circumstances of our lives do not design themselves according to what we find convenient and unchallenging.\nI wonder how bad it has to get out there, how much more actual homelessness there has to be, before political homelessness starts to feel as detached and callous as it looks from the outside?\n\u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy", "label": 0}, "text-766": {"text": "The big smoke: political inaction on climate change is adding to our suffocating atmosphere\nMore than once in the last few weeks I have woken with the fleeting fear my house is on fire.\nThe unprecedented, severe early fire season devouring great swathes of bushland up and down Australia\u2019s east coast has sent rolling waves of bushfire smoke across Sydney. It has been seeping through open windows and into air-conditioning systems, clinging to hanging washing and the backs of our throats, shrouding the tops of buildings and obliterating views.\nLife here is going on, but things feel and smell different.\nLocal health authorities repeatedly warn people to avoid outdoor exertion as the smoke pushes the air quality into \u201chazardous\u201d territory over and over. My friends tell me their kids are being brought indoors at daycare, where they have to find age-appropriate ways to talk about bushfires, because the topic has become unavoidable. Other friends who haven\u2019t needed an inhaler since childhood are using them again for the first time in decades. Sydney Instagram is awash with red moons, brown skylines and nervous apocalypse jokes. Hospital presentations for respiratory problems have spiked.\nOn a particularly smoky day, the radio announcer interrupts the umpteenth Post Malone song to warn people about the dangerous haze. \u201cIf you\u2019re driving out there guys, turn your lights on,\u201d he said. I did. It was 11am. Delivery riders on bicycles weaving precariously through the traffic pass by my car window, wearing ineffectual-looking masks over their faces. At city beaches, ash is washing up on the shore.\n We\u2019ve always had devastating fires of course, and smoky days in Sydney, but in a changing climate, with warmer weather and less rain, the intensity is ratcheting up.\nIt is, as ever, rural and regional Australia that has borne the heaviest costs of this crisis \u2013 in lives, homes and the gruelling labour. But perhaps these past few weeks will be a particular turning point for those in the city, who often only watch these crisis from a sympathetic distance. We now find ourselves \u2013 though not in immediate peril \u2013 nonetheless breathing it in every day.\nCity limits won\u2019t hold out the reality of the natural world and its changing climate\nLiving in the city we can feel almost immune to the rhythms and changes of the natural world. We\u2019ve largely built our way out of its whims. Many of us live comfortably in air-conditioned offices and shopping centres through the sweltering summer, move about in brightly lit streets after dark, buy food and goods largely on demand, no matter what the season. Even if we know natural calamities are happening, we don\u2019t often feel it, see it or smell it.\nThese past few weeks have served as a stark reminder that none of us are immune. City limits won\u2019t hold out the reality of the natural world and its changing climate.\nIndeed, our cities are hugely vulnerable. Report after dizzying, terrifying report tells us that so many of the world\u2019s great metropolis, especially those built on coastlines, risk inundation in the face of rising sea levels. \n\u201cThe word \u2018apocalypse\u2019 derives from the Greek apokalypsis, which means \u2018something uncovered\u2019 or revealed,\u201d wrote Naomi Klein in her call to arms on climate change, This Changes Everything. That book was written in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the superstorm that killed more than 50 people and caused billions in damage to New York City and its surrounds .\nIn that case, Klein wrote, it showed how dangerous it was to be dependent on centralised forms of energy, the life-and-death cost of social isolation, and the huge risks that come from social inequality and poor housing.\nOne thing these past few weeks have revealed about Sydney is that it is not just our coast, but our clean air and the outdoor lifestyle we all take for granted that is at stake in a warming climate. Kids, the elderly, those with respiratory illnesses, and particularly those who depend on outdoor, manual jobs will be worst affected amid rising temperatures and increasingly hazardous air.\nIf periods like this become routine, could we become, as my colleague Brigid Delaney astutely wrote last summer during a heatwave, more like Dubai, a place where the wealthiest residents live a life mostly indoor, a \u201cclimate-controlled version\u201d of reality, while the rest suffer?\nThere is evidence of a political reckoning taking place \u2013 as polls point to people becoming increasingly worried about climate change. We no longer see it as a theoretical risk but a real, unfolding crisis. Cities may be vulnerable, but they\u2019re also home to our most valuable resource at the moment: increasingly large numbers of people who can push for change.\nYet there is no such evidence yet that urgency has blown in the direction of our political leaders, who continue to mock those raising alarm about climate change and refute the need for greater action. That inertia is only adding to the suffocating atmosphere.\nAt the beach last week, I lay on the rocky outcrops around Coogee with scores of others, baking like seals amid the heat and an acrid brown haze that stretched out towards New Zealand.\nNear me, a group of young women lit up a couple of cigarettes and passed them around.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t smoke here, it\u2019s not allowed,\u201d an older woman sitting nearby yelled in their direction. \u201cYou\u2019re polluting the air!\u201d\nThey laughed and kept on puffing. \u201cLook around,\u201d one retorted. \u201cWhy does it even matter?\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-767": {"text": "\u2018We all deserve representation': hijab-wearing model Halima Aden on the power of fashion\nHalima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend Carine Roitfeld. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of Vogue \u2013 twice (first Vogue Arabia, then British Vogue) \u2013 and soon afterwards a Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she\u2019d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on diversity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first TED talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. Teen Vogue went with her.\nWhen we meet, at a hotel near King\u2019s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. \u201cSomebody needs to,\u201d Aden says. \u201cI want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.\u201d We\u2019re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black \u2013 sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots \u2013 she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken.\nBut on the topics of diversity, representation and sustainability, she speaks with passion and conviction. She has said in the past that, growing up in the US: \u201cThe only times I saw somebody dressed like me was on CNN \u2013 and they weren\u2019t doing anything I approve of.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like we all deserve representation and I didn\u2019t have that,\u201d Aden says now. \u201cI never got to flip through a magazine and see somebody who looks like me.\u201d Lizeth digs out the latest issue of Essence magazine, Aden proud in pink on the cover. Aden takes it from her, somewhat wonderingly. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s so wild for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI still catch myself\u2026 When my friend went and got that from the newsstand, I was like: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d\nThe fact she has been able to have a global career in fashion at all is proof that the industry is increasingly open to diversity. Aden is 5ft 5in, petite for a model, and a resident of Minnesota, far from the industry capitals of New York, London, Paris or Milan. \u201cAnd the fact that I\u2019m able to do runway, the fact that I have graced these magazine covers and wear a hijab on top of that, be who I am, have my identity, wear it proudly\u2026 I think fashion is doing a beautiful job.\u201d\nAden now has her own 47-piece hijab collection, Halima x Modanisa, and her hijab is stipulated as non-negotiable in her contract with IMG. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of my identity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t think people are going to listen \u2013 it\u2019s more so they know what to expect. I always bring extras \u2013 my own set of turbans, turtlenecks, tights \u2013 because it\u2019s a collaboration. I also recognise that for a lot of people, in my first year especially, I was the only hijab-wearing girl they\u2019d worked with. So they\u2019re not going to necessarily know 100% what to expect, just like I didn\u2019t know what to expect with fashion, because it\u2019s not the world that I come from.\u201d\nShe does have certain requirements, such as a pop-up tent in which to change backstage at shows, but she says she\u2019s never been uncomfortably set apart, or made to feel othered. She remembers her experience of walking for Yeezy at New York fashion week in 2017, her breakout year, as a watershed moment. The first outfit she was presented with \u201cwas just not going to work,\u201d she says, gesturing above her knee \u2013 too short. \u201cEven then I knew: walking away when something doesn\u2019t fit is always better than feeling you need to force something.\u201d\nShe returned to her hotel, disappointed but resolute. \u201cAnd then, without having to say anything, they called back: \u2018We have a second option.\u2019 I tried it on and it was perfect. I just knew it was a pivotal moment in my life. The people who you want to work with, they\u2019re willing to work with you just the way you are.\u201d\nThat same year, Aden remembers walking for MaxMara at Milan fashion week in a look that had been designed with her in mind. When she posted it on Instagram, a woman commented: \u201cHe keeps you in mind, he keeps us in mind. Now this Muslim shopper will keep MaxMara in mind.\u201d Aden shared it with the brand. \u201cI was like \u2013 wink-wink-wink!\u201d\nIt led to an exclusive capsule collection in the Middle East, for which Aden was the face. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for designers when they\u2019re diverse; it\u2019s a win for the brand, it\u2019s a win for everybody \u2013 we all want to see a little piece of ourselves reflecting back.\u201d And it makes a difference, she says. The year after Aden became the first contestant to wear a hijab in Miss USA, there were seven others. Last year she was one of two hijabi models on the MaxMara catwalk in Milan, and one of three for her second Vogue Arabia cover.\nWhen Aden was seven, she used to pray for rain \u2013 the kind of torrential rain that would wash away her new home in the American Midwest. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Then our neighbours could come out and play,\u2019\u201d she says. Even the structure of her apartment building felt alienating. \u201cI was like, \u2018God, everybody is so isolated.\u2019\u201d\nAden was born a refugee in the United Nations Kakuma camp in northwestern Kenya, where her mother had fled the Somali civil war in 1994. There their house was made of mud, scraps, sticks \u2013 anything her mother could find. \u201cIt would be normal for me to go to nursery school, come back and find it had washed away,\u201d she says. But then the community would come together to rebuild it, \u201cand then it\u2019s the kids\u2019 time to play around.\u201d\nThe model remembers her childhood in the camp as being joyful and supportive. \u201cThere\u2019s no walls keeping you apart from your neighbour,\u201d she says. In her new home in Missouri, where she was relocated with her family in 2004, before moving to Minnesota, where they live today, the barriers stood strong.\n\u201cKakuma\u201d translates from Swahili as \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m like, \u2018I was born in the middle of nowhere,\u2019 people think I\u2019m joking,\u201d Aden says. \u201cBut if you actually look at Google Maps\u2026\u201d People tend to think of a refugee camp as being a temporary settlement. But Kakuma is \u201cmore of a city of its own,\u201d says Aden, in both permanence and size. Established by the UN in 1992 with a 70,000-person capacity, it has since ballooned to about 192,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority of whom are never resettled (the global figure is less than 1%).\nAs a child, Aden remembers thriving under the collective care of the community, which was two thirds women and children. She was bright \u2013 she spoke Somali and Swahili, sometimes translating for the grown-ups \u2013 and popular, roaming the camp with up to 30 playmates of mixed ages and ethnicities. (\u201cIf you could keep up, you were in the group.\u201d)\nAden is well aware that her happy stories of childhood challenge the stereotype of the \u201ctragic refugee\u201d, though she credits her mother with working hard to shield her young family from hardship. Aden never knew her father. He was lost during the Somali civil war, and assumed dead by her mother; he made contact after they had moved to the US, but died before Aden could develop a relationship. \u201cIt was both the scars and the smiles,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a happy childhood and also, we lived in uncertainty.\u201d\nSymbolic of this limbo was a noticeboard that was updated with the names and destinations of those lucky few bound for resettlement. Aden remembers it as larger than life, \u201clike something out of The Hunger Games\u201d: \u201cIt would control your entire future \u2013 it was literally the difference between life and death. For parents it meant a brand new life: \u2018We\u2019re starting over, we won the lottery.\u2019 But for the kids it is: \u2018I\u2019m never seeing my friends again\u2019.\u201d\nAnother common misconception of being a refugee, Aden says, \u201cis that you get a say where you go\u201d. Her family were relocated to a poverty-stricken, crime-rife neighbourhood in St Louis, Missouri, which \u2013 compared to the \u201cnurturing\u201d community of Kakuma \u2013 came as a shock. That was when she felt most isolated, when she wished for her house to wash away. It was the first time she\u2019d heard gunshots. \u201cBut nonetheless, did I have the fear of malaria? No \u2013 so, in a way, it was like trading one obstacle for another.\u201d\nThe biggest hurdle was learning English: Aden\u2019s school in St Louis did not have an English language programme. After two weeks of presenteeism, Aden recalls her mother asking her to read some written English aloud. \u201cI literally started mouthing the words to Dilemma\u201d \u2013 rapper Nelly and Kelly Rowland\u2019s syrupy duet, which she knew from the radio. Aden mimics a haltering recital: \u201c\u2018No matt-er. Whatido. All I think about. Is you\u2019 \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t stand the idea of disappointing her.\u201d\nEventually Aden\u2019s mother decided to relocate the family to St Cloud, Minnesota, where they found a community like the one that they had left at the camp. At first they were heavily reliant on it, living on food stamps and even, for six months, in a women\u2019s shelter. Aden remembers the kindness of neighbours, taking the family to the grocery store during the punishing winters, giving her mother lifts when she couldn\u2019t drive. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so loyal,\u201d she says. \u201cI love my state.\u201d She lives in St Paul now, closer to the airport, but only 40 minutes from her mother, who\u2019s still in St Cloud. Minnesota is known for high taxes, but Aden says she is happy to pay them. \u201cI relied on welfare when I was little... I think of it as my way of paying back.\u201d\nBefore we meet, Aden\u2019s team is adamant that I don\u2019t ask her about Trump or US politics, so instead I ask her how superficial diversity in fashion tallies with a more fractious, divided world.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even really avoid politics,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve needed in order to connect with people. Once I share my story, there\u2019s always some common ground. It doesn\u2019t have to be: \u2018I grew up in a refugee camp.\u2019 I get just as many messages, believe it or not, from parents who are not Muslim, who are not black, who say, \u2018Thank you for making modesty look cool and young\u2019.\u201d\nWhen she entered the Miss Minnesota USA pageant in 2016, as a freshman at St Cloud State University, Aden told local media that she wanted to represent Muslim women and counter the image that they were oppressed. \u201cThe hijab is a symbol we wear on our heads,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want people to know that it is my choice.\u201d Today she says her motivations for entering were less lofty. \u201cCollege tuition is expensive in the States, muuuuuucho expensive!\u201d And the top 15 at the pageant were offered scholarships. Did Aden think she\u2019d win? \u201cNo, God, no.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut top 15? I was like, \u2018I think I could do that\u2019.\u201d\nAden\u2019s mother was strongly against her entering the pageant, arguing it would distract from her studies, and that the two-piece burkini was too skimpy. Though they have since been able to find common ground through her advocacy and work with Unicef, it can feel like they are from two different cultures sometimes. She didn\u2019t tell her mum about the Sports Illustrated shoot \u201cuntil it hit newsstands\u201d.\nShe was also criticised by members of the Muslim community who saw modelling as haram \u2013 forbidden by Islamic law. \u201cIt was scary to put myself out there, because I didn\u2019t know if I would get backlash, or how bad it was going to be,\u201d she says. Two days before the pageant, Aden almost pulled out. But as she told the newspaper at the time: \u201cYou don\u2019t let being the first to do it stop you.\u201d\nShe ended up making the semi-finals, \u201cbraces and all. And then IMG came calling \u2013 like, \u2018Well, well, well\u2026 maybe I don\u2019t need school.\u2019\u201d She leans back, for a second jokily triumphant \u2013 then seems to feel a chill coming in from across the Atlantic. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Mom!\u201d\nThe global spotlight on Aden caught the eye of Carine Roitfeld, who flew her to New York to shoot the cover of CR Fashion Book with Gigi Hadid, Paris Jackson and legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti. Aden agonised about asking for a selfie with Gigi (\u201cSo cringy,\u201d she says now). As for Sorrenti, though, she had to Google her later.\nHis direction to her was, \u201cGive me sexy\u201d, she seems a little abashed to say. \u201cI didn\u2019t know fashion lingo, I didn\u2019t know photographers. I\u2019m a Minnesota girl \u2013 very small town.\u201d Even after signing with IMG, she watched all of Tyra Banks\u2019s outlandish reality series America\u2019s Next Top Model \u201cto practise\u201d. Seven months into her modelling career, she was still working part-time as a housekeeper in St Cloud.\nBut rather than asking Aden to change, fashion\u2019s royalty has made room for her as she is. Last week she was back in Kenya for a shoot and \u201cI was just thinking, how crazy is it that, in one lifetime, I\u2019ve gotten to experience both extremes.\u201d Aden says she does not feel angry about the inequality she has seen \u2013 partly because she does not find it to be productive. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I say: \u2018We don\u2019t want your pity.\u2019 Let\u2019s talk about solutions, invite refugees to the table. They\u2019re part of the conversation \u2013 no policies should be enacted without their say.\u201d\nThough she rules out a career in politics (\u201cfor now\u201d), in the future she hopes to return to Kakuma with Unicef to inspire hope within the camp for a new life beyond it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you what that would have meant to me as a six or seven-year-old \u2013 like, \u2018Wait, there\u2019s a life outside these walls?\u2019 Hopefully, it\u2019s not going to be so rare to see kids from the camps grow up and become teachers, lawmakers, presidents and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. There\u2019s talent everywhere.\u201d\nFor now Aden is pursuing opportunities in \u201cfashion activism\u201d. This month she was announced as the new face of the British accessories brand Bottletop, which was ahead of its time in positioning itself as \u201csustainable luxury\u201d in 2002. Its handbags and clutches, which are made from sustainable leather and upcycled metal ring pulls, help to alleviate poverty in Brazil, Nepal and Kenya. Aden is optimistic in general, but particularly about the potential for consumer choice to be a force for positive change: \u201cI think we\u2019re at a place where people want to support brands and organisations they know are giving back.\u201d She is also an ambassador for Bottletop\u2019s #Togetherband campaign, which is tasked with raising awareness of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. Aden is probably one of the few celebrities who can \u201crelate personally\u201d to all 17 of them. She has been assigned the eighth goal: \u201cDecent work and economic growth.\u201d The fact that the Swiss multinational bank UBS is a founding partner seems to suggest which way the wind is blowing.\n\u201cMy career in fashion is not just, \u2018I want to work with this brand, I want to get on that catwalk\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re not sitting here talking about \u2018Buy this heel, because this heel will make you feel sexy.\u2019\u201d She kicks up her stiletto boot, knee-high in black patent leather (admittedly very sexy). \u201cI\u2019m proud that I can say I combined fashion and activism. I can\u2019t do one without the other.\u201d\nAden sees that her story, from refugee camp to the cover of Vogue, is an unusual one. But she has had to navigate it herself \u2013 down to mentioning, at her very first meeting with IMG as a teenager in New York, that she would like to work with Unicef. \u201cI had to learn, in the beginning especially, that maybe I\u2019d never find another model who I could relate to. But I\u2019m making my own path, and it works perfectly for me.\u201d\nFashion editor Jo Jones; photographer\u2019s assistant Dan Ross; fashion assistant Lena Young; makeup by Dina at Frank Agency using Dior Forever and Dior Capture Totale C.E.L.L.

Our economy is only around 1.5% of the world\u2019s total GDP and yet we have no qualms in going to the G20 every year and pushing our agenda.\nBut on climate change? Sorry, we are impotent.\nExcept we\u2019re not.\nWe are the 15th biggest emitter in the world, the biggest on a per capita basis among advanced economies. We have massive power, because we are wealthy enough to show what can be done. If we do nothing, it becomes a strong reason for anyone who emits less than us either in total or per capita to do the same.\nAnd the problem is we are using what power we have to obstruct action on climate change.\nMorrison argued that \u201cif anything, Australia is an overachiever on our commitments, on global commitments, and for 2030, we will meet those as well with the mechanisms that we\u2019ve put in place and we\u2019ll ensure we do achieve that\u201d.\nWhat utter tosh.\nOur Kyoto commitment is based on the dodgy counting of land use; and our commitment to Paris targets doubles down on that dodginess by using carry-over credits from the Kyoto target \u2013 something nations such as the UK are now fighting hard to have removed.\nOur target is also well below what scientists say is needed to keep temperature rises below 1.5C.\nThirteen months ago the UN issued a report that concluded we have 12 years to do something to limit climate change, after which it will be too late to keep the rise in temperatures below 1.5C.\nThe science has not changed in that time; all that has is we now have only 11 years.\nBut this week it was reported that fossil fuel production by 2030 is set to be double that which is needed to keep temperature rises below 1.5C.\nWe are failing, and Australia\u2019s own policy is ensuring that failure will continue.\nBut heck, pointing that out will seem biased, and so the centrist looks for a chance to appear balanced.\nIt is why they have grabbed onto the disruption of Extinction Rebellion and loud claims by the Greens \u2013 because the centrist loves nothing more than being able to tell both sides to calm down.\nA clear example of this came this week from former ALP cabinet minister Craig Emerson, who wrote an opinion piece in the AFR denouncing tribalism that he argues is killing civil discourse.\nIn it he suggested that \u201cnational socialism is resurgent. But so is international green socialism \u2013 a variant of white supremacism\u201d.\nYes, nothing like suggesting sections of the environmental movement are racists to get that civil discourse going.\nEmerson suggested this white supremacism occurred when \u201cwell-off greens demand the races of Asia and Africa forgo economic development using fossil fuels to rectify the sins we white, affluent humans have inflicted on the planet\u201d.\nYes \u201cthe races\u201d of Asia and Africa.\nEmerson didn\u2019t help his case against tribalism by spending most of the week on Twitter berating Greens supporters and suggesting the ALP was the only major party doing anything good on climate change (if the ALP isn\u2019t the biggest force of tribalism in Australian politics, I clearly need to invest in a new dictionary).\nHe further weakened his cause by suggesting that people were arguing that poorer nations needed to shift immediately to 100% renewable energy.\nNo organisation or person of any note is arguing this (although Emerson did find a random person on Twitter).\nBut worse, this argument that fossil fuels help poorer nations is a retread of the old argument that \u201ccoal is good for humanity\u201d that Tony Abbott was pushing in 2014, and which was easily debunked at the time.\nIt was the same argument that saw coal mining companies argue to leaders of the G20 that coal was needed because the WHO had reported that 4 million people die prematurely from household air pollution because \u201cnearly 3 billion people use primitive stoves to burn wood or biomass to cook and heat homes\u201d.\nExcept what the WHO actually noted was that \u201caround 3 billion people cook using polluting open fires or simple stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass and coal\u201d.\nAnd yet Emerson\u2019s article, which pushed specious arguments about demands for immediate change to renewables, which likened sections of the environmentalist movement to white supremacists, and which echoed lines from mining companies was met with gushing praise from some very senior journalists.\nThat\u2019s because the column called for calm and reason, and centrists love calm and reason and love even more to praise anyone calling for it.\nAnd so in the space of five years we went from an argument pushed by Tony Abbott and mining companies to encourage more coal mines being shown to be clearly fallacious to it now being praised as part of a reasonable approach.\nThis is because centrists care more about being seen to be neutral than whether that neutrality is worthy, or worrying if the centre has moved.\nIt is the force that has journalists and politicians arguing that we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good, and yet spending little time examining how good something has to be before the perfect becomes its enemy.\nNot all extremism is equal and no force of social or economic change happened due to people refusing to make waves. It happened because people were prepared to go to prison, be attacked, and seek to disrupt those who would go about their lives ignoring the issue.\nCentrists love the final vote that sees change occur \u2013 where politicians from both sides sit together and agree; they care only in retrospect for the work, suffering and effort over decades that leads to that change.\nAnd they ignore that throughout those decades, the powerful in the media and politics actively prevented change occurring by spending more time calling for calm and reason than noting reality.\nAnd so long as powerful journalists believe that arguments are worthy purely because they call for a middle ground, then ever will they be a force that prevents effective action on climate change.\nGreg Jericho is a columnist for Guardian Australia", "label": 0}, "text-769": {"text": "Barnaby Joyce says Coalition risks 'political annihilation' in the bush over drought\nBarnaby Joyce says the Coalition risks \u201cpolitical annihilation\u201d in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams, as Labor lashes the government for failing to produce a national drought strategy.\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, toured drought-affected Stanthorpe in Queensland on Wednesday, saying parts of the state were clearly suffering \u201cnatural disaster\u201d and criticising the government for failing to build a single dam since being elected in 2013.\n\u201cThey talked about dams more than a thousand times in the parliament, this government has spoken about dams [but] they haven\u2019t dug a hole yet anywhere in the entire country to build a dam,\u201d Albanese said.\nFollowing controversy over Joyce\u2019s role as special drought envoy, which Labor has criticised as a political appointment that has not delivered value for taxpayers, the former Nationals leader told Guardian Australia he agreed with Labor that the government needed to \u201cget cracking\u201d on dam construction.\nWhile the government is refusing to release the \u201cawful lot\u201d of reports Joyce claims he sent Morrison while in the role, Joyce said he had used his position to lobby for dam funding, telling Morrison that dams were desperately needed to help provide drought-stricken communities with economic stimulus.\nHe warned that if Tamworth ran out of water, the government would be faced with a \u201ccrisis\u201d that could see voters punish the Coalition at the ballot box.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good talking about the crisis when it arrives, it should have been dealt with years ago, but it must be dealt with now, and it will be political annihilation if we don\u2019t,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cI would say, oh, be careful \u2013 the electorate is febrile.\u201d\nHe pointed to the New South Wales state election result that saw the Shooters and Fishers party win the seats of Barwon and Murray off the Nationals and secure a stronghold in the seat of Orange as a warning for what could face the Coalition if it did not act.\n\u201cAnd the thing that will placate people\u2019s fears is if they see that we are actually doing something, they will say, well they can\u2019t make it rain, but they are having a crack at it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop talking about dams, and start building them.\u201d\nJoyce said that he had reported to Morrison while envoy that he believed six new dams were needed to help drought affected communities, listing the Nathan dam at the top of the Dawson river, O\u2019Connor dam near Mackay, Mole river near Tenterfield, Dungowan dam near Tamworth, Dubbo and Walcha as proposed sites.\nHe also said he hoped Labor\u2019s support for dam construction could pressure state governments into removing and streamlining regulations to make them happen.\n\u201cRather than be parochial, let\u2019s work together \u2013 nobody is going to lose any political skin over this if people see us working together.\u201d\nThe water resources minister, David Littleproud, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, were also on a drought tour on Wednesday, visiting Inverell in northern NSW to hear directly from farmers.\nWhen asked about water infrastructure, Littleproud said the states had control over water resources, and called on them to act.", "label": 0}, "text-770": {"text": "Changes to Darwin\u2019s Climate History are Not Logical\nTHE hubris of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology is on full display with its most recent remodelling of the historic temperature record for Darwin.  The Bureau has further dramatically increased the rate of global warming at Darwin by further artificially lowering historic temperatures.\nThis begins by shortening the historical temperature record so that it begins just after the very hot years of the Federation drought. Then by changing the daily values: that is changing the observed measured temperatures to something else.\nFor example, on 1st January 1910 the maximum temperature recorded at the Darwin post office was 34.2 degrees Celsius.\nA few years ago, the Bureau changed this to 33.8 degrees Celsius, cooling the recorded temperature by 0.4 degrees.  In its most recent re-revision of Darwin\u2019s climate history the temperature on this day has been further reduced, and is now just 32.8.\nEnvironmental reporter for the Australian newspaper, Graham Lloyd, asked the Bureau why it had made such changes earlier in the week.  A spokesperson is quoted in The Weekend Australian as follows:\n\u201cFor the case of Darwin, a downward adjustment to older records is applied to account for differences between the older sites and the current site, and difference\u00acs between older thermometers and the current automated sensor.\n\u201cIn other words, the adjustments estimate what historical temperatures would look like if they were recorded with today\u2019s equipment at the current site.\u201d\nYet this is a version of exactly the same reason given by the Bureau just six years ago for reducing the temperature on 1 January 1910 by \u2018only\u2019 0.4 degrees.\nNeither the equipment, nor the site has changed since ACORN-SAT Version 1 was published in 2012.\nYet another 1 degree has been shaven from the historical temperature record!\nTo be clear, the weather station has been at the airport since February 1941, and an automatic weather station was installed on 1 October 1990. A Stevenson screen was first installed at the post office site in 1894, and has always been used at the airport site.\nSo, why was the temperature dropped down by a further one degree for 1 January 1910 in the most recent revision \u2013 undertaken just a few months ago?  There is no logical or reasonable explanation.\nApparently, at the Bureau, the future is certain and the past can be continually changed \u2013 history can be continually revised.\nWhen the daily values are added-up, and compared between versions as annual mean maximum temperatures we see the magnitude of the change \u2013 and its effect on temperature trends.\nThe warming trend of 1.3 degrees C per 100 years in ACORN V1 has been changed to 1.8 degrees C per 100 years in Version 2. The annual average maximum temperature for 1942, as one example, has been reduced by 0.5 degrees.\nIn the maximum temperature record as actually measured at Darwin from 1895 to the present \u2014 and taking into consideration the move from the airport to the post office \u2013- there is no warming trend in the Darwin temperature record.  This is consistent with other locations in northern Australia with long high-quality records, for example Richmond in north western Queensland.\nWhat the Bureau has done to the historical temperature record for Darwin is indefensible. The Bureau has artificially shortened and cooled Darwin\u2019s climate history to make it consistent with the theory of human-caused global warming.", "label": 1}, "text-771": {"text": "European parliament split on declaring climate emergency\nThe European parliament is split over whether to declare a global climate emergency before next week\u2019s crucial UN summit.\nIf passed, the climate emergency resolution \u2013 to be voted on on Thursday \u2013 would throw down the gauntlet to incoming European Union leaders. The European commission\u2019s president-elect, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to take office on 1 December, having promised \u201ca European green deal\u201d in her first 100 days.\nThe draft resolution states there is \u201can environment and climate emergency in Europe and globally\u201d and declares the EU will \u201ctake action accordingly\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a message to European citizens, to young people, to say that Europe is the very first continent to declare a climate emergency and to act accordingly,\u201d said Pascal Canfin, a French MEP who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment committee and co-authored the resolution.\nThe text also references the US president Donald Trump\u2019s decision to begin formal withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement earlier this month.\n\u201cWe need to send a signal that after Trump\u2019s decision, Europe is more than ever committed to deliver,\u201d said Canfin, an ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron.\nWhile the climate emergency resolution is supported by many Liberals, Socialists, Greens and the radical left, the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) \u2013 the European parliament\u2019s largest group \u2013 is uneasy about the word \u201cemergency\u201d. A source said the German word der Notstand was associated with the name of an infamous law of the Nazi era.\nThe EPP has tabled an amendment stating that the parliament \u201cdeclares a climate and environmental urgency\u201d [sic] and calling on the EU to take \u201curgent action\u201d.\n\u201cI fully underline that we see the urgency of the issue. We need to prioritise this,\u201d said the EPP leader, Manfred Weber, when asked whether his group would back the climate emergency text.\nThe parliament\u2019s political forces are also divided over how quickly Europe should cut emissions to reach a target of net zero emissions by 2050.\nIn a separate vote on Thursday, the European parliament is expected to approve a resolution stating that current EU climate targets are \u201cnot in line\u201d with the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which calls for keeping global heating \u201cwell below\u201d 2C above pre-industrial levels while aiming for only a 1.5C rise.\nThe EPP supports an emissions reduction of \u201cat least 50%\u201d by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels), while Liberals and Socialists would go to 55%. The Greens argue that anything less than 65% is inadequate.\n\u201cWe have to realise that to meet the Paris agreement there are \u2026 very, very strict limits of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that we can release into the atmosphere from now for the next hundreds of years. And if we choose to release that much during this next decade then we can\u2019t keep the temperature below 2C,\u201d said the Swedish Green MEP P\u00e4r Holmgren.\nHolmgren, a meteorologist and well-known TV weatherman until elected to the European parliament this year, advised the Thunberg family on climate science long before Greta began her school strike.\nHolmgren told the Guardian that he was frustrated with political leaders using Greta\u2019s name, but not taking sufficient action: \u201cThere are so many quoting Greta, or saying we have to listen to Greta, or saying we have to keep global warming below 1.5C \u2026 and to hear someone say that, and then still not deliver?\n\u201cYes, there is a climate emergency and it has been for many decades, but if you want to say that then you have to do something about it as well.\u201d\nOthers say a 55% emissions reduction goal for 2030 is in line with scientific advice. \u201cWe are politicians, so we need to bring society on board. We are not drafting an IPCC report,\u201d Canfin said. \u201cWe are drafting something that will apply to business, SMEs, agriculture, farmers and citizens.\u201d\nThe Greens\u2019 preferred goal of at least 65% is based on a recommendation by the Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, a coalition of 1,700 NGOs that bases its analysis on an an IPCC report on how to keep global heating below 1.5C.\nThat report shows other pathways to cut emissions, but some increase the risk of overshooting the 1.5C ceiling on temperature rises, which scientists say is essential to avoid the most dangerous consequences.\nThe scale of the task was outlined by the UN environmental agency on Tuesday, when it reported that global emissions must fall by more than 7% each year from now until 2030 to stay within the 1.5C limit.\nMost EU member states have signed up to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, although Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary continue to hold out, as they await promised EU funds to help their economies go green.\nThe EU has focused its attention on the more distant 2050 target, fearful of damaging splits over the imminent 2030 deadline. \u201cWe have been campaigning on the increase of the 2030 target for years and it was disgracefully ignored,\u201d said Klaus R\u00f6hrig, EU climate and energy policy coordinator at CAN Europe.\nThe EU\u2019s current objective is to cut emissions by 40% by 2030, which was \u201cshockingly insufficient\u201d R\u00f6hrig said.", "label": 0}, "text-772": {"text": "The two meetings that changed the trajectory of Australia's coronavirus response\nWe\u2019ve forgotten this now, because this pandemic has unmoored us. New information about the crisis crests by the minute.\nBut back in January, the single biggest health and economic calamity of our lifetimes crept towards us slowly. In Australia, we thought 2020 had delivered its worst when the swathes of the coast and country burned, and cities choked in smoke. As we crept towards the Australia Day holiday, we thought we were about to turn the corner.\nWe were wrong.\nBy the third week of January, the disaster of Covid-19 was escalating at its point of origin. By 21 January, 198 cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the Wuhan region, with three fatalities. Another 19 cases were reported in other regions of China, and a smattering of infections had turned up in Thailand, Japan and South Korea.\nThe distant thunder in Wuhan triggered Australia\u2019s bureaucratic machinery for managing a pandemic. The Communicable Disease Network requested a coordinated national health response on 20 January, and Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, convened a meeting of his state counterparts to discuss developments.\nThe national incident room was activated and Murphy\u2019s group, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, endorsed enhanced border measures for the three direct flights a week between Wuhan and Sydney \u2013 but not mass screening at airports. The next day, 21 January, Murphy told journalists this was now a \u201crapidly evolving situation\u201d. Concern had been heightened by events of the \u201clast three or four days\u201d. There was now evidence of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19.\nAt around the same time that Murphy was briefing reporters, the national women\u2019s soccer team of China passed through Wuhan on the way to Australia. A week later, that team was holed up in quarantine in Brisbane. There was a confirmed case in the state, a Wuhan resident, in isolation at the Gold Coast University Hospital: Queensland\u2019s patient zero. By the end of January, Australia hit seven cases.\nQueensland was the first state to move. It declared a public health emergency on 29 January. In Canberra, the response was also gathering pace. Morrison told reporters the government would activate Christmas Island as a quarantine area. He also upgraded the travel advice, telling Australians to reconsider all travel to China.\nBut coronavirus was not the prime minister\u2019s only problem. Over those same late summer days, he was easing Bridget McKenzie out of her portfolio after a scathing audit report about the management of sports grants. Easing McKenzie out triggered a toddler tantrum in the Nationals. Barnaby Joyce made a bull run at Michael McCormack. Obscured by the B-grade theatrics, and by the pursuit new facts about sports grants, the looming health crisis continued to build in the background as the Australian parliament roiled throughout February.\nOn the last sitting day of the month, 27 February, Morrison summoned reporters to his courtyard at parliament house and dialled it up to 11. He declared the risk of a global pandemic \u201cis very much upon us\u201d.\nHe initiated the government\u2019s coronavirus emergency response plan. There were now substantial outbreaks in South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. There were cases in Africa, West Asia, Europe and South America. But Morrison was both moving, and soothing. Normal life would go on. \u201cYou can still go to the football, you can still go to the cricket, you can still go and play with your friends down the street, you can go off to the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal.\u201d\nA day later, health ministers met in Melbourne. The dominant issue was aged care. A senior official familiar with the discussion on that day insists that only Queensland, which had already declared a health emergency, and New South Wales, had a sharp grasp of what was coming. Victoria was slow, but would come in forcefully later. \u201cThere really was no national leadership at that point,\u201d the official says.\nMorrison and the government would doubtless contest this assessment by pointing to the steady accumulation of action since 20 January. The government was also beginning to talk itself around on the likely need for fiscal stimulus. The first package of measures was in its infancy.\nBut the clear impression from the states in late February, at least at the health intersection point, was Canberra hadn\u2019t yet locked on just how bad the Covid-19 health crisis would ultimately get.\nIn March, the operating tempo would change.\nTwo key events would drag the federation of Australia into the new normal.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary event. Live coverage throbs day and night. Billions blur into other billions, days become indistinguishable. But in Australia, two incidents in March moved the dial, pushing the management of the crisis into new territory.\nThe first escalation happened on 13 March, when Morrison met the premiers and chief ministers in Sydney for the council of Australian governments. The second major pivot point played out over the following week, culminating in the weekend of 21 and 22 March.\nThe Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, gave an inkling of what was to come on 10 March. Standing inside the Royal Melbourne hospital, he warned journalists \u201cextreme measures\u201d were coming. Schools would be closed, entire workforces would be working from home, sporting events would be cancelled. \u201cThat time will come,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe are going to ask a lot of Victorians.\u201d\nTwo days later, in Canberra, Morrison launched the first fiscal stimulus package, which was predicated on businesses being open, at least in some form, and consumers being able to spend. He told reporters he was confident the targeted measures would be enough to \u201cdo the job\u201d of propping up the economy. If more was needed, there was always the budget in May.\nBy the evening of 12 March, the premiers and chief ministers were at Kirribilli House with Morrison for a social gathering ahead of Coag the next day. Some of the leaders noticed when Andrews hung back when others left. The Victorian premier congratulated the prime minister on the stimulus, but predicted government assistance would shortly need to tick over into survival payments. Swathes of the economy were going to have to shut down.\nMorrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye\nBy the time the leaders woke the next day and made their way out to Parramatta stadium, which was the venue for the Coag talks, the world had reached 130,000 Covid-19 cases, and more than 4,700 deaths had been recorded. The Italian health system had been overwhelmed. There were more than 1,000 fatalities.\nOvernight, there was a wipeout on global financial markets. London and Wall Street had recorded their worst trading days since Black Monday in 1987. Donald Trump slapped a travel ban on Europe. When the Australian markets opened, the ASX plunged 7%. The Reserve Bank pumped more than $8bn into short term bank funding. Flight Centre closed 100 stores. The Grand Prix fell over, which triggered a cascade of event cancellations over the course of the day.\nThat Friday felt like pure mayhem. Live coverage could barely keep pace with events. But inside the cavernous football stadium, the Coag meeting started with the preordained agenda. There were briefings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and from Treasury. Murphy, the chief medical officer, also supplied a detailed briefing. The leaders then broke for a cup of tea.\nRunning parallel with the leaders, health advisers from the states were also conferring by teleconference. Murphy was shuttling between the leaders meeting and the teleconference. Victoria, which had recorded the first case of community transmission that Friday, and Queensland, pushed during the discussion for stronger and more urgent action to force social distancing. People familiar with the dynamic in the meeting of medical officers insist it wasn\u2019t a boil over, but the forward-leaning states insisted more was needed. They sought a consensus to craft new, stronger, recommendations to be put to the leaders.\nMurphy conveyed that shift to the leaders meeting. That news hit the group like a thunderclap. Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Officials were promptly turfed out of the room and the leaders were left in a huddle, in a cavernous, empty football stadium in western Sydney, to determine what to do next.\nThe table had been set for lunch. Lunch didn\u2019t happen. Tumult happened. But within the hour, entirely on the hop, nine political leaders had invented a new governance structure. No papers, no proposals, no guidance from officials. Morrison suggested they manage the crisis by convening regularly as a national cabinet. The proposal materialised in the room. The states agreed and insisted the group just be them, first ministers \u2013 no opposition leaders.\nThe group created an emergency national government of nine. Morrison later bolted in the national cabinet as a subcommittee of the regular cabinet.\nThe leaders then moved to the discussion about imposing new limits on crowds, and how that would be announced to the public. There was a debate about when the proposed restriction should commence. Now, or Monday? Did people need to be given notice given it was now mid-afternoon on a Friday and events were scheduled for the weekend? There was a view some notice was required.\nMorrison war gamed in the leaders huddle about whether going to the opening game of the NRL season on Saturday night \u2013 something the prime minister had been foregrounding for days \u2013 would be a good or a bad signal. Would people be unsettled if he suddenly wasn\u2019t going? The leaders resolved the position they would telegraph, and emerged, and Morrison announced there would be a ban on non-essential gatherings of 500, effective Monday. The prime minister said he\u2019d be going to the football on Saturday night because there was no cause for alarm, and \u201cit might be the last game I get to go to for a very long time\u201d.\nThe day wasn\u2019t yet over. Shortly after the leaders scattered, there was another bombshell. The home affairs minister Peter Dutton had been infected with the virus, likely during a trip to America. That news broke in the early evening, raising alarm about whether the prime minister and other key cabinet ministers had been exposed to the illness, and may need to self-isolate.\nA small frenzy ensued, particularly when photographs emerged of Dutton grinning next to Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump. The story bounced quickly into American news outlets.\nBy 7.30pm on Friday night, Morrison was not going to watch his beloved Sharks.\nThe rapid recalibration at Coag was the first of two gear changes. The next one played out over the following weekend.\nCovid-19 is a health crisis that has triggered the most profound economic shock since the global financial crisis. Morrison has told colleagues the impact of this pandemic will be more far-reaching than the Depression. As the world wobbles, Australia is worried about failed states, and the risk of a global sovereign debt crisis.\nThe national government is responsible for economic wellbeing. This crisis has triggered a legitimate dialogue between the tiers of government about protecting lives and livelihoods; how to craft public health measures that save lives without deepening an economic crisis that would threaten wellbeing in other ways. Morrison wanted to craft measures that would enable Australia\u2019s economy to move into a period of hibernation, and he wanted to sequence the inevitable health restrictions to flatten the curve of infections with bursts of significant fiscal firepower.\nThe economic response to this crisis is massive, as it was a decade ago during the global financial crisis. The Morrison government is drawing on the central bank, on the Council of Financial Regulators, on the retail banks, on big corporates, on coordination commissions. Public servants are being redeployed to frontline agencies. Sacked call centre workers are being picked up by Centrelink, and working in contact-tracing call centres in the states. Morrison and Frydenberg are talking regularly to their counterparts overseas.\nWhile the economy is largely Canberra\u2019s problem, the states manage health systems, and there was concern in the two most populous states that tough restrictions necessary to stop infections were not moving fast enough. Which brings us to the events of the weekend of 21 and 22 March.\nThe Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections\nIt was this weekend where the inevitable tension in the federation between saving jobs and preventing unmanageable numbers of ICU patients reached its peak, and manifested publicly as sonic boom Sunday.\nThe NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, had endured a terrible few days. Passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship had been allowed to disembark and disperse around the country even though some were already ill with Covid-19.\nThat was a total fiasco, and it triggered inevitable blame-shifting and finger-pointing between NSW Health and Border Force in Canberra. The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections over the coming week.\nSydneysiders also flocked en masse on Saturday to Bondi beach, taking advantage of the glorious early autumn weather. Social distancing was nowhere in evidence, and by Sunday, the number of Covid-19 cases in Australia sprinted past 1,000. A tipping point had been reached.\nIn Canberra, Morrison was hunkered down with colleagues finalising the government\u2019s second stimulus package. The plan was to unveil the $66bn worth of new measures on Sunday. Journalists were briefed late on Saturday so stories could appear in the Sunday papers and on the political shows.\nBut in Sydney and Melbourne, Berejiklian and Andrews were alarmed. They felt public health restrictions needed to be imposed more quickly, because people were ignoring polite entreaties from politicians and chief medical officers. Canberra was not blocking action, but a dialogue about how hard to go with social distancing restrictions that would force businesses to close remained unresolved.\nBerejiklian and Andrews were in touch throughout Saturday, into Saturday night and then again Sunday morning. Berejiklian told Morrison on Saturday night that NSW and Victoria wanted to implement the first stage of restrictions pronto \u2013 the closure of places like pubs and clubs. She said the two states were prepared to move ahead of other jurisdictions if there wasn\u2019t prompt consensus through the national cabinet.\nNot all states were persuaded that it was time to force widespread lockdowns, and worried they would be dragged along in the slipstream when there wasn\u2019t a solid evidence base. Politically it would be hard for premiers to explain to their constituents why some states were moving and they were not. One official from another state says: \u201cWe [were] moving ahead of the health advice, and all the political pressure is to go further; to be out in front of this\u201d.\nThe story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet\nBut the ACT was fully on board with the NSW/Victoria view that stage one lockdowns had to happen, and now. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, noted there could not be one rule for Canberra and another for Queanbeyan. A leaders meeting scheduled originally for Tuesday had been brought forward to Sunday evening.\nThe two premiers were not mucking around. Morrison was in his courtyard in Canberra about two-thirds of the way through unveiling stimulus round two when a reporter from the Nine Network asked the prime minister to comment on a new push by NSW and Victoria \u201cfor a total shutdown on non-essential businesses\u201d. The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet, and the news channels were broadcasting live.\nMorrison was not pleased by the political firebomb, but he ploughed on. He responded by saying he would be guided by the health advice that was currently being prepared by the chief medical officers. If he had a view, he would be expressing it in the national cabinet, not on the hop to journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s the orderly and calm way to deal with these things, and to make decisions in a responsible manner.\u201d\nPublic statements from the two states followed confirming that was in fact the position: restrictions needed to happen, and they were prepared to go in advance of others. Victoria upped the ante by signalling it would close schools from Tuesday. The national cabinet had been jolted into more urgency on the health side. The view in the states intent on pushing the envelope was this was a necessary jolt, delivered just in the nick of time.\nLater that night, after the national cabinet discussion, Morrison fronted the cameras and confirmed pubs and clubs would close. Restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only. Schools, confusingly, seemed to be both open and closed.\nGiven the obvious tumult of the day, Morrison also felt compelled to affirm the national cabinet had not splintered. The self-created government of nine had mauled, inelegantly, to a point of consensus. It has weathered its first big test. \u201cAll of its members are very committed to its processes and decisions,\u201d the prime minister said.\nThis pandemic is close. It casts a shadow. \u201cWe are all next to it,\u201d Josh Frydenberg tells Guardian Australia while downing a late dinner in his Canberra digs one night this week. As the treasurer was working up the third economic support package in as many weeks \u2013 the $130bn for wages subsidies the government unfurled early this week \u2013 his cousin was seriously ill in intensive care in a Melbourne hospital. Frydenberg\u2019s cousin had picked up the virus during a trip to London with his wife, and soon succumbed to a high temperature and breathing difficulties. Fortunately, he is now recovering well.\nAfter the watershed weekend in March, the public health restrictions have only gathered pace. Stage one was followed quickly by stages two and three. One of the recent national cabinets decreed that gatherings would go from 10 to two. Some insiders say the health advice going into the meeting was to maintain the restriction at 10, but leaders defaulted to two. Queensland pushed for one of the more recent measures \u2013 quarantining returning travellers in hotels. The state argued that particular measure would have the biggest positive impact on infection rates without inflicting more pain on the general community.\nMessaging at the beginning was confusing, and at times contradictory. But the public health messaging has become simpler, and more forceful. Stay home, unless there is a very good reason to go out. The commonwealth meanwhile keeps rolling out economic support. Wages subsidies. Free childcare, at least for some. Support for tenants and landlords.\nThe new normal is uncomfortable. It is disconcerting. Gathering places that once teemed with life are empty. States are walled off. The businesses still open wonder when they will have to close their doors. The federal parliament is only sitting in short sessions to pass specific measures. Liberty has been curtailed by emergency powers now in place across all the states and territories, enforced by state police. It is reasonable to wonder how long the public will consent to these arrangements. Australia is a vibrant, noisy, democracy, not a police state.\nThings feel grim, because they are grim. The suspension of ordinary existence is absolutely necessary in the service of saving lives, but we have entered a new normal that could persist not for six months, which is the timeframe invoked most regularly by political leaders, but for a year. Or two.\nGovernments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially\nThe medical profession remains on the fence about whether the governments of Australia are currently getting the balance right. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, tells Guardian Australia that can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe truth of the matter is governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially,\u201d Bartone says.\n\u201cWe can raise all number of reasons about why that\u2019s the case including mixed messaging, poor information and communication, and indifference by younger sections of the community who thought it was an old person\u2019s disease and they didn\u2019t have to worry. For all those reasons, governments have had to take the community on a conversation.\u201d\nBartone also cautions against some of the optimistic commentary that has emerged over the course of the past week that Australia has begun to flatten the curve of new infections. \u201cWe are flattening it but remember that also, we had a big spike in numbers last week and previously because half the Australian population abroad returned home before the lockdowns.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d expect a bump,\u201d Bartone says. \u201cYou worry whether that flattening is actually a true flattening or whether we came off a high base, but there is still an underlying trend that needs to be flattened.\u201d\nAndrews brushes off commentary that Morrison was too slow to act on the health impacts. \u201cI think the PM is doing a fantastic job in very very difficult circumstances. I sent him a text the other night to say no prime minister in our lifetime has had to face down something as significant as this, and that national cabinet is working extremely well, and this was a fantastic suggestion from him and we are all very grateful to be acting as one government almost, if you like, across the country rather than nine of us doing our own thing.\u201d\nHe says the federation creates a tension reflecting divided responsibilities. \u201cThere is that tension, that\u2019s perfectly healthy and appropriate. It\u2019s a big thing to close businesses and see people stood down. These are massive decisions to make and there is a very big toll that comes with that including anxiety and all sorts of other issues, often tragic issues, like increased family violence rates for instance and all sorts of other mental health considerations. It\u2019s not a bad thing that we are all grappling with that very difficult choice, trying to smash the virus and trying to preserve the economy as much as we can.\u201d\nBarr says the ad hoc government of nine is learning on its feet. \u201cWe are getting there now but we weren\u2019t quite there initially around fully appreciating how much the health curve would impact on the economic outcome. I think that gap is now being closed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a few things that in hindsight you would like to have got there a week to 10 days earlier, but we have got there, sometimes just in time. What I would like to see in the next phase of this is we are not playing catch-up so much; that we are shaping the future a bit more rather than reacting to the past.\u201d\nBarr insists the national cabinet has brought out the best in the federation, and could, in fact, be a segue to a newer, more effective style of politics and governance. \u201cThis mechanism has forced cooperation that we haven\u2019t seen before. The level of information sharing is much improved from the case before.\n\u201cIf you were observing that national cabinet from outside and you knew nothing about Australian politics you wouldn\u2019t know which side of the fence people were on. If you\u2019d said to me three weeks ago Newstart would be doubled, we\u2019d have a significant wage subsidy scheme that is effectively a guaranteed minimum income, that private health would be enlisted in the public system in this way, that there would be talk of nationalising certain industries, people would have thought you were crazy, but this is a once-in-a-century health and economic crisis that required consensus decision-making and more centrist policy outcomes.\u201d\nWe are asking so much of so many \u2026 it is so frustrating not to be able to give people an end point\nMorrison warned Australians this week we are in this for the long haul. \u201cIt will be months. We need to make changes that we can live with and that we can implement day after day, week after week, month after month.\u201d\nAndrews is even blunter about the prognosis.\nThere is no obvious end point to this crisis, at least not until there is a vaccine. \u201cThe most frustrating thing about this is not being able to give people an end date. We are asking so much of so many, taking extraordinary steps, it is so frustrating not to be able to give people an end point.\u201d\nNobody, he says, is going to the football or for an overseas break for the foreseeable future. \u201cThings like international travel and restrictions on larger gatherings are going to be with us for a long time and that vaccine is some way off. \n\u201cAre we going to have many international students at universities across Melbourne and Victoria next year? Don\u2019t think so.

The figures are edging closer to those of the 2017 outbreak, when 1 million cases were reported.\nThe prospect of a major new cholera epidemic, exacerbated by both the advent of rains and the difficulties for humanitarian workers in reaching conflict affected areas, comes with no end to the violence in sight.\nThe warnings coincide with the decision by President Donald Trump on Tuesday to veto a resolution passed by Congress to end US military assistance in Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen \u2013 seen as a significant political message.\n\u201cThis resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,\u201d Trump wrote in explaining his veto.\nThe US provides billions of dollars of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen with members of Congress expressing concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014.\nThe fighting in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country has also left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the brink of famine.\nDavid Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid group, said: \u201cThis veto by President Trump is morally wrong and strategically wrongheaded.

Moves to rapidly ramp up action would be another key goal, with current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming.\nThe negotiations will take place against a background of ominous news: the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions were rising again, when they need to fall by half by 2030. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.\nThe political backdrop contains challenges as well, with climate change denial from the US president, Donald Trump, and attacks on the UN process from Brazil\u2019s incoming Bolsonaro administration. The hosting of the summit by a coal-friendly Polish government further worries some observers. But the EU\u2019s new intention to become climate neutral and the plummeting cost of renewable energy have been positives, while a year of extreme weather was anticipated to focus minds.\n\u201cWe are clearly the last generation that can change the course of climate change, but we are also the first generation with its consequences,\u201d said Kristalina Georgieva, the CEO of the World Bank. The bank announced on Monday that its record $100bn (\u00a378bn) of climate funding from 2021-2025 would for the first time be split equally between projects to cut emissions and those protecting people from the floods, storms and droughts that global warming is making worse.\nIn recent years, just 5% of global funding has gone on protection, but 2018 has seen climate impacts hit hard, with heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and California and huge floods in India, Japan and east Africa. \u201cWe are already seeing the devastating impact of climate change,\u201d Georgieva told the Guardian. \u201cWe strongly believe that action ought to go both on mitigation and on adaptation.\u201d\n\u201cClimate extremes are the new normal,\u201d said Prof Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, in the Netherlands. \u201cThe climate debate can no longer only be about the causes \u2013 it also needs to focus on how billions of people at risk can rapidly adapt.\nRich nations have promised $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and develop clean energy. Negotiators in Poland would have to bring the two blocs together with firm agreement on how the promise would be fulfilled.\nGebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries Group, said: \u201cWe represent almost one billion people, the people who are least responsible for climate change but among those most vulnerable to its effects. The longer poor countries have to wait [for funding], the larger the cost will become.\u201d\nThe negotiators in Poland must also produce a rulebook governing how action pledged under the Paris agreement was tracked and reported to ensure all nations play their part.\n\u201cFair and effective rules for accounting must be established, with special responsibilities for the big emitters such as the US and Europe but also China and India,\u201d said Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \u201cWhile defining a rulebook sounds boring, it is in fact essential.\u201d\nThe role of the Polish hosts will be crucial and the deputy energy minister Micha\u0142 Kurtyka has said it would focus on using forests to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, electric vehicles and ensuring workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new jobs.\nPoland generates 80% of its electricity from coal and the UN summit will take place in a coal mining town, Katowice. The Polish government has also allowed two coal companies to sponsor the summit.\n\u201cHaving major coal companies as climate summit sponsors sends the worst possible signal at the worst possible time,\u201d said Robert Cyglicki, Greenpeace\u2019s director in Central and Eastern Europe. \u201cIt would be like Philip Morris sponsoring a health summit where a cigarette ban is supposed to be agreed. We will know this was a successful summit if coal companies regret sponsoring it.\u201d\nMany nations remain firmly committed to climate action, particularly France and China. But the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned last week that the rise of populism was undermining the political will of some countries to work with others. \u201cWe have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has led in my opinion to a lack of political will.\u201d\n\u201cEvery day, we witness the effects of the changing climate on poor and vulnerable people around the world,\u201d said Adriana Opromolla, at NGO Caritas Internationalis. \u201cTransformation is possible, but political will is needed to make it happen.\u201d", "label": 0}, "text-775": {"text": "Disentangling the Renewable Energy Scam\nThe real subsidy is rooted in renewable portfolio requirements in about 30 states. These states require that a certain percentage of electricity come from renewable sources. The quota ramps over time. For example it might ramp from 20% now to 50% by 2030.  These quotas create a chain of events that guarantee solar and wind energy a market for years to come with a guaranteed profit. If that is not enough, the industry is trying to freeze the quotas into state constitutions so as to make it difficult for the electricity consumers to get out of the trap that has been set for them.\nRenewable energy has been defined in an illogical way so as to favor solar and wind.  The ostensible motive for increasing renewable energy is to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and thus avoid a supposed global warming catastrophe.  But hydro and nuclear are prohibited from being used to meet the renewable energy quota, even though they don\u2019t emit CO2.\nElectricity is responsible for 28% of U.S. CO2 emissions.  The rest is from transportation, heating, and industrial processes.  Yet the emphasis on reducing CO2 is focused on the electricity sector.  The U.S. is responsible for 14% of world CO2 emissions, and our electricity generation creates less than 4% of world emissions.  All the effort being put into U.S. renewable electricity will have no important effect on global warming, assuming that global warming is even real.  The real source of CO2 emissions is China and India among others.\nI will explain how renewable energy quotas subsidize solar.  The argument for wind is similar but different in various details.  To see how big the subsidy is, I will compare an imaginary, unsubsidized solar electricity business with the existing situation, propped up by subsidies and quotas.\nOur imaginary unsubsidized solar business is going to sell electricity to various utilities that its electricity can reach via the transmission networks that are open to companies exchanging electricity.\nSolar electricity is erratic electricity.  You get it during the day, when the sun is not obscured by clouds.  The utilities that deliver electricity must supply electricity in a predictable and non-erratic manner.  Why would any utility even want erratic electricity?  The answer is that the utility can use its existing plants to compensate for the erratic nature of the solar.  The value to the utility of the solar electricity is the value of the fuel saved in its existing plants when solar electricity is actually flowing.  Solar can\u2019t replace existing plants because sometimes it\u2019s not there, particularly in the early evening, when electricity demand often peaks.  On the negative side, solar lowers the utilization of its existing plants and stresses them more, increasing the cost of electricity from existing plants.\nTo summarize a complicated story, solar electricity is worth about $20 per megawatt-hour to a typical utility.\nOur imaginary company with a speculative market and no guarantees would need an 8% return over a 10-year period to justify the investment.  Under these conditions, it is not remotely possible to sell solar electricity for $20 and get the 8% return appropriate to this speculative business.  The company would have to get about $100 per megawatt-hour to stay in business.  One hundred dollars per megawatt-hour is the true price of solar electricity in a free market\nThe proselytizers for renewable energy have cleverly created a good business by convincing states to set quotas for renewable energy.  Because there is a quota, the utilities will sign contracts that will result in providing the needed supply.  The quotas are justified on the grounds of saving the Earth from global warming, but even if global warming is a real danger, the problem is in Asia, not in the U.S. electricity sector.  By banning hydro and nuclear on spurious grounds, the wind and solar industry has fended off the competition for CO2-free electricity.\nThe experts, like James Hansen and Michael Shellenberger, who really, really believe in global warming, are loudly saying the solution is nuclear, not wind or solar.\nIt\u2019s time to get rid of the subsidies and quotas and put these scammers out of business.", "label": 1}, "text-776": {"text": "The 10 best plays about politics\nWhose side is Shakespeare on? As always, it is difficult to tell. Coriolanus is an arrogant military patrician who proves indispensable to the state. The people\u2019s tribunes have a legitimate grievance against a hero who has sanctioned civic starvation, while themselves being devious manipulators. Claimed as both an incitement to revolution and a piece of quasi-fascist hero-worship, the play is magnificently ambivalent.\nThis is world drama\u2019s \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d moment. When a brutally rapacious military commander is killed, the inhabitants of a Spanish village are tortured to disclose the name of his murderer. Their joint cry of \u201cFuenteovejuna did it\u201d is a momentous tribute to the power of collective action. Yet Lope\u2019s ultimate endorsement of monarchical authority suggests that even popular protest, here led by women, is tinged with historical irony.\nNo one understood better than Schiller the devious machinations of politics. On the face of it this is a romantic tragedy about two warring queens, Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart. But the greatest scene shows Elizabeth beset by contradictory arguments about Mary\u2019s fate. Some argue for execution, others for clemency, while Leicester ingeniously suggests that Mary should live \u201cin the shadow of the axe\u201d. This is power in action with each case reflecting the tactical acumen of the speaker.\nAny number of Brecht plays would qualify but this is the one that has proved most distressingly relevant to our times. Brecht tells the story of the rise of Hitler, from his beginnings to the occupation of Austria, in terms of Chicago gang warfare. Arturo is one of the great roles in modern drama, and when the actor who plays him finally turns to the audience and says of the hero, \u201cthe bitch that bore him is in heat again\u201d, we hear a chillingly accurate prophecy.\nMiller\u2019s historical drama about the Salem witch trials of 1692 was inspired by Senator Joe McCarthy\u2019s House Un-American Activities Committee and its persecution of suspected communists. Yet the play has unexpected resonances today. It is about a community plagued by guilt, suspicion and fear. As Ya\u00ebl Farber\u2019s 2014 revival at the Old Vic reminded us, the politics includes an older man\u2019s abuse of his power over a young girl.\nOne of the great neglected modern plays. Griffiths\u2019 theme is the reasons for the failure of revolution in Britain. His chosen form is dialectical debate. An LSE lecturer, a Glaswegian Trotskyite and a northern playwright all put their case with Shavian fervour in the drawing room of a leftwing TV producer. But the key line belongs to the hard-headed old Trot who argues: \u201cYou enjoy biting the hand that feeds you but you\u2019ll never bite it off.\u201d\nCan you have feminism without socialism? That was the question posed by Churchill in this haunting, formally inventive play. Written when Thatcherism was in full flow, it shows the dynamic head of an employment agency denying her working-class roots \u2013 and her own daughter \u2013 in the pursuit of power. Only at the end does Churchill\u2019s protagonist realise the dubious bargain she has made in adopting inherited masculine definitions of success.\nA high-ranking government official confronts three of his imprisoned torture victims. We think we know where we stand. But Pinter, with immense subtlety, shows that the power-wielding Nicolas, while relying on a righteous belief in the family, the state and religion, is a deeply flawed and insecure figure who cannot grasp either the instinctive personal loyalties or the principled morality of the people at his mercy.\nIt may seem hypocritical to include this, since I was one of the many critics who attacked Kane\u2019s play on its first showing. While I still think the piece has flaws, repeated viewings have convinced me of its moral and political force. Showing a civil war erupting into a Leeds hotel room, it passionately argues there is an umbilical link between the pain people inflict on each other and the brutality of public violence.\nMixing documented fact with imaginative speculation, Hare\u2019s play examined the political process that drove the United States, with British support, to go to war with Iraq. Everything we have learned since has justified Hare\u2019s arguments: that the Bush administration was preoccupied with regime change, that it cynically used 9/11 as a pretext for invasion and that it relentlessly crushed internal opposition.
